# Model field reference

This document contains all the API references of `Field` including the field
options and field types Django offers.

See also

If the built-in fields don’t do the trick, you can try django-localflavor
(documentation), which contains assorted pieces of code that are useful for
particular countries and cultures.

Also, you can easily write your own custom model fields.

Note

Technically, these models are defined in `django.db.models.fields`, but for
convenience they’re imported into `django.db.models`; the standard convention
is to use `from django.db import models` and refer to fields as
`models.<Foo>Field`.

## Field options

The following arguments are available to all field types. All are optional.

### `null`

`Field.null`

If `True`, Django will store empty values as `NULL` in the database. Default
is `False`.

Avoid using `null` on string-based fields such as `CharField` and `TextField`.
If a string-based field has `null=True`, that means it has two possible values
for “no data”: `NULL`, and the empty string. In most cases, it’s redundant to
have two possible values for “no data;” the Django convention is to use the
empty string, not `NULL`. One exception is when a `CharField` has both
`unique=True` and `blank=True` set. In this situation, `null=True` is required
to avoid unique constraint violations when saving multiple objects with blank
values.

For both string-based and non-string-based fields, you will also need to set
`blank=True` if you wish to permit empty values in forms, as the `null`
parameter only affects database storage (see `blank`).

Note

When using the Oracle database backend, the value `NULL` will be stored to
denote the empty string regardless of this attribute.

### `blank`

`Field.blank`

If `True`, the field is allowed to be blank. Default is `False`.

Note that this is different than `null`. `null` is purely database-related,
whereas `blank` is validation-related. If a field has `blank=True`, form
validation will allow entry of an empty value. If a field has `blank=False`,
the field will be required.

Supplying missing values

`blank=True` can be used with fields having `null=False`, but this will
require implementing `clean()` on the model in order to programmatically
supply any missing values.

### `choices`

`Field.choices`

A sequence consisting itself of iterables of exactly two items (e.g. `[(A, B),
(A, B) ...]`) to use as choices for this field. If choices are given, they’re
enforced by model validation and the default form widget will be a select box
with these choices instead of the standard text field.

The first element in each tuple is the actual value to be set on the model,
and the second element is the human-readable name. For example:

    
    YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = [
        ('FR', 'Freshman'),
        ('SO', 'Sophomore'),
        ('JR', 'Junior'),
        ('SR', 'Senior'),
        ('GR', 'Graduate'),
    ]
    
Generally, it’s best to define choices inside a model class, and to define a
suitably-named constant for each value:

    
    from django.db import models
    
    class Student(models.Model):
        FRESHMAN = 'FR'
        SOPHOMORE = 'SO'
        JUNIOR = 'JR'
        SENIOR = 'SR'
        GRADUATE = 'GR'
        YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES = [
            (FRESHMAN, 'Freshman'),
            (SOPHOMORE, 'Sophomore'),
            (JUNIOR, 'Junior'),
            (SENIOR, 'Senior'),
            (GRADUATE, 'Graduate'),
        ]
        year_in_school = models.CharField(
            max_length=2,
            choices=YEAR_IN_SCHOOL_CHOICES,
            default=FRESHMAN,
        )
    
        def is_upperclass(self):
            return self.year_in_school in {self.JUNIOR, self.SENIOR}
    
Though you can define a choices list outside of a model class and then refer
to it, defining the choices and names for each choice inside the model class
keeps all of that information with the class that uses it, and helps reference
the choices (e.g, `Student.SOPHOMORE` will work anywhere that the `Student`
model has been imported).

You can also collect your available choices into named groups that can be used
for organizational purposes:

    
    MEDIA_CHOICES = [
        ('Audio', (
                ('vinyl', 'Vinyl'),
                ('cd', 'CD'),
            )
        ),
        ('Video', (
                ('vhs', 'VHS Tape'),
                ('dvd', 'DVD'),
            )
        ),
        ('unknown', 'Unknown'),
    ]
    
The first element in each tuple is the name to apply to the group. The second
element is an iterable of 2-tuples, with each 2-tuple containing a value and a
human-readable name for an option. Grouped options may be combined with
ungrouped options within a single list (such as the `'unknown'` option in this
example).

For each model field that has `choices` set, Django will add a method to
retrieve the human-readable name for the field’s current value. See
`get_FOO_display()` in the database API documentation.

Note that choices can be any sequence object – not necessarily a list or
tuple. This lets you construct choices dynamically. But if you find yourself
hacking `choices` to be dynamic, you’re probably better off using a proper
database table with a `ForeignKey`. `choices` is meant for static data that
doesn’t change much, if ever.

Note

A new migration is created each time the order of `choices` changes.

Unless `blank=False` is set on the field along with a `default` then a label
containing `"---------"` will be rendered with the select box. To override
this behavior, add a tuple to `choices` containing `None`; e.g. `(None, 'Your
String For Display')`. Alternatively, you can use an empty string instead of
`None` where this makes sense - such as on a `CharField`.

#### Enumeration types

In addition, Django provides enumeration types that you can subclass to define
choices in a concise way:

    
    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
    
    class Student(models.Model):
    
        class YearInSchool(models.TextChoices):
            FRESHMAN = 'FR', _('Freshman')
            SOPHOMORE = 'SO', _('Sophomore')
            JUNIOR = 'JR', _('Junior')
            SENIOR = 'SR', _('Senior')
            GRADUATE = 'GR', _('Graduate')
    
        year_in_school = models.CharField(
            max_length=2,
            choices=YearInSchool.choices,
            default=YearInSchool.FRESHMAN,
        )
    
        def is_upperclass(self):
            return self.year_in_school in {
                self.YearInSchool.JUNIOR,
                self.YearInSchool.SENIOR,
            }
    
These work similar to `enum` from Python’s standard library, but with some
modifications:

  * Enum member values are a tuple of arguments to use when constructing the concrete data type. Django supports adding an extra string value to the end of this tuple to be used as the human-readable name, or `label`. The `label` can be a lazy translatable string. Thus, in most cases, the member value will be a `(value, label)` two-tuple. See below for an example of subclassing choices using a more complex data type. If a tuple is not provided, or the last item is not a (lazy) string, the `label` is automatically generated from the member name. 
  * A `.label` property is added on values, to return the human-readable name. 
  * A number of custom properties are added to the enumeration classes – `.choices`, `.labels`, `.values`, and `.names` – to make it easier to access lists of those separate parts of the enumeration. Use `.choices` as a suitable value to pass to `choices` in a field definition.
Warning

These property names cannot be used as member names as they would conflict.

  * The use of `enum.unique()` is enforced to ensure that values cannot be defined multiple times. This is unlikely to be expected in choices for a field. 

Note that using `YearInSchool.SENIOR`, `YearInSchool['SENIOR']`, or
`YearInSchool('SR')` to access or lookup enum members work as expected, as do
the `.name` and `.value` properties on the members.

If you don’t need to have the human-readable names translated, you can have
them inferred from the member name (replacing underscores with spaces and
using title-case):

    
    >>> class Vehicle(models.TextChoices):
    ...     CAR = 'C'
    ...     TRUCK = 'T'
    ...     JET_SKI = 'J'
    ...
    >>> Vehicle.JET_SKI.label
    'Jet Ski'
    
Since the case where the enum values need to be integers is extremely common,
Django provides an `IntegerChoices` class. For example:

    
    class Card(models.Model):
    
        class Suit(models.IntegerChoices):
            DIAMOND = 1
            SPADE = 2
            HEART = 3
            CLUB = 4
    
        suit = models.IntegerField(choices=Suit.choices)
    
It is also possible to make use of the Enum Functional API with the caveat
that labels are automatically generated as highlighted above:

    
    >>> MedalType = models.TextChoices('MedalType', 'GOLD SILVER BRONZE')
    >>> MedalType.choices
    [('GOLD', 'Gold'), ('SILVER', 'Silver'), ('BRONZE', 'Bronze')]
    >>> Place = models.IntegerChoices('Place', 'FIRST SECOND THIRD')
    >>> Place.choices
    [(1, 'First'), (2, 'Second'), (3, 'Third')]
    
If you require support for a concrete data type other than `int` or `str`, you
can subclass `Choices` and the required concrete data type, e.g. `date` for
use with `DateField`:

    
    class MoonLandings(datetime.date, models.Choices):
        APOLLO_11 = 1969, 7, 20, 'Apollo 11 (Eagle)'
        APOLLO_12 = 1969, 11, 19, 'Apollo 12 (Intrepid)'
        APOLLO_14 = 1971, 2, 5, 'Apollo 14 (Antares)'
        APOLLO_15 = 1971, 7, 30, 'Apollo 15 (Falcon)'
        APOLLO_16 = 1972, 4, 21, 'Apollo 16 (Orion)'
        APOLLO_17 = 1972, 12, 11, 'Apollo 17 (Challenger)'
    
There are some additional caveats to be aware of:

  * Enumeration types do not support named groups. 
  * Because an enumeration with a concrete data type requires all values to match the type, overriding the blank label cannot be achieved by creating a member with a value of `None`. Instead, set the `__empty__` attribute on the class:
        class Answer(models.IntegerChoices):
        NO = 0, _('No')
        YES = 1, _('Yes')
    
        __empty__ = _('(Unknown)')
    

### `db_column`

`Field.db_column`

The name of the database column to use for this field. If this isn’t given,
Django will use the field’s name.

If your database column name is an SQL reserved word, or contains characters
that aren’t allowed in Python variable names – notably, the hyphen – that’s
OK. Django quotes column and table names behind the scenes.

### `db_index`

`Field.db_index`

If `True`, a database index will be created for this field.

### `db_tablespace`

`Field.db_tablespace`

The name of the database tablespace to use for this field’s index, if this
field is indexed. The default is the project’s `DEFAULT_INDEX_TABLESPACE`
setting, if set, or the `db_tablespace` of the model, if any. If the backend
doesn’t support tablespaces for indexes, this option is ignored.

### `default`

`Field.default`

The default value for the field. This can be a value or a callable object. If
callable it will be called every time a new object is created.

The default can’t be a mutable object (model instance, `list`, `set`, etc.),
as a reference to the same instance of that object would be used as the
default value in all new model instances. Instead, wrap the desired default in
a callable. For example, if you want to specify a default `dict` for
`JSONField`, use a function:

    
    def contact_default():
        return {"email": "to1@example.com"}
    
    contact_info = JSONField("ContactInfo", default=contact_default)
    
`lambda`s can’t be used for field options like `default` because they can’t be
serialized by migrations. See that documentation for other caveats.

For fields like `ForeignKey` that map to model instances, defaults should be
the value of the field they reference (`pk` unless `to_field` is set) instead
of model instances.

The default value is used when new model instances are created and a value
isn’t provided for the field. When the field is a primary key, the default is
also used when the field is set to `None`.

### `editable`

`Field.editable`

If `False`, the field will not be displayed in the admin or any other
`ModelForm`. They are also skipped during model validation. Default is `True`.

### `error_messages`

`Field.error_messages`

The `error_messages` argument lets you override the default messages that the
field will raise. Pass in a dictionary with keys matching the error messages
you want to override.

Error message keys include `null`, `blank`, `invalid`, `invalid_choice`,
`unique`, and `unique_for_date`. Additional error message keys are specified
for each field in the Field types section below.

These error messages often don’t propagate to forms. See Considerations
regarding model’s error_messages.

### `help_text`

`Field.help_text`

Extra “help” text to be displayed with the form widget. It’s useful for
documentation even if your field isn’t used on a form.

Note that this value is not HTML-escaped in automatically-generated forms.
This lets you include HTML in `help_text` if you so desire. For example:

    
    help_text="Please use the following format: <em>YYYY-MM-DD</em>."
    
Alternatively you can use plain text and `django.utils.html.escape()` to
escape any HTML special characters. Ensure that you escape any help text that
may come from untrusted users to avoid a cross-site scripting attack.

### `primary_key`

`Field.primary_key`

If `True`, this field is the primary key for the model.

If you don’t specify `primary_key=True` for any field in your model, Django
will automatically add a field to hold the primary key, so you don’t need to
set `primary_key=True` on any of your fields unless you want to override the
default primary-key behavior. The type of auto-created primary key fields can
be specified per app in `AppConfig.default_auto_field` or globally in the
`DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting. For more, see Automatic primary key fields.

`primary_key=True` implies `null=False` and `unique=True`. Only one primary
key is allowed on an object.

The primary key field is read-only. If you change the value of the primary key
on an existing object and then save it, a new object will be created alongside
the old one.

Changed in Django 3.2:

In older versions, auto-created primary key fields were always `AutoField`s.

### `unique`

`Field.unique`

If `True`, this field must be unique throughout the table.

This is enforced at the database level and by model validation. If you try to
save a model with a duplicate value in a `unique` field, a
`django.db.IntegrityError` will be raised by the model’s `save()` method.

This option is valid on all field types except `ManyToManyField` and
`OneToOneField`.

Note that when `unique` is `True`, you don’t need to specify `db_index`,
because `unique` implies the creation of an index.

### `unique_for_date`

`Field.unique_for_date`

Set this to the name of a `DateField` or `DateTimeField` to require that this
field be unique for the value of the date field.

For example, if you have a field `title` that has
`unique_for_date="pub_date"`, then Django wouldn’t allow the entry of two
records with the same `title` and `pub_date`.

Note that if you set this to point to a `DateTimeField`, only the date portion
of the field will be considered. Besides, when `USE_TZ` is `True`, the check
will be performed in the current time zone at the time the object gets saved.

This is enforced by `Model.validate_unique()` during model validation but not
at the database level. If any `unique_for_date` constraint involves fields
that are not part of a `ModelForm` (for example, if one of the fields is
listed in `exclude` or has `editable=False`), `Model.validate_unique()` will
skip validation for that particular constraint.

### `unique_for_month`

`Field.unique_for_month`

Like `unique_for_date`, but requires the field to be unique with respect to
the month.

### `unique_for_year`

`Field.unique_for_year`

Like `unique_for_date` and `unique_for_month`.

### `verbose_name`

`Field.verbose_name`

A human-readable name for the field. If the verbose name isn’t given, Django
will automatically create it using the field’s attribute name, converting
underscores to spaces. See Verbose field names.

### `validators`

`Field.validators`

A list of validators to run for this field. See the validators documentation
for more information.

#### Registering and fetching lookups

`Field` implements the lookup registration API. The API can be used to
customize which lookups are available for a field class, and how lookups are
fetched from a field.

## Field types

### `AutoField`

`class AutoField(**options)`

An `IntegerField` that automatically increments according to available IDs.
You usually won’t need to use this directly; a primary key field will
automatically be added to your model if you don’t specify otherwise. See
Automatic primary key fields.

### `BigAutoField`

`class BigAutoField(**options)`

A 64-bit integer, much like an `AutoField` except that it is guaranteed to fit
numbers from `1` to `9223372036854775807`.

### `BigIntegerField`

`class BigIntegerField(**options)`

A 64-bit integer, much like an `IntegerField` except that it is guaranteed to
fit numbers from `-9223372036854775808` to `9223372036854775807`. The default
form widget for this field is a `NumberInput`.

### `BinaryField`

`class BinaryField(max_length=None, **options)`

A field to store raw binary data. It can be assigned `bytes`, `bytearray`, or
`memoryview`.

By default, `BinaryField` sets `editable` to `False`, in which case it can’t
be included in a `ModelForm`.

`BinaryField` has one extra optional argument:

`BinaryField.max_length`

    
The maximum length (in bytes) of the field. The maximum length is enforced in
Django’s validation using `MaxLengthValidator`.

Abusing `BinaryField`

Although you might think about storing files in the database, consider that it
is bad design in 99% of the cases. This field is not a replacement for proper
static files handling.

### `BooleanField`

`class BooleanField(**options)`

A true/false field.

The default form widget for this field is `CheckboxInput`, or
`NullBooleanSelect` if `null=True`.

The default value of `BooleanField` is `None` when `Field.default` isn’t
defined.

### `CharField`

`class CharField(max_length=None, **options)`

A string field, for small- to large-sized strings.

For large amounts of text, use `TextField`.

The default form widget for this field is a `TextInput`.

`CharField` has two extra arguments:

`CharField.max_length`

    
Required. The maximum length (in characters) of the field. The max_length is
enforced at the database level and in Django’s validation using
`MaxLengthValidator`.

Note

If you are writing an application that must be portable to multiple database
backends, you should be aware that there are restrictions on `max_length` for
some backends. Refer to the database backend notes for details.

`CharField.db_collation`

    
New in Django 3.2.

Optional. The database collation name of the field.

Note

Collation names are not standardized. As such, this will not be portable
across multiple database backends.

Oracle

Oracle supports collations only when the `MAX_STRING_SIZE` database
initialization parameter is set to `EXTENDED`.

### `DateField`

`class DateField(auto_now=False, auto_now_add=False, **options)`

A date, represented in Python by a `datetime.date` instance. Has a few extra,
optional arguments:

`DateField.auto_now`

    
Automatically set the field to now every time the object is saved. Useful for
“last-modified” timestamps. Note that the current date is always used; it’s
not just a default value that you can override.

The field is only automatically updated when calling `Model.save()`. The field
isn’t updated when making updates to other fields in other ways such as
`QuerySet.update()`, though you can specify a custom value for the field in an
update like that.

`DateField.auto_now_add`

    
Automatically set the field to now when the object is first created. Useful
for creation of timestamps. Note that the current date is always used; it’s
not just a default value that you can override. So even if you set a value for
this field when creating the object, it will be ignored. If you want to be
able to modify this field, set the following instead of `auto_now_add=True`:

  * For `DateField`: `default=date.today` \- from `datetime.date.today()`
  * For `DateTimeField`: `default=timezone.now` \- from `django.utils.timezone.now()`

The default form widget for this field is a `DateInput`. The admin adds a
JavaScript calendar, and a shortcut for “Today”. Includes an additional
`invalid_date` error message key.

The options `auto_now_add`, `auto_now`, and `default` are mutually exclusive.
Any combination of these options will result in an error.

Note

As currently implemented, setting `auto_now` or `auto_now_add` to `True` will
cause the field to have `editable=False` and `blank=True` set.

Note

The `auto_now` and `auto_now_add` options will always use the date in the
default timezone at the moment of creation or update. If you need something
different, you may want to consider using your own callable default or
overriding `save()` instead of using `auto_now` or `auto_now_add`; or using a
`DateTimeField` instead of a `DateField` and deciding how to handle the
conversion from datetime to date at display time.

### `DateTimeField`

`class DateTimeField(auto_now=False, auto_now_add=False, **options)`

A date and time, represented in Python by a `datetime.datetime` instance.
Takes the same extra arguments as `DateField`.

The default form widget for this field is a single `DateTimeInput`. The admin
uses two separate `TextInput` widgets with JavaScript shortcuts.

### `DecimalField`

`class DecimalField(max_digits=None, decimal_places=None, **options)`

A fixed-precision decimal number, represented in Python by a `Decimal`
instance. It validates the input using `DecimalValidator`.

Has two required arguments:

`DecimalField.max_digits`

    
The maximum number of digits allowed in the number. Note that this number must
be greater than or equal to `decimal_places`.

`DecimalField.decimal_places`

    
The number of decimal places to store with the number.

For example, to store numbers up to `999` with a resolution of 2 decimal
places, you’d use:

    
    models.DecimalField(..., max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)
    
And to store numbers up to approximately one billion with a resolution of 10
decimal places:

    
    models.DecimalField(..., max_digits=19, decimal_places=10)
    
The default form widget for this field is a `NumberInput` when `localize` is
`False` or `TextInput` otherwise.

Note

For more information about the differences between the `FloatField` and
`DecimalField` classes, please see FloatField vs. DecimalField. You should
also be aware of SQLite limitations of decimal fields.

### `DurationField`

`class DurationField(**options)`

A field for storing periods of time - modeled in Python by `timedelta`. When
used on PostgreSQL, the data type used is an `interval` and on Oracle the data
type is `INTERVAL DAY(9) TO SECOND(6)`. Otherwise a `bigint` of microseconds
is used.

Note

Arithmetic with `DurationField` works in most cases. However on all databases
other than PostgreSQL, comparing the value of a `DurationField` to arithmetic
on `DateTimeField` instances will not work as expected.

### `EmailField`

`class EmailField(max_length=254, **options)`

A `CharField` that checks that the value is a valid email address using
`EmailValidator`.

### `FileField`

`class FileField(upload_to=None, max_length=100, **options)`

A file-upload field.

Note

The `primary_key` argument isn’t supported and will raise an error if used.

Has two optional arguments:

`FileField.upload_to`

    
This attribute provides a way of setting the upload directory and file name,
and can be set in two ways. In both cases, the value is passed to the
`Storage.save()` method.

If you specify a string value or a `Path`, it may contain `strftime()`
formatting, which will be replaced by the date/time of the file upload (so
that uploaded files don’t fill up the given directory). For example:

    
    class MyModel(models.Model):
        # file will be uploaded to MEDIA_ROOT/uploads
        upload = models.FileField(upload_to='uploads/')
        # or...
        # file will be saved to MEDIA_ROOT/uploads/2015/01/30
        upload = models.FileField(upload_to='uploads/%Y/%m/%d/')
    
If you are using the default `FileSystemStorage`, the string value will be
appended to your `MEDIA_ROOT` path to form the location on the local
filesystem where uploaded files will be stored. If you are using a different
storage, check that storage’s documentation to see how it handles `upload_to`.

`upload_to` may also be a callable, such as a function. This will be called to
obtain the upload path, including the filename. This callable must accept two
arguments and return a Unix-style path (with forward slashes) to be passed
along to the storage system. The two arguments are:

Argument | Description  
---|---  
`instance` |  An instance of the model where the `FileField` is defined. More specifically, this is the particular instance where the current file is being attached. In most cases, this object will not have been saved to the database yet, so if it uses the default `AutoField`, it might not yet have a value for its primary key field.  
`filename` | The filename that was originally given to the file. This may or may not be taken into account when determining the final destination path.  
For example:

    
    def user_directory_path(instance, filename):
        # file will be uploaded to MEDIA_ROOT/user_<id>/<filename>
        return 'user_{0}/{1}'.format(instance.user.id, filename)
    
    class MyModel(models.Model):
        upload = models.FileField(upload_to=user_directory_path)
    
`FileField.storage`

    
A storage object, or a callable which returns a storage object. This handles
the storage and retrieval of your files. See Managing files for details on how
to provide this object.

The default form widget for this field is a `ClearableFileInput`.

Using a `FileField` or an `ImageField` (see below) in a model takes a few
steps:

  1. In your settings file, you’ll need to define `MEDIA_ROOT` as the full path to a directory where you’d like Django to store uploaded files. (For performance, these files are not stored in the database.) Define `MEDIA_URL` as the base public URL of that directory. Make sure that this directory is writable by the web server’s user account.
  2. Add the `FileField` or `ImageField` to your model, defining the `upload_to` option to specify a subdirectory of `MEDIA_ROOT` to use for uploaded files.
  3. All that will be stored in your database is a path to the file (relative to `MEDIA_ROOT`). You’ll most likely want to use the convenience `url` attribute provided by Django. For example, if your `ImageField` is called `mug_shot`, you can get the absolute path to your image in a template with `{{ object.mug_shot.url }}`.

For example, say your `MEDIA_ROOT` is set to `'/home/media'`, and `upload_to`
is set to `'photos/%Y/%m/%d'`. The `'%Y/%m/%d'` part of `upload_to` is
`strftime()` formatting; `'%Y'` is the four-digit year, `'%m'` is the two-
digit month and `'%d'` is the two-digit day. If you upload a file on Jan. 15,
2007, it will be saved in the directory `/home/media/photos/2007/01/15`.

If you wanted to retrieve the uploaded file’s on-disk filename, or the file’s
size, you could use the `name` and `size` attributes respectively; for more
information on the available attributes and methods, see the `File` class
reference and the Managing files topic guide.

Note

The file is saved as part of saving the model in the database, so the actual
file name used on disk cannot be relied on until after the model has been
saved.

The uploaded file’s relative URL can be obtained using the `url` attribute.
Internally, this calls the `url()` method of the underlying `Storage` class.

Note that whenever you deal with uploaded files, you should pay close
attention to where you’re uploading them and what type of files they are, to
avoid security holes. Validate all uploaded files so that you’re sure the
files are what you think they are. For example, if you blindly let somebody
upload files, without validation, to a directory that’s within your web
server’s document root, then somebody could upload a CGI or PHP script and
execute that script by visiting its URL on your site. Don’t allow that.

Also note that even an uploaded HTML file, since it can be executed by the
browser (though not by the server), can pose security threats that are
equivalent to XSS or CSRF attacks.

`FileField` instances are created in your database as `varchar` columns with a
default max length of 100 characters. As with other fields, you can change the
maximum length using the `max_length` argument.

####  `FileField` and `FieldFile`

`class FieldFile`

When you access a `FileField` on a model, you are given an instance of
`FieldFile` as a proxy for accessing the underlying file.

The API of `FieldFile` mirrors that of `File`, with one key difference: The
object wrapped by the class is not necessarily a wrapper around Python’s
built-in file object. Instead, it is a wrapper around the result of the
`Storage.open()` method, which may be a `File` object, or it may be a custom
storage’s implementation of the `File` API.

In addition to the API inherited from `File` such as `read()` and `write()`,
`FieldFile` includes several methods that can be used to interact with the
underlying file:

Warning

Two methods of this class, `save()` and `delete()`, default to saving the
model object of the associated `FieldFile` in the database.

`FieldFile.name`

The name of the file including the relative path from the root of the
`Storage` of the associated `FileField`.

`FieldFile.path`

A read-only property to access the file’s local filesystem path by calling the
`path()` method of the underlying `Storage` class.

`FieldFile.size`

The result of the underlying `Storage.size()` method.

`FieldFile.url`

A read-only property to access the file’s relative URL by calling the `url()`
method of the underlying `Storage` class.

`FieldFile.open(mode='rb')`

Opens or reopens the file associated with this instance in the specified
`mode`. Unlike the standard Python `open()` method, it doesn’t return a file
descriptor.

Since the underlying file is opened implicitly when accessing it, it may be
unnecessary to call this method except to reset the pointer to the underlying
file or to change the `mode`.

`FieldFile.close()`

Behaves like the standard Python `file.close()` method and closes the file
associated with this instance.

`FieldFile.save(name, content, save=True)`

This method takes a filename and file contents and passes them to the storage
class for the field, then associates the stored file with the model field. If
you want to manually associate file data with `FileField` instances on your
model, the `save()` method is used to persist that file data.

Takes two required arguments: `name` which is the name of the file, and
`content` which is an object containing the file’s contents. The optional
`save` argument controls whether or not the model instance is saved after the
file associated with this field has been altered. Defaults to `True`.

Note that the `content` argument should be an instance of
`django.core.files.File`, not Python’s built-in file object. You can construct
a `File` from an existing Python file object like this:

    
    from django.core.files import File
    # Open an existing file using Python's built-in open()
    f = open('/path/to/hello.world')
    myfile = File(f)
    
Or you can construct one from a Python string like this:

    
    from django.core.files.base import ContentFile
    myfile = ContentFile("hello world")
    
For more information, see Managing files.

`FieldFile.delete(save=True)`

Deletes the file associated with this instance and clears all attributes on
the field. Note: This method will close the file if it happens to be open when
`delete()` is called.

The optional `save` argument controls whether or not the model instance is
saved after the file associated with this field has been deleted. Defaults to
`True`.

Note that when a model is deleted, related files are not deleted. If you need
to cleanup orphaned files, you’ll need to handle it yourself (for instance,
with a custom management command that can be run manually or scheduled to run
periodically via e.g. cron).

### `FilePathField`

`class FilePathField(path='', match=None, recursive=False, allow_files=True,
allow_folders=False, max_length=100, **options)`

A `CharField` whose choices are limited to the filenames in a certain
directory on the filesystem. Has some special arguments, of which the first is
required:

`FilePathField.path`

    
Required. The absolute filesystem path to a directory from which this
`FilePathField` should get its choices. Example: `"/home/images"`.

`path` may also be a callable, such as a function to dynamically set the path
at runtime. Example:

    
    import os
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.db import models
    
    def images_path():
        return os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'images')
    
    class MyModel(models.Model):
        file = models.FilePathField(path=images_path)
    
`FilePathField.match`

    
Optional. A regular expression, as a string, that `FilePathField` will use to
filter filenames. Note that the regex will be applied to the base filename,
not the full path. Example: `"foo.*\.txt$"`, which will match a file called
`foo23.txt` but not `bar.txt` or `foo23.png`.

`FilePathField.recursive`

    
Optional. Either `True` or `False`. Default is `False`. Specifies whether all
subdirectories of `path` should be included

`FilePathField.allow_files`

    
Optional. Either `True` or `False`. Default is `True`. Specifies whether files
in the specified location should be included. Either this or `allow_folders`
must be `True`.

`FilePathField.allow_folders`

    
Optional. Either `True` or `False`. Default is `False`. Specifies whether
folders in the specified location should be included. Either this or
`allow_files` must be `True`.

The one potential gotcha is that `match` applies to the base filename, not the
full path. So, this example:

    
    FilePathField(path="/home/images", match="foo.*", recursive=True)
    
…will match `/home/images/foo.png` but not `/home/images/foo/bar.png` because
the `match` applies to the base filename (`foo.png` and `bar.png`).

`FilePathField` instances are created in your database as `varchar` columns
with a default max length of 100 characters. As with other fields, you can
change the maximum length using the `max_length` argument.

### `FloatField`

`class FloatField(**options)`

A floating-point number represented in Python by a `float` instance.

The default form widget for this field is a `NumberInput` when `localize` is
`False` or `TextInput` otherwise.

`FloatField` vs. `DecimalField`

The `FloatField` class is sometimes mixed up with the `DecimalField` class.
Although they both represent real numbers, they represent those numbers
differently. `FloatField` uses Python’s `float` type internally, while
`DecimalField` uses Python’s `Decimal` type. For information on the difference
between the two, see Python’s documentation for the `decimal` module.

### `GenericIPAddressField`

`class GenericIPAddressField(protocol='both', unpack_ipv4=False, **options)`

An IPv4 or IPv6 address, in string format (e.g. `192.0.2.30` or
`2a02:42fe::4`). The default form widget for this field is a `TextInput`.

The IPv6 address normalization follows RFC 4291#section-2.2 section 2.2,
including using the IPv4 format suggested in paragraph 3 of that section, like
`::ffff:192.0.2.0`. For example, `2001:0::0:01` would be normalized to
`2001::1`, and `::ffff:0a0a:0a0a` to `::ffff:10.10.10.10`. All characters are
converted to lowercase.

`GenericIPAddressField.protocol`

    
Limits valid inputs to the specified protocol. Accepted values are `'both'`
(default), `'IPv4'` or `'IPv6'`. Matching is case insensitive.

`GenericIPAddressField.unpack_ipv4`

    
Unpacks IPv4 mapped addresses like `::ffff:192.0.2.1`. If this option is
enabled that address would be unpacked to `192.0.2.1`. Default is disabled.
Can only be used when `protocol` is set to `'both'`.

If you allow for blank values, you have to allow for null values since blank
values are stored as null.

### `ImageField`

`class ImageField(upload_to=None, height_field=None, width_field=None,
max_length=100, **options)`

Inherits all attributes and methods from `FileField`, but also validates that
the uploaded object is a valid image.

In addition to the special attributes that are available for `FileField`, an
`ImageField` also has `height` and `width` attributes.

To facilitate querying on those attributes, `ImageField` has two extra
optional arguments:

`ImageField.height_field`

    
Name of a model field which will be auto-populated with the height of the
image each time the model instance is saved.

`ImageField.width_field`

    
Name of a model field which will be auto-populated with the width of the image
each time the model instance is saved.

Requires the Pillow library.

`ImageField` instances are created in your database as `varchar` columns with
a default max length of 100 characters. As with other fields, you can change
the maximum length using the `max_length` argument.

The default form widget for this field is a `ClearableFileInput`.

### `IntegerField`

`class IntegerField(**options)`

An integer. Values from `-2147483648` to `2147483647` are safe in all
databases supported by Django.

It uses `MinValueValidator` and `MaxValueValidator` to validate the input
based on the values that the default database supports.

The default form widget for this field is a `NumberInput` when `localize` is
`False` or `TextInput` otherwise.

### `JSONField`

`class JSONField(encoder=None, decoder=None, **options)`

A field for storing JSON encoded data. In Python the data is represented in
its Python native format: dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, booleans and
`None`.

`JSONField` is supported on MariaDB 10.2.7+, MySQL 5.7.8+, Oracle, PostgreSQL,
and SQLite (with the JSON1 extension enabled).

`JSONField.encoder`

    
An optional `json.JSONEncoder` subclass to serialize data types not supported
by the standard JSON serializer (e.g. `datetime.datetime` or `UUID`). For
example, you can use the `DjangoJSONEncoder` class.

Defaults to `json.JSONEncoder`.

`JSONField.decoder`

    
An optional `json.JSONDecoder` subclass to deserialize the value retrieved
from the database. The value will be in the format chosen by the custom
encoder (most often a string). Your deserialization may need to account for
the fact that you can’t be certain of the input type. For example, you run the
risk of returning a `datetime` that was actually a string that just happened
to be in the same format chosen for `datetime`s.

Defaults to `json.JSONDecoder`.

If you give the field a `default`, ensure it’s an immutable object, such as a
`str`, or a callable object that returns a fresh mutable object each time,
such as `dict` or a function. Providing a mutable default object like
`default={}` or `default=[]` shares the one object between all model
instances.

To query `JSONField` in the database, see Querying JSONField.

Indexing

`Index` and `Field.db_index` both create a B-tree index, which isn’t
particularly helpful when querying `JSONField`. On PostgreSQL only, you can
use `GinIndex` that is better suited.

PostgreSQL users

PostgreSQL has two native JSON based data types: `json` and `jsonb`. The main
difference between them is how they are stored and how they can be queried.
PostgreSQL’s `json` field is stored as the original string representation of
the JSON and must be decoded on the fly when queried based on keys. The
`jsonb` field is stored based on the actual structure of the JSON which allows
indexing. The trade-off is a small additional cost on writing to the `jsonb`
field. `JSONField` uses `jsonb`.

Oracle users

Oracle Database does not support storing JSON scalar values. Only JSON objects
and arrays (represented in Python using `dict` and `list`) are supported.

### `PositiveBigIntegerField`

`class PositiveBigIntegerField(**options)`

Like a `PositiveIntegerField`, but only allows values under a certain
(database-dependent) point. Values from `0` to `9223372036854775807` are safe
in all databases supported by Django.

### `PositiveIntegerField`

`class PositiveIntegerField(**options)`

Like an `IntegerField`, but must be either positive or zero (`0`). Values from
`0` to `2147483647` are safe in all databases supported by Django. The value
`0` is accepted for backward compatibility reasons.

### `PositiveSmallIntegerField`

`class PositiveSmallIntegerField(**options)`

Like a `PositiveIntegerField`, but only allows values under a certain
(database-dependent) point. Values from `0` to `32767` are safe in all
databases supported by Django.

### `SlugField`

`class SlugField(max_length=50, **options)`

Slug is a newspaper term. A slug is a short label for something, containing
only letters, numbers, underscores or hyphens. They’re generally used in URLs.

Like a CharField, you can specify `max_length` (read the note about database
portability and `max_length` in that section, too). If `max_length` is not
specified, Django will use a default length of 50.

Implies setting `Field.db_index` to `True`.

It is often useful to automatically prepopulate a SlugField based on the value
of some other value. You can do this automatically in the admin using
`prepopulated_fields`.

It uses `validate_slug` or `validate_unicode_slug` for validation.

`SlugField.allow_unicode`

    
If `True`, the field accepts Unicode letters in addition to ASCII letters.
Defaults to `False`.

### `SmallAutoField`

`class SmallAutoField(**options)`

Like an `AutoField`, but only allows values under a certain (database-
dependent) limit. Values from `1` to `32767` are safe in all databases
supported by Django.

### `SmallIntegerField`

`class SmallIntegerField(**options)`

Like an `IntegerField`, but only allows values under a certain (database-
dependent) point. Values from `-32768` to `32767` are safe in all databases
supported by Django.

### `TextField`

`class TextField(**options)`

A large text field. The default form widget for this field is a `Textarea`.

If you specify a `max_length` attribute, it will be reflected in the
`Textarea` widget of the auto-generated form field. However it is not enforced
at the model or database level. Use a `CharField` for that.

`TextField.db_collation`

    
New in Django 3.2.

The database collation name of the field.

Note

Collation names are not standardized. As such, this will not be portable
across multiple database backends.

Oracle

Oracle does not support collations for a `TextField`.

### `TimeField`

`class TimeField(auto_now=False, auto_now_add=False, **options)`

A time, represented in Python by a `datetime.time` instance. Accepts the same
auto-population options as `DateField`.

The default form widget for this field is a `TimeInput`. The admin adds some
JavaScript shortcuts.

### `URLField`

`class URLField(max_length=200, **options)`

A `CharField` for a URL, validated by `URLValidator`.

The default form widget for this field is a `URLInput`.

Like all `CharField` subclasses, `URLField` takes the optional `max_length`
argument. If you don’t specify `max_length`, a default of 200 is used.

### `UUIDField`

`class UUIDField(**options)`

A field for storing universally unique identifiers. Uses Python’s `UUID`
class. When used on PostgreSQL, this stores in a `uuid` datatype, otherwise in
a `char(32)`.

Universally unique identifiers are a good alternative to `AutoField` for
`primary_key`. The database will not generate the UUID for you, so it is
recommended to use `default`:

    
    import uuid
    from django.db import models
    
    class MyUUIDModel(models.Model):
        id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False)
        # other fields
    
Note that a callable (with the parentheses omitted) is passed to `default`,
not an instance of `UUID`.

Lookups on PostgreSQL

Using `iexact`, `contains`, `icontains`, `startswith`, `istartswith`,
`endswith`, or `iendswith` lookups on PostgreSQL don’t work for values without
hyphens, because PostgreSQL stores them in a hyphenated uuid datatype type.

## Relationship fields

Django also defines a set of fields that represent relations.

### `ForeignKey`

`class ForeignKey(to, on_delete, **options)`

A many-to-one relationship. Requires two positional arguments: the class to
which the model is related and the `on_delete` option.

To create a recursive relationship – an object that has a many-to-one
relationship with itself – use `models.ForeignKey('self',
on_delete=models.CASCADE)`.

If you need to create a relationship on a model that has not yet been defined,
you can use the name of the model, rather than the model object itself:

    
    from django.db import models
    
    class Car(models.Model):
        manufacturer = models.ForeignKey(
            'Manufacturer',
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        )
        # ...
    
    class Manufacturer(models.Model):
        # ...
        pass
    
Relationships defined this way on abstract models are resolved when the model
is subclassed as a concrete model and are not relative to the abstract model’s
`app_label`:

products/models.py

    
    from django.db import models
    
    class AbstractCar(models.Model):
        manufacturer = models.ForeignKey('Manufacturer', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    
        class Meta:
            abstract = True
    
production/models.py

    
    from django.db import models
    from products.models import AbstractCar
    
    class Manufacturer(models.Model):
        pass
    
    class Car(AbstractCar):
        pass
    
    # Car.manufacturer will point to `production.Manufacturer` here.
    
To refer to models defined in another application, you can explicitly specify
a model with the full application label. For example, if the `Manufacturer`
model above is defined in another application called `production`, you’d need
to use:

    
    class Car(models.Model):
        manufacturer = models.ForeignKey(
            'production.Manufacturer',
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        )
    
This sort of reference, called a lazy relationship, can be useful when
resolving circular import dependencies between two applications.

A database index is automatically created on the `ForeignKey`. You can disable
this by setting `db_index` to `False`. You may want to avoid the overhead of
an index if you are creating a foreign key for consistency rather than joins,
or if you will be creating an alternative index like a partial or multiple
column index.

#### Database Representation

Behind the scenes, Django appends `"_id"` to the field name to create its
database column name. In the above example, the database table for the `Car`
model will have a `manufacturer_id` column. (You can change this explicitly by
specifying `db_column`) However, your code should never have to deal with the
database column name, unless you write custom SQL. You’ll always deal with the
field names of your model object.

#### Arguments

`ForeignKey` accepts other arguments that define the details of how the
relation works.

`ForeignKey.on_delete`

    
When an object referenced by a `ForeignKey` is deleted, Django will emulate
the behavior of the SQL constraint specified by the `on_delete` argument. For
example, if you have a nullable `ForeignKey` and you want it to be set null
when the referenced object is deleted:

    
    user = models.ForeignKey(
        User,
        models.SET_NULL,
        blank=True,
        null=True,
    )
    
`on_delete` doesn’t create an SQL constraint in the database. Support for
database-level cascade options may be implemented later.

The possible values for `on_delete` are found in `django.db.models`:

  * `CASCADE`
    
Cascade deletes. Django emulates the behavior of the SQL constraint ON DELETE
CASCADE and also deletes the object containing the ForeignKey.

`Model.delete()` isn’t called on related models, but the `pre_delete` and
`post_delete` signals are sent for all deleted objects.

  * `PROTECT`
    
Prevent deletion of the referenced object by raising `ProtectedError`, a
subclass of `django.db.IntegrityError`.

  * `RESTRICT`
    
Prevent deletion of the referenced object by raising `RestrictedError` (a
subclass of `django.db.IntegrityError`). Unlike `PROTECT`, deletion of the
referenced object is allowed if it also references a different object that is
being deleted in the same operation, but via a `CASCADE` relationship.

Consider this set of models:

        class Artist(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=10)
    
    class Album(models.Model):
        artist = models.ForeignKey(Artist, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    
    class Song(models.Model):
        artist = models.ForeignKey(Artist, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        album = models.ForeignKey(Album, on_delete=models.RESTRICT)
    
`Artist` can be deleted even if that implies deleting an `Album` which is
referenced by a `Song`, because `Song` also references `Artist` itself through
a cascading relationship. For example:

        >>> artist_one = Artist.objects.create(name='artist one')
    >>> artist_two = Artist.objects.create(name='artist two')
    >>> album_one = Album.objects.create(artist=artist_one)
    >>> album_two = Album.objects.create(artist=artist_two)
    >>> song_one = Song.objects.create(artist=artist_one, album=album_one)
    >>> song_two = Song.objects.create(artist=artist_one, album=album_two)
    >>> album_one.delete()
    # Raises RestrictedError.
    >>> artist_two.delete()
    # Raises RestrictedError.
    >>> artist_one.delete()
    (4, {'Song': 2, 'Album': 1, 'Artist': 1})
    
  * `SET_NULL`
    
Set the `ForeignKey` null; this is only possible if `null` is `True`.

  * `SET_DEFAULT`
    
Set the `ForeignKey` to its default value; a default for the `ForeignKey` must
be set.

  * `SET()`
    
Set the `ForeignKey` to the value passed to `SET()`, or if a callable is
passed in, the result of calling it. In most cases, passing a callable will be
necessary to avoid executing queries at the time your models.py is imported:

        from django.conf import settings
    from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
    from django.db import models
    
    def get_sentinel_user():
        return get_user_model().objects.get_or_create(username='deleted')[0]
    
    class MyModel(models.Model):
        user = models.ForeignKey(
            settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
            on_delete=models.SET(get_sentinel_user),
        )
    
  * `DO_NOTHING`
    
Take no action. If your database backend enforces referential integrity, this
will cause an `IntegrityError` unless you manually add an SQL `ON DELETE`
constraint to the database field.

`ForeignKey.limit_choices_to`

    
Sets a limit to the available choices for this field when this field is
rendered using a `ModelForm` or the admin (by default, all objects in the
queryset are available to choose). Either a dictionary, a `Q` object, or a
callable returning a dictionary or `Q` object can be used.

For example:

    
    staff_member = models.ForeignKey(
        User,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        limit_choices_to={'is_staff': True},
    )
    
causes the corresponding field on the `ModelForm` to list only `Users` that
have `is_staff=True`. This may be helpful in the Django admin.

The callable form can be helpful, for instance, when used in conjunction with
the Python `datetime` module to limit selections by date range. For example:

    
    def limit_pub_date_choices():
        return {'pub_date__lte': datetime.date.today()}
    
    limit_choices_to = limit_pub_date_choices
    
If `limit_choices_to` is or returns a `Q object`, which is useful for complex
queries, then it will only have an effect on the choices available in the
admin when the field is not listed in `raw_id_fields` in the `ModelAdmin` for
the model.

Note

If a callable is used for `limit_choices_to`, it will be invoked every time a
new form is instantiated. It may also be invoked when a model is validated,
for example by management commands or the admin. The admin constructs
querysets to validate its form inputs in various edge cases multiple times, so
there is a possibility your callable may be invoked several times.

`ForeignKey.related_name`

    
The name to use for the relation from the related object back to this one.
It’s also the default value for `related_query_name` (the name to use for the
reverse filter name from the target model). See the related objects
documentation for a full explanation and example. Note that you must set this
value when defining relations on abstract models; and when you do so some
special syntax is available.

If you’d prefer Django not to create a backwards relation, set `related_name`
to `'+'` or end it with `'+'`. For example, this will ensure that the `User`
model won’t have a backwards relation to this model:

    
    user = models.ForeignKey(
        User,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name='+',
    )
    
`ForeignKey.related_query_name`

    
The name to use for the reverse filter name from the target model. It defaults
to the value of `related_name` or `default_related_name` if set, otherwise it
defaults to the name of the model:

    
    # Declare the ForeignKey with related_query_name
    class Tag(models.Model):
        article = models.ForeignKey(
            Article,
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
            related_name="tags",
            related_query_name="tag",
        )
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    
    # That's now the name of the reverse filter
    Article.objects.filter(tag__name="important")
    
Like `related_name`, `related_query_name` supports app label and class
interpolation via some special syntax.

`ForeignKey.to_field`

    
The field on the related object that the relation is to. By default, Django
uses the primary key of the related object. If you reference a different
field, that field must have `unique=True`.

`ForeignKey.db_constraint`

    
Controls whether or not a constraint should be created in the database for
this foreign key. The default is `True`, and that’s almost certainly what you
want; setting this to `False` can be very bad for data integrity. That said,
here are some scenarios where you might want to do this:

  * You have legacy data that is not valid.
  * You’re sharding your database.

If this is set to `False`, accessing a related object that doesn’t exist will
raise its `DoesNotExist` exception.

`ForeignKey.swappable`

    
Controls the migration framework’s reaction if this `ForeignKey` is pointing
at a swappable model. If it is `True` \- the default - then if the
`ForeignKey` is pointing at a model which matches the current value of
`settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` (or another swappable model setting) the
relationship will be stored in the migration using a reference to the setting,
not to the model directly.

You only want to override this to be `False` if you are sure your model should
always point toward the swapped-in model - for example, if it is a profile
model designed specifically for your custom user model.

Setting it to `False` does not mean you can reference a swappable model even
if it is swapped out - `False` means that the migrations made with this
ForeignKey will always reference the exact model you specify (so it will fail
hard if the user tries to run with a User model you don’t support, for
example).

If in doubt, leave it to its default of `True`.

### `ManyToManyField`

`class ManyToManyField(to, **options)`

A many-to-many relationship. Requires a positional argument: the class to
which the model is related, which works exactly the same as it does for
`ForeignKey`, including recursive and lazy relationships.

Related objects can be added, removed, or created with the field’s
`RelatedManager`.

#### Database Representation

Behind the scenes, Django creates an intermediary join table to represent the
many-to-many relationship. By default, this table name is generated using the
name of the many-to-many field and the name of the table for the model that
contains it. Since some databases don’t support table names above a certain
length, these table names will be automatically truncated and a uniqueness
hash will be used, e.g. `author_books_9cdf`. You can manually provide the name
of the join table using the `db_table` option.

#### Arguments

`ManyToManyField` accepts an extra set of arguments – all optional – that
control how the relationship functions.

`ManyToManyField.related_name`

    
Same as `ForeignKey.related_name`.

`ManyToManyField.related_query_name`

    
Same as `ForeignKey.related_query_name`.

`ManyToManyField.limit_choices_to`

    
Same as `ForeignKey.limit_choices_to`.

`ManyToManyField.symmetrical`

    
Only used in the definition of ManyToManyFields on self. Consider the
following model:

    
    from django.db import models
    
    class Person(models.Model):
        friends = models.ManyToManyField("self")
    
When Django processes this model, it identifies that it has a
`ManyToManyField` on itself, and as a result, it doesn’t add a `person_set`
attribute to the `Person` class. Instead, the `ManyToManyField` is assumed to
be symmetrical – that is, if I am your friend, then you are my friend.

If you do not want symmetry in many-to-many relationships with `self`, set
`symmetrical` to `False`. This will force Django to add the descriptor for the
reverse relationship, allowing `ManyToManyField` relationships to be non-
symmetrical.

`ManyToManyField.through`

    
Django will automatically generate a table to manage many-to-many
relationships. However, if you want to manually specify the intermediary
table, you can use the `through` option to specify the Django model that
represents the intermediate table that you want to use.

The most common use for this option is when you want to associate extra data
with a many-to-many relationship.

Note

If you don’t want multiple associations between the same instances, add a
`UniqueConstraint` including the from and to fields. Django’s automatically
generated many-to-many tables include such a constraint.

Note

Recursive relationships using an intermediary model can’t determine the
reverse accessors names, as they would be the same. You need to set a
`related_name` to at least one of them. If you’d prefer Django not to create a
backwards relation, set `related_name` to `'+'`.

If you don’t specify an explicit `through` model, there is still an implicit
`through` model class you can use to directly access the table created to hold
the association. It has three fields to link the models.

If the source and target models differ, the following fields are generated:

  * `id`: the primary key of the relation.
  * `<containing_model>_id`: the `id` of the model that declares the `ManyToManyField`.
  * `<other_model>_id`: the `id` of the model that the `ManyToManyField` points to.

If the `ManyToManyField` points from and to the same model, the following
fields are generated:

  * `id`: the primary key of the relation.
  * `from_<model>_id`: the `id` of the instance which points at the model (i.e. the source instance).
  * `to_<model>_id`: the `id` of the instance to which the relationship points (i.e. the target model instance).

This class can be used to query associated records for a given model instance
like a normal model:

    
    Model.m2mfield.through.objects.all()
    
`ManyToManyField.through_fields`

    
Only used when a custom intermediary model is specified. Django will normally
determine which fields of the intermediary model to use in order to establish
a many-to-many relationship automatically. However, consider the following
models:

    
    from django.db import models
    
    class Person(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    
    class Group(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
        members = models.ManyToManyField(
            Person,
            through='Membership',
            through_fields=('group', 'person'),
        )
    
    class Membership(models.Model):
        group = models.ForeignKey(Group, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        person = models.ForeignKey(Person, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
        inviter = models.ForeignKey(
            Person,
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
            related_name="membership_invites",
        )
        invite_reason = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    
`Membership` has two foreign keys to `Person` (`person` and `inviter`), which
makes the relationship ambiguous and Django can’t know which one to use. In
this case, you must explicitly specify which foreign keys Django should use
using `through_fields`, as in the example above.

`through_fields` accepts a 2-tuple `('field1', 'field2')`, where `field1` is
the name of the foreign key to the model the `ManyToManyField` is defined on
(`group` in this case), and `field2` the name of the foreign key to the target
model (`person` in this case).

When you have more than one foreign key on an intermediary model to any (or
even both) of the models participating in a many-to-many relationship, you
must specify `through_fields`. This also applies to recursive relationships
when an intermediary model is used and there are more than two foreign keys to
the model, or you want to explicitly specify which two Django should use.

`ManyToManyField.db_table`

    
The name of the table to create for storing the many-to-many data. If this is
not provided, Django will assume a default name based upon the names of: the
table for the model defining the relationship and the name of the field
itself.

`ManyToManyField.db_constraint`

    
Controls whether or not constraints should be created in the database for the
foreign keys in the intermediary table. The default is `True`, and that’s
almost certainly what you want; setting this to `False` can be very bad for
data integrity. That said, here are some scenarios where you might want to do
this:

  * You have legacy data that is not valid.
  * You’re sharding your database.

It is an error to pass both `db_constraint` and `through`.

`ManyToManyField.swappable`

    
Controls the migration framework’s reaction if this `ManyToManyField` is
pointing at a swappable model. If it is `True` \- the default - then if the
`ManyToManyField` is pointing at a model which matches the current value of
`settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL` (or another swappable model setting) the
relationship will be stored in the migration using a reference to the setting,
not to the model directly.

You only want to override this to be `False` if you are sure your model should
always point toward the swapped-in model - for example, if it is a profile
model designed specifically for your custom user model.

If in doubt, leave it to its default of `True`.

`ManyToManyField` does not support `validators`.

`null` has no effect since there is no way to require a relationship at the
database level.

### `OneToOneField`

`class OneToOneField(to, on_delete, parent_link=False, **options)`

A one-to-one relationship. Conceptually, this is similar to a `ForeignKey`
with `unique=True`, but the “reverse” side of the relation will directly
return a single object.

This is most useful as the primary key of a model which “extends” another
model in some way; Multi-table inheritance is implemented by adding an
implicit one-to-one relation from the child model to the parent model, for
example.

One positional argument is required: the class to which the model will be
related. This works exactly the same as it does for `ForeignKey`, including
all the options regarding recursive and lazy relationships.

If you do not specify the `related_name` argument for the `OneToOneField`,
Django will use the lowercase name of the current model as default value.

With the following example:

    
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.db import models
    
    class MySpecialUser(models.Model):
        user = models.OneToOneField(
            settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        )
        supervisor = models.OneToOneField(
            settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
            on_delete=models.CASCADE,
            related_name='supervisor_of',
        )
    
your resulting `User` model will have the following attributes:

    
    >>> user = User.objects.get(pk=1)
    >>> hasattr(user, 'myspecialuser')
    True
    >>> hasattr(user, 'supervisor_of')
    True
    
A `RelatedObjectDoesNotExist` exception is raised when accessing the reverse
relationship if an entry in the related table doesn’t exist. This is a
subclass of the target model’s `Model.DoesNotExist` exception. For example, if
a user doesn’t have a supervisor designated by `MySpecialUser`:

    
    >>> user.supervisor_of
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    RelatedObjectDoesNotExist: User has no supervisor_of.
    
Additionally, `OneToOneField` accepts all of the extra arguments accepted by
`ForeignKey`, plus one extra argument:

`OneToOneField.parent_link`

    
When `True` and used in a model which inherits from another concrete model,
indicates that this field should be used as the link back to the parent class,
rather than the extra `OneToOneField` which would normally be implicitly
created by subclassing.

See One-to-one relationships for usage examples of `OneToOneField`.

## Field API reference

`class Field`

    
`Field` is an abstract class that represents a database table column. Django
uses fields to create the database table (`db_type()`), to map Python types to
database (`get_prep_value()`) and vice-versa (`from_db_value()`).

A field is thus a fundamental piece in different Django APIs, notably,
`models` and `querysets`.

In models, a field is instantiated as a class attribute and represents a
particular table column, see Models. It has attributes such as `null` and
`unique`, and methods that Django uses to map the field value to database-
specific values.

A `Field` is a subclass of `RegisterLookupMixin` and thus both `Transform` and
`Lookup` can be registered on it to be used in `QuerySet`s (e.g.
`field_name__exact="foo"`). All built-in lookups are registered by default.

All of Django’s built-in fields, such as `CharField`, are particular
implementations of `Field`. If you need a custom field, you can either
subclass any of the built-in fields or write a `Field` from scratch. In either
case, see How to create custom model fields.

`description`

    
A verbose description of the field, e.g. for the `django.contrib.admindocs`
application.

The description can be of the form:

    
    description = _("String (up to %(max_length)s)")
    
where the arguments are interpolated from the field’s `__dict__`.

`descriptor_class`

    
A class implementing the descriptor protocol that is instantiated and assigned
to the model instance attribute. The constructor must accept a single
argument, the `Field` instance. Overriding this class attribute allows for
customizing the get and set behavior.

To map a `Field` to a database-specific type, Django exposes several methods:

`get_internal_type()`

    
Returns a string naming this field for backend specific purposes. By default,
it returns the class name.

See Emulating built-in field types for usage in custom fields.

`db_type(connection)`

    
Returns the database column data type for the `Field`, taking into account the
`connection`.

See Custom database types for usage in custom fields.

`rel_db_type(connection)`

    
Returns the database column data type for fields such as `ForeignKey` and
`OneToOneField` that point to the `Field`, taking into account the
`connection`.

See Custom database types for usage in custom fields.

There are three main situations where Django needs to interact with the
database backend and fields:

  * when it queries the database (Python value -> database backend value)
  * when it loads data from the database (database backend value -> Python value)
  * when it saves to the database (Python value -> database backend value)

When querying, `get_db_prep_value()` and `get_prep_value()` are used:

`get_prep_value(value)`

    
`value` is the current value of the model’s attribute, and the method should
return data in a format that has been prepared for use as a parameter in a
query.

See Converting Python objects to query values for usage.

`get_db_prep_value(value, connection, prepared=False)`

    
Converts `value` to a backend-specific value. By default it returns `value` if
`prepared=True` and `get_prep_value()` if is `False`.

See Converting query values to database values for usage.

When loading data, `from_db_value()` is used:

`from_db_value(value, expression, connection)`

    
Converts a value as returned by the database to a Python object. It is the
reverse of `get_prep_value()`.

This method is not used for most built-in fields as the database backend
already returns the correct Python type, or the backend itself does the
conversion.

`expression` is the same as `self`.

See Converting values to Python objects for usage.

Note

For performance reasons, `from_db_value` is not implemented as a no-op on
fields which do not require it (all Django fields). Consequently you may not
call `super` in your definition.

When saving, `pre_save()` and `get_db_prep_save()` are used:

`get_db_prep_save(value, connection)`

    
Same as the `get_db_prep_value()`, but called when the field value must be
saved to the database. By default returns `get_db_prep_value()`.

`pre_save(model_instance, add)`

    
Method called prior to `get_db_prep_save()` to prepare the value before being
saved (e.g. for `DateField.auto_now`).

`model_instance` is the instance this field belongs to and `add` is whether
the instance is being saved to the database for the first time.

It should return the value of the appropriate attribute from `model_instance`
for this field. The attribute name is in `self.attname` (this is set up by
`Field`).

See Preprocessing values before saving for usage.

Fields often receive their values as a different type, either from
serialization or from forms.

`to_python(value)`

    
Converts the value into the correct Python object. It acts as the reverse of
`value_to_string()`, and is also called in `clean()`.

See Converting values to Python objects for usage.

Besides saving to the database, the field also needs to know how to serialize
its value:

`value_from_object(obj)`

    
Returns the field’s value for the given model instance.

This method is often used by `value_to_string()`.

`value_to_string(obj)`

    
Converts `obj` to a string. Used to serialize the value of the field.

See Converting field data for serialization for usage.

When using `model forms`, the `Field` needs to know which form field it should
be represented by:

`formfield(form_class=None, choices_form_class=None, **kwargs)`

    
Returns the default `django.forms.Field` of this field for `ModelForm`.

By default, if both `form_class` and `choices_form_class` are `None`, it uses
`CharField`. If the field has `choices` and `choices_form_class` isn’t
specified, it uses `TypedChoiceField`.

See Specifying the form field for a model field for usage.

`deconstruct()`

    
Returns a 4-tuple with enough information to recreate the field:

  1. The name of the field on the model.
  2. The import path of the field (e.g. `"django.db.models.IntegerField"`). This should be the most portable version, so less specific may be better.
  3. A list of positional arguments.
  4. A dict of keyword arguments.

This method must be added to fields prior to 1.7 to migrate its data using
Migrations.

# Field attribute reference

Every `Field` instance contains several attributes that allow introspecting
its behavior. Use these attributes instead of `isinstance` checks when you
need to write code that depends on a field’s functionality. These attributes
can be used together with the Model._meta API to narrow down a search for
specific field types. Custom model fields should implement these flags.

## Attributes for fields

`Field.auto_created`

    
Boolean flag that indicates if the field was automatically created, such as
the `OneToOneField` used by model inheritance.

`Field.concrete`

    
Boolean flag that indicates if the field has a database column associated with
it.

`Field.hidden`

    
Boolean flag that indicates if a field is used to back another non-hidden
field’s functionality (e.g. the `content_type` and `object_id` fields that
make up a `GenericForeignKey`). The `hidden` flag is used to distinguish what
constitutes the public subset of fields on the model from all the fields on
the model.

Note

`Options.get_fields()` excludes hidden fields by default. Pass in
`include_hidden=True` to return hidden fields in the results.

`Field.is_relation`

    
Boolean flag that indicates if a field contains references to one or more
other models for its functionality (e.g. `ForeignKey`, `ManyToManyField`,
`OneToOneField`, etc.).

`Field.model`

    
Returns the model on which the field is defined. If a field is defined on a
superclass of a model, `model` will refer to the superclass, not the class of
the instance.

## Attributes for fields with relations

These attributes are used to query for the cardinality and other details of a
relation. These attribute are present on all fields; however, they will only
have boolean values (rather than `None`) if the field is a relation type
(`Field.is_relation=True`).

`Field.many_to_many`

    
Boolean flag that is `True` if the field has a many-to-many relation; `False`
otherwise. The only field included with Django where this is `True` is
`ManyToManyField`.

`Field.many_to_one`

    
Boolean flag that is `True` if the field has a many-to-one relation, such as a
`ForeignKey`; `False` otherwise.

`Field.one_to_many`

    
Boolean flag that is `True` if the field has a one-to-many relation, such as a
`GenericRelation` or the reverse of a `ForeignKey`; `False` otherwise.

`Field.one_to_one`

    
Boolean flag that is `True` if the field has a one-to-one relation, such as a
`OneToOneField`; `False` otherwise.

`Field.related_model`

    
Points to the model the field relates to. For example, `Author` in
`ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)`. The `related_model` for a
`GenericForeignKey` is always `None`.
