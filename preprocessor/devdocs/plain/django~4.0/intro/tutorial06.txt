# Writing your first Django app, part 6

This tutorial begins where Tutorial 5 left off. We’ve built a tested web-poll
application, and we’ll now add a stylesheet and an image.

Aside from the HTML generated by the server, web applications generally need
to serve additional files — such as images, JavaScript, or CSS — necessary to
render the complete web page. In Django, we refer to these files as “static
files”.

For small projects, this isn’t a big deal, because you can keep the static
files somewhere your web server can find it. However, in bigger projects –
especially those comprised of multiple apps – dealing with the multiple sets
of static files provided by each application starts to get tricky.

That’s what `django.contrib.staticfiles` is for: it collects static files from
each of your applications (and any other places you specify) into a single
location that can easily be served in production.

Where to get help:

Getting Help section of the FAQ.

## Customize your app’s look and feel

First, create a directory called `static` in your `polls` directory. Django
will look for static files there, similarly to how Django finds templates
inside `polls/templates/`.

Django’s `STATICFILES_FINDERS` setting contains a list of finders that know
how to discover static files from various sources. One of the defaults is
`AppDirectoriesFinder` which looks for a “static” subdirectory in each of the
`INSTALLED_APPS`, like the one in `polls` we just created. The admin site uses
the same directory structure for its static files.

Within the `static` directory you have just created, create another directory
called `polls` and within that create a file called `style.css`. In other
words, your stylesheet should be at `polls/static/polls/style.css`. Because of
how the `AppDirectoriesFinder` staticfile finder works, you can refer to this
static file in Django as `polls/style.css`, similar to how you reference the
path for templates.

Static file namespacing

Just like templates, we might be able to get away with putting our static
files directly in `polls/static` (rather than creating another `polls`
subdirectory), but it would actually be a bad idea. Django will choose the
first static file it finds whose name matches, and if you had a static file
with the same name in a different application, Django would be unable to
distinguish between them. We need to be able to point Django at the right one,
and the best way to ensure this is by namespacing them. That is, by putting
those static files inside another directory named for the application itself.

Put the following code in that stylesheet (`polls/static/polls/style.css`):

polls/static/polls/style.css

    
    li a {
        color: green;
    }
    
Next, add the following at the top of `polls/templates/polls/index.html`:

polls/templates/polls/index.html

    
    {% load static %}
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'polls/style.css' %}">
    
The `{% static %}` template tag generates the absolute URL of static files.

That’s all you need to do for development.

Start the server (or restart it if it’s already running):

    
    $ python manage.py runserver
    
    
    ...\> py manage.py runserver
    
Reload `http://localhost:8000/polls/` and you should see that the question
links are green (Django style!) which means that your stylesheet was properly
loaded.

## Adding a background-image

Next, we’ll create a subdirectory for images. Create an `images` subdirectory
in the `polls/static/polls/` directory. Inside this directory, put an image
called `background.gif`. In other words, put your image in
`polls/static/polls/images/background.gif`.

Then, add to your stylesheet (`polls/static/polls/style.css`):

polls/static/polls/style.css

    
    body {
        background: white url("images/background.gif") no-repeat;
    }
    
Reload `http://localhost:8000/polls/` and you should see the background loaded
in the top left of the screen.

Warning

The `{% static %}` template tag is not available for use in static files which
aren’t generated by Django, like your stylesheet. You should always use
relative paths to link your static files between each other, because then you
can change `STATIC_URL` (used by the `static` template tag to generate its
URLs) without having to modify a bunch of paths in your static files as well.

These are the basics. For more details on settings and other bits included
with the framework see the static files howto and the staticfiles reference.
Deploying static files discusses how to use static files on a real server.

When you’re comfortable with the static files, read part 7 of this tutorial to
learn how to customize Django’s automatically-generated admin site.
