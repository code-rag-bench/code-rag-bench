# An introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn

Section contents

In this section, we introduce the machine learning vocabulary that we use
throughout scikit-learn and give a simple learning example.

## Machine learning: the problem setting

In general, a learning problem considers a set of n samples of data and then
tries to predict properties of unknown data. If each sample is more than a
single number and, for instance, a multi-dimensional entry (aka multivariate
data), it is said to have several attributes or features.

Learning problems fall into a few categories:

  * supervised learning, in which the data comes with additional attributes that we want to predict (Click here to go to the scikit-learn supervised learning page).This problem can be either:
    * classification: samples belong to two or more classes and we want to learn from already labeled data how to predict the class of unlabeled data. An example of a classification problem would be handwritten digit recognition, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a finite number of discrete categories. Another way to think of classification is as a discrete (as opposed to continuous) form of supervised learning where one has a limited number of categories and for each of the n samples provided, one is to try to label them with the correct category or class.
    * regression: if the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression. An example of a regression problem would be the prediction of the length of a salmon as a function of its age and weight.
  * unsupervised learning, in which the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization (Click here to go to the Scikit-Learn unsupervised learning page).

Training set and testing set

Machine learning is about learning some properties of a data set and then
testing those properties against another data set. A common practice in
machine learning is to evaluate an algorithm by splitting a data set into two.
We call one of those sets the training set, on which we learn some properties;
we call the other set the testing set, on which we test the learned
properties.

## Loading an example dataset

`scikit-learn` comes with a few standard datasets, for instance the iris and
digits datasets for classification and the diabetes dataset for regression.

In the following, we start a Python interpreter from our shell and then load
the `iris` and `digits` datasets. Our notational convention is that `$`
denotes the shell prompt while `>>>` denotes the Python interpreter prompt:

    
    $ python
    >>> from sklearn import datasets
    >>> iris = datasets.load_iris()
    >>> digits = datasets.load_digits()
    
A dataset is a dictionary-like object that holds all the data and some
metadata about the data. This data is stored in the `.data` member, which is a
`n_samples, n_features` array. In the case of supervised problem, one or more
response variables are stored in the `.target` member. More details on the
different datasets can be found in the dedicated section.

For instance, in the case of the digits dataset, `digits.data` gives access to
the features that can be used to classify the digits samples:

    
    >>> print(digits.data)
    [[ 0.   0.   5. ...   0.   0.   0.]
     [ 0.   0.   0. ...  10.   0.   0.]
     [ 0.   0.   0. ...  16.   9.   0.]
     ...
     [ 0.   0.   1. ...   6.   0.   0.]
     [ 0.   0.   2. ...  12.   0.   0.]
     [ 0.   0.  10. ...  12.   1.   0.]]
    
and `digits.target` gives the ground truth for the digit dataset, that is the
number corresponding to each digit image that we are trying to learn:

    
    >>> digits.target
    array([0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9, 8])
    
Shape of the data arrays

The data is always a 2D array, shape `(n_samples, n_features)`, although the
original data may have had a different shape. In the case of the digits, each
original sample is an image of shape `(8, 8)` and can be accessed using:

    
    >>> digits.images[0]
    array([[  0.,   0.,   5.,  13.,   9.,   1.,   0.,   0.],
           [  0.,   0.,  13.,  15.,  10.,  15.,   5.,   0.],
           [  0.,   3.,  15.,   2.,   0.,  11.,   8.,   0.],
           [  0.,   4.,  12.,   0.,   0.,   8.,   8.,   0.],
           [  0.,   5.,   8.,   0.,   0.,   9.,   8.,   0.],
           [  0.,   4.,  11.,   0.,   1.,  12.,   7.,   0.],
           [  0.,   2.,  14.,   5.,  10.,  12.,   0.,   0.],
           [  0.,   0.,   6.,  13.,  10.,   0.,   0.,   0.]])
    
The simple example on this dataset illustrates how starting from the original
problem one can shape the data for consumption in scikit-learn.

## Learning and predicting

In the case of the digits dataset, the task is to predict, given an image,
which digit it represents. We are given samples of each of the 10 possible
classes (the digits zero through nine) on which we fit an estimator to be able
to predict the classes to which unseen samples belong.

In scikit-learn, an estimator for classification is a Python object that
implements the methods `fit(X, y)` and `predict(T)`.

An example of an estimator is the class `sklearn.svm.SVC`, which implements
support vector classification. The estimator’s constructor takes as arguments
the model’s parameters.

For now, we will consider the estimator as a black box:

    
    >>> from sklearn import svm
    >>> clf = svm.SVC(gamma=0.001, C=100.)
    
Choosing the parameters of the model

In this example, we set the value of `gamma` manually. To find good values for
these parameters, we can use tools such as grid search and cross validation.

The `clf` (for classifier) estimator instance is first fitted to the model;
that is, it must learn from the model. This is done by passing our training
set to the `fit` method. For the training set, we’ll use all the images from
our dataset, except for the last image, which we’ll reserve for our
predicting. We select the training set with the `[:-1]` Python syntax, which
produces a new array that contains all but the last item from `digits.data`:

    
    >>> clf.fit(digits.data[:-1], digits.target[:-1])
    SVC(C=100.0, gamma=0.001)
    
Now you can predict new values. In this case, you’ll predict using the last
image from `digits.data`. By predicting, you’ll determine the image from the
training set that best matches the last image.

    
    >>> clf.predict(digits.data[-1:])
    array([8])
    
The corresponding image is:

As you can see, it is a challenging task: after all, the images are of poor
resolution. Do you agree with the classifier?

that you can run and study: Recognizing hand-written digits.

## Conventions

scikit-learn estimators follow certain rules to make their behavior more
predictive. These are described in more detail in the Glossary of Common Terms
and API Elements.

### Type casting

Unless otherwise specified, input will be cast to `float64`:

    
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn import random_projection
    
    >>> rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
    >>> X = rng.rand(10, 2000)
    >>> X = np.array(X, dtype='float32')
    >>> X.dtype
    dtype('float32')
    
    >>> transformer = random_projection.GaussianRandomProjection()
    >>> X_new = transformer.fit_transform(X)
    >>> X_new.dtype
    dtype('float64')
    
In this example, `X` is `float32`, which is cast to `float64` by
`fit_transform(X)`.

Regression targets are cast to `float64` and classification targets are
maintained:

    
    >>> from sklearn import datasets
    >>> from sklearn.svm import SVC
    >>> iris = datasets.load_iris()
    >>> clf = SVC()
    >>> clf.fit(iris.data, iris.target)
    SVC()
    
    >>> list(clf.predict(iris.data[:3]))
    [0, 0, 0]
    
    >>> clf.fit(iris.data, iris.target_names[iris.target])
    SVC()
    
    >>> list(clf.predict(iris.data[:3]))
    ['setosa', 'setosa', 'setosa']
    
Here, the first `predict()` returns an integer array, since `iris.target` (an
integer array) was used in `fit`. The second `predict()` returns a string
array, since `iris.target_names` was for fitting.

### Refitting and updating parameters

Hyper-parameters of an estimator can be updated after it has been constructed
via the set_params() method. Calling `fit()` more than once will overwrite
what was learned by any previous `fit()`:

    
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
    >>> from sklearn.svm import SVC
    >>> X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
    
    >>> clf = SVC()
    >>> clf.set_params(kernel='linear').fit(X, y)
    SVC(kernel='linear')
    >>> clf.predict(X[:5])
    array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
    
    >>> clf.set_params(kernel='rbf').fit(X, y)
    SVC()
    >>> clf.predict(X[:5])
    array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
    
Here, the default kernel `rbf` is first changed to `linear` via
`SVC.set_params()` after the estimator has been constructed, and changed back
to `rbf` to refit the estimator and to make a second prediction.

### Multiclass vs. multilabel fitting

When using `multiclass classifiers`, the learning and prediction task that is
performed is dependent on the format of the target data fit upon:

    
    >>> from sklearn.svm import SVC
    >>> from sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier
    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelBinarizer
    
    >>> X = [[1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 5], [3, 2], [3, 1]]
    >>> y = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
    
    >>> classif = OneVsRestClassifier(estimator=SVC(random_state=0))
    >>> classif.fit(X, y).predict(X)
    array([0, 0, 1, 1, 2])
    
In the above case, the classifier is fit on a 1d array of multiclass labels
and the `predict()` method therefore provides corresponding multiclass
predictions. It is also possible to fit upon a 2d array of binary label
indicators:

    
    >>> y = LabelBinarizer().fit_transform(y)
    >>> classif.fit(X, y).predict(X)
    array([[1, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 0],
           [0, 1, 0],
           [0, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0]])
    
Here, the classifier is `fit()` on a 2d binary label representation of `y`,
using the `LabelBinarizer`. In this case `predict()` returns a 2d array
representing the corresponding multilabel predictions.

Note that the fourth and fifth instances returned all zeroes, indicating that
they matched none of the three labels `fit` upon. With multilabel outputs, it
is similarly possible for an instance to be assigned multiple labels:

    
    >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import MultiLabelBinarizer
    >>> y = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [0, 2, 3], [2, 4]]
    >>> y = MultiLabelBinarizer().fit_transform(y)
    >>> classif.fit(X, y).predict(X)
    array([[1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]])
    
In this case, the classifier is fit upon instances each assigned multiple
labels. The `MultiLabelBinarizer` is used to binarize the 2d array of
multilabels to `fit` upon. As a result, `predict()` returns a 2d array with
multiple predicted labels for each instance.
