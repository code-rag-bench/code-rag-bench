# pandas.DataFrame.iterrows

DataFrame.iterrows()[source]

    
Iterate over DataFrame rows as (index, Series) pairs.

Yields

    
index:label or tuple of label

    
The index of the row. A tuple for a MultiIndex.

data:Series

    
The data of the row as a Series.

See also

`DataFrame.itertuples`

    
Iterate over DataFrame rows as namedtuples of the values.

`DataFrame.items`

    
Iterate over (column name, Series) pairs.

Notes

  1. Because `iterrows` returns a Series for each row, it does not preserve dtypes across the rows (dtypes are preserved across columns for DataFrames). For example,
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 1.5]], columns=['int', 'float'])
    >>> row = next(df.iterrows())[1]
    >>> row
    int      1.0
    float    1.5
    Name: 0, dtype: float64
    >>> print(row['int'].dtype)
    float64
    >>> print(df['int'].dtype)
    int64
    
To preserve dtypes while iterating over the rows, it is better to use
`itertuples()` which returns namedtuples of the values and which is generally
faster than `iterrows`.

  2. You should never modify something you are iterating over. This is not guaranteed to work in all cases. Depending on the data types, the iterator returns a copy and not a view, and writing to it will have no effect.
