# pandas.Series.copy

Series.copy(deep=True)[source]

    
Make a copy of this object’s indices and data.

When `deep=True` (default), a new object will be created with a copy of the
calling object’s data and indices. Modifications to the data or indices of the
copy will not be reflected in the original object (see notes below).

When `deep=False`, a new object will be created without copying the calling
object’s data or index (only references to the data and index are copied). Any
changes to the data of the original will be reflected in the shallow copy (and
vice versa).

Parameters

    
deep:bool, default True

    
Make a deep copy, including a copy of the data and the indices. With
`deep=False` neither the indices nor the data are copied.

Returns

    
copy:Series or DataFrame

    
Object type matches caller.

Notes

When `deep=True`, data is copied but actual Python objects will not be copied
recursively, only the reference to the object. This is in contrast to
copy.deepcopy in the Standard Library, which recursively copies object data
(see examples below).

While `Index` objects are copied when `deep=True`, the underlying numpy array
is not copied for performance reasons. Since `Index` is immutable, the
underlying data can be safely shared and a copy is not needed.

Examples

    
    >>> s = pd.Series([1, 2], index=["a", "b"])
    >>> s
    a    1
    b    2
    dtype: int64
    
    
    >>> s_copy = s.copy()
    >>> s_copy
    a    1
    b    2
    dtype: int64
    
Shallow copy versus default (deep) copy:

    
    >>> s = pd.Series([1, 2], index=["a", "b"])
    >>> deep = s.copy()
    >>> shallow = s.copy(deep=False)
    
Shallow copy shares data and index with original.

    
    >>> s is shallow
    False
    >>> s.values is shallow.values and s.index is shallow.index
    True
    
Deep copy has own copy of data and index.

    
    >>> s is deep
    False
    >>> s.values is deep.values or s.index is deep.index
    False
    
Updates to the data shared by shallow copy and original is reflected in both;
deep copy remains unchanged.

    
    >>> s[0] = 3
    >>> shallow[1] = 4
    >>> s
    a    3
    b    4
    dtype: int64
    >>> shallow
    a    3
    b    4
    dtype: int64
    >>> deep
    a    1
    b    2
    dtype: int64
    
Note that when copying an object containing Python objects, a deep copy will
copy the data, but will not do so recursively. Updating a nested data object
will be reflected in the deep copy.

    
    >>> s = pd.Series([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> deep = s.copy()
    >>> s[0][0] = 10
    >>> s
    0    [10, 2]
    1     [3, 4]
    dtype: object
    >>> deep
    0    [10, 2]
    1     [3, 4]
    dtype: object
