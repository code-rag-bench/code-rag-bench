# pandas.api.extensions.ExtensionArray.take

ExtensionArray.take(indices, *, allow_fill=False, fill_value=None)[source]

    
Take elements from an array.

Parameters

    
indices:sequence of int or one-dimensional np.ndarray of int

    
Indices to be taken.

allow_fill:bool, default False

    
How to handle negative values in indices.

  * False: negative values in indices indicate positional indices from the right (the default). This is similar to `numpy.take()`.
  * True: negative values in indices indicate missing values. These values are set to fill_value. Any other other negative values raise a `ValueError`.

fill_value:any, optional

    
Fill value to use for NA-indices when allow_fill is True. This may be `None`,
in which case the default NA value for the type, `self.dtype.na_value`, is
used.

For many ExtensionArrays, there will be two representations of fill_value: a
user-facing “boxed” scalar, and a low-level physical NA value. fill_value
should be the user-facing version, and the implementation should handle
translating that to the physical version for processing the take if necessary.

Returns

    
ExtensionArray

Raises

    
IndexError

    
When the indices are out of bounds for the array.

ValueError

    
When indices contains negative values other than `-1` and allow_fill is True.

Notes

ExtensionArray.take is called by `Series.__getitem__`, `.loc`, `iloc`, when
indices is a sequence of values. Additionally, it’s called by
`Series.reindex()`, or any other method that causes realignment, with a
fill_value.

Examples

Here’s an example implementation, which relies on casting the extension array
to object dtype. This uses the helper method `pandas.api.extensions.take()`.

    
    def take(self, indices, allow_fill=False, fill_value=None):
        from pandas.core.algorithms import take
    
        # If the ExtensionArray is backed by an ndarray, then
        # just pass that here instead of coercing to object.
        data = self.astype(object)
    
        if allow_fill and fill_value is None:
            fill_value = self.dtype.na_value
    
        # fill value should always be translated from the scalar
        # type for the array, to the physical storage type for
        # the data, before passing to take.
    
        result = take(data, indices, fill_value=fill_value,
                      allow_fill=allow_fill)
        return self._from_sequence(result, dtype=self.dtype)
