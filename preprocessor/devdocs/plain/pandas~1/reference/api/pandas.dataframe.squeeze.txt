# pandas.DataFrame.squeeze

DataFrame.squeeze(axis=None)[source]

    
Squeeze 1 dimensional axis objects into scalars.

Series or DataFrames with a single element are squeezed to a scalar.
DataFrames with a single column or a single row are squeezed to a Series.
Otherwise the object is unchanged.

This method is most useful when you don’t know if your object is a Series or
DataFrame, but you do know it has just a single column. In that case you can
safely call squeeze to ensure you have a Series.

Parameters

    
axis:{0 or ‘index’, 1 or ‘columns’, None}, default None

    
A specific axis to squeeze. By default, all length-1 axes are squeezed.

Returns

    
DataFrame, Series, or scalar

    
The projection after squeezing axis or all the axes.

Examples

    
    >>> primes = pd.Series([2, 3, 5, 7])
    
Slicing might produce a Series with a single value:

    
    >>> even_primes = primes[primes % 2 == 0]
    >>> even_primes
    0    2
    dtype: int64
    
    
    >>> even_primes.squeeze()
    2
    
Squeezing objects with more than one value in every axis does nothing:

    
    >>> odd_primes = primes[primes % 2 == 1]
    >>> odd_primes
    1    3
    2    5
    3    7
    dtype: int64
    
    
    >>> odd_primes.squeeze()
    1    3
    2    5
    3    7
    dtype: int64
    
Squeezing is even more effective when used with DataFrames.

    
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2], [3, 4]], columns=['a', 'b'])
    >>> df
       a  b
    0  1  2
    1  3  4
    
Slicing a single column will produce a DataFrame with the columns having only
one value:

    
    >>> df_a = df[['a']]
    >>> df_a
       a
    0  1
    1  3
    
So the columns can be squeezed down, resulting in a Series:

    
    >>> df_a.squeeze('columns')
    0    1
    1    3
    Name: a, dtype: int64
    
Slicing a single row from a single column will produce a single scalar
DataFrame:

    
    >>> df_0a = df.loc[df.index < 1, ['a']]
    >>> df_0a
       a
    0  1
    
Squeezing the rows produces a single scalar Series:

    
    >>> df_0a.squeeze('rows')
    a    1
    Name: 0, dtype: int64
    
Squeezing all axes will project directly into a scalar:

    
    >>> df_0a.squeeze()
    1
