# pandas.DataFrame.query

DataFrame.query(expr, inplace=False, **kwargs)[source]

    
Query the columns of a DataFrame with a boolean expression.

Parameters

    
expr:str

    
The query string to evaluate.

You can refer to variables in the environment by prefixing them with an ‘@’
character like `@a + b`.

You can refer to column names that are not valid Python variable names by
surrounding them in backticks. Thus, column names containing spaces or
punctuations (besides underscores) or starting with digits must be surrounded
by backticks. (For example, a column named “Area (cm^2)” would be referenced
as ``Area (cm^2)``). Column names which are Python keywords (like “list”,
“for”, “import”, etc) cannot be used.

For example, if one of your columns is called `a a` and you want to sum it
with `b`, your query should be ``a a` + b`.

New in version 0.25.0: Backtick quoting introduced.

New in version 1.0.0: Expanding functionality of backtick quoting for more
than only spaces.

inplace:bool

    
Whether the query should modify the data in place or return a modified copy.

**kwargs

    
See the documentation for `eval()` for complete details on the keyword
arguments accepted by `DataFrame.query()`.

Returns

    
DataFrame or None

    
DataFrame resulting from the provided query expression or None if
`inplace=True`.

`eval`

    
Evaluate a string describing operations on DataFrame columns.

`DataFrame.eval`

    
Evaluate a string describing operations on DataFrame columns.

Notes

The result of the evaluation of this expression is first passed to
`DataFrame.loc` and if that fails because of a multidimensional key (e.g., a
DataFrame) then the result will be passed to `DataFrame.__getitem__()`.

This method uses the top-level `eval()` function to evaluate the passed query.

The `query()` method uses a slightly modified Python syntax by default. For
example, the `&` and `|` (bitwise) operators have the precedence of their
boolean cousins, `and` and `or`. This is syntactically valid Python, however
the semantics are different.

You can change the semantics of the expression by passing the keyword argument
`parser='python'`. This enforces the same semantics as evaluation in Python
space. Likewise, you can pass `engine='python'` to evaluate an expression
using Python itself as a backend. This is not recommended as it is inefficient
compared to using `numexpr` as the engine.

The `DataFrame.index` and `DataFrame.columns` attributes of the `DataFrame`
instance are placed in the query namespace by default, which allows you to
treat both the index and columns of the frame as a column in the frame. The
identifier `index` is used for the frame index; you can also use the name of
the index to identify it in a query. Please note that Python keywords may not
be used as identifiers.

For further details and examples see the `query` documentation in indexing.

Backtick quoted variables

Backtick quoted variables are parsed as literal Python code and are converted
internally to a Python valid identifier. This can lead to the following
problems.

During parsing a number of disallowed characters inside the backtick quoted
string are replaced by strings that are allowed as a Python identifier. These
characters include all operators in Python, the space character, the question
mark, the exclamation mark, the dollar sign, and the euro sign. For other
characters that fall outside the ASCII range (U+0001..U+007F) and those that
are not further specified in PEP 3131, the query parser will raise an error.
This excludes whitespace different than the space character, but also the
hashtag (as it is used for comments) and the backtick itself (backtick can
also not be escaped).

In a special case, quotes that make a pair around a backtick can confuse the
parser. For example, ``it's` > `that's`` will raise an error, as it forms a
quoted string (`'s > `that'`) with a backtick inside.

(https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html) in combination
with the source code in `pandas.core.computation.parsing`.

Examples

    
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'A': range(1, 6),
    ...                    'B': range(10, 0, -2),
    ...                    'C C': range(10, 5, -1)})
    >>> df
       A   B  C C
    0  1  10   10
    1  2   8    9
    2  3   6    8
    3  4   4    7
    4  5   2    6
    >>> df.query('A > B')
       A  B  C C
    4  5  2    6
    
The previous expression is equivalent to

    
    >>> df[df.A > df.B]
       A  B  C C
    4  5  2    6
    
For columns with spaces in their name, you can use backtick quoting.

    
    >>> df.query('B == `C C`')
       A   B  C C
    0  1  10   10
    
The previous expression is equivalent to

    
    >>> df[df.B == df['C C']]
       A   B  C C
    0  1  10   10
