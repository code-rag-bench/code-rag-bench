# pandas.Series.duplicated

Series.duplicated(keep='first')[source]

    
Indicate duplicate Series values.

Duplicated values are indicated as `True` values in the resulting Series.
Either all duplicates, all except the first or all except the last occurrence
of duplicates can be indicated.

Parameters

    
keep:{‘first’, ‘last’, False}, default ‘first’

    
Method to handle dropping duplicates:

  * ‘first’ : Mark duplicates as `True` except for the first occurrence.
  * ‘last’ : Mark duplicates as `True` except for the last occurrence.
  * `False` : Mark all duplicates as `True`.

Returns

    
Series[bool]

    
Series indicating whether each value has occurred in the preceding values.

Examples

By default, for each set of duplicated values, the first occurrence is set on
False and all others on True:

    
    >>> animals = pd.Series(['lama', 'cow', 'lama', 'beetle', 'lama'])
    >>> animals.duplicated()
    0    False
    1    False
    2     True
    3    False
    4     True
    dtype: bool
    
which is equivalent to

    
    >>> animals.duplicated(keep='first')
    0    False
    1    False
    2     True
    3    False
    4     True
    dtype: bool
    
By using ‘last’, the last occurrence of each set of duplicated values is set
on False and all others on True:

    
    >>> animals.duplicated(keep='last')
    0     True
    1    False
    2     True
    3    False
    4    False
    dtype: bool
    
By setting keep on `False`, all duplicates are True:

    
    >>> animals.duplicated(keep=False)
    0     True
    1    False
    2     True
    3    False
    4     True
    dtype: bool
