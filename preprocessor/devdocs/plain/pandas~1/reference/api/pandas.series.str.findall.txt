# pandas.Series.str.findall

Series.str.findall(pat, flags=0)[source]

    
Find all occurrences of pattern or regular expression in the Series/Index.

Equivalent to applying `re.findall()` to all the elements in the Series/Index.

Parameters

    
pat:str

    
Pattern or regular expression.

flags:int, default 0

    
Flags from `re` module, e.g. re.IGNORECASE (default is 0, which means no
flags).

Returns

    
Series/Index of lists of strings

    
All non-overlapping matches of pattern or regular expression in each string of
this Series/Index.

See also

`count`

    
Count occurrences of pattern or regular expression in each string of the
Series/Index.

`extractall`

    
For each string in the Series, extract groups from all matches of regular
expression and return a DataFrame with one row for each match and one column
for each group.

`re.findall`

    
The equivalent `re` function to all non-overlapping matches of pattern or
regular expression in string, as a list of strings.

Examples

    
    >>> s = pd.Series(['Lion', 'Monkey', 'Rabbit'])
    
The search for the pattern ‘Monkey’ returns one match:

    
    >>> s.str.findall('Monkey')
    0          []
    1    [Monkey]
    2          []
    dtype: object
    
On the other hand, the search for the pattern ‘MONKEY’ doesn’t return any
match:

    
    >>> s.str.findall('MONKEY')
    0    []
    1    []
    2    []
    dtype: object
    
Flags can be added to the pattern or regular expression. For instance, to find
the pattern ‘MONKEY’ ignoring the case:

    
    >>> import re
    >>> s.str.findall('MONKEY', flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    0          []
    1    [Monkey]
    2          []
    dtype: object
    
When the pattern matches more than one string in the Series, all matches are
returned:

    
    >>> s.str.findall('on')
    0    [on]
    1    [on]
    2      []
    dtype: object
    
Regular expressions are supported too. For instance, the search for all the
strings ending with the word ‘on’ is shown next:

    
    >>> s.str.findall('on$')
    0    [on]
    1      []
    2      []
    dtype: object
    
If the pattern is found more than once in the same string, then a list of
multiple strings is returned:

    
    >>> s.str.findall('b')
    0        []
    1        []
    2    [b, b]
    dtype: object
