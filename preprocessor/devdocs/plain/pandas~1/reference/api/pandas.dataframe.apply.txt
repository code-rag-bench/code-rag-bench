# pandas.DataFrame.apply

DataFrame.apply(func, axis=0, raw=False, result_type=None, args=(),
**kwargs)[source]

    
Apply a function along an axis of the DataFrame.

Objects passed to the function are Series objects whose index is either the
DataFrame’s index (`axis=0`) or the DataFrame’s columns (`axis=1`). By default
(`result_type=None`), the final return type is inferred from the return type
of the applied function. Otherwise, it depends on the result_type argument.

Parameters

    
func:function

    
Function to apply to each column or row.

axis:{0 or ‘index’, 1 or ‘columns’}, default 0

    
Axis along which the function is applied:

  * 0 or ‘index’: apply function to each column.
  * 1 or ‘columns’: apply function to each row.

raw:bool, default False

    
Determines if row or column is passed as a Series or ndarray object:

  * `False` : passes each row or column as a Series to the function.
  * `True` : the passed function will receive ndarray objects instead. If you are just applying a NumPy reduction function this will achieve much better performance.

result_type:{‘expand’, ‘reduce’, ‘broadcast’, None}, default None

    
These only act when `axis=1` (columns):

  * ‘expand’ : list-like results will be turned into columns.
  * ‘reduce’ : returns a Series if possible rather than expanding list-like results. This is the opposite of ‘expand’.
  * ‘broadcast’ : results will be broadcast to the original shape of the DataFrame, the original index and columns will be retained.

The default behaviour (None) depends on the return value of the applied
function: list-like results will be returned as a Series of those. However if
the apply function returns a Series these are expanded to columns.

args:tuple

    
Positional arguments to pass to func in addition to the array/series.

**kwargs

    
Additional keyword arguments to pass as keywords arguments to func.

Returns

    
Series or DataFrame

    
Result of applying `func` along the given axis of the DataFrame.

`DataFrame.applymap`

    
For elementwise operations.

`DataFrame.aggregate`

    
Only perform aggregating type operations.

`DataFrame.transform`

    
Only perform transforming type operations.

Notes

Functions that mutate the passed object can produce unexpected behavior or
errors and are not supported. See Mutating with User Defined Function (UDF)
methods for more details.

Examples

    
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame([[4, 9]] * 3, columns=['A', 'B'])
    >>> df
       A  B
    0  4  9
    1  4  9
    2  4  9
    
Using a numpy universal function (in this case the same as `np.sqrt(df)`):

    
    >>> df.apply(np.sqrt)
         A    B
    0  2.0  3.0
    1  2.0  3.0
    2  2.0  3.0
    
Using a reducing function on either axis

    
    >>> df.apply(np.sum, axis=0)
    A    12
    B    27
    dtype: int64
    
    
    >>> df.apply(np.sum, axis=1)
    0    13
    1    13
    2    13
    dtype: int64
    
Returning a list-like will result in a Series

    
    >>> df.apply(lambda x: [1, 2], axis=1)
    0    [1, 2]
    1    [1, 2]
    2    [1, 2]
    dtype: object
    
Passing `result_type='expand'` will expand list-like results to columns of a
Dataframe

    
    >>> df.apply(lambda x: [1, 2], axis=1, result_type='expand')
       0  1
    0  1  2
    1  1  2
    2  1  2
    
Returning a Series inside the function is similar to passing
`result_type='expand'`. The resulting column names will be the Series index.

    
    >>> df.apply(lambda x: pd.Series([1, 2], index=['foo', 'bar']), axis=1)
       foo  bar
    0    1    2
    1    1    2
    2    1    2
    
Passing `result_type='broadcast'` will ensure the same shape result, whether
list-like or scalar is returned by the function, and broadcast it along the
axis. The resulting column names will be the originals.

    
    >>> df.apply(lambda x: [1, 2], axis=1, result_type='broadcast')
       A  B
    0  1  2
    1  1  2
    2  1  2
