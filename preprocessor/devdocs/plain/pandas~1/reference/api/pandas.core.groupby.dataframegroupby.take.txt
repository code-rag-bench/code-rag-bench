# pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.take

propertyDataFrameGroupBy.take

    
Return the elements in the given positional indices along an axis.

This means that we are not indexing according to actual values in the index
attribute of the object. We are indexing according to the actual position of
the element in the object.

Parameters

    
indices:array-like

    
An array of ints indicating which positions to take.

axis:{0 or ‘index’, 1 or ‘columns’, None}, default 0

    
The axis on which to select elements. `0` means that we are selecting rows,
`1` means that we are selecting columns.

is_copy:bool

    
Before pandas 1.0, `is_copy=False` can be specified to ensure that the return
value is an actual copy. Starting with pandas 1.0, `take` always returns a
copy, and the keyword is therefore deprecated.

Deprecated since version 1.0.0.

**kwargs

    
For compatibility with `numpy.take()`. Has no effect on the output.

Returns

    
taken:same type as caller

    
An array-like containing the elements taken from the object.

See also

`DataFrame.loc`

    
Select a subset of a DataFrame by labels.

`DataFrame.iloc`

    
Select a subset of a DataFrame by positions.

`numpy.take`

    
Take elements from an array along an axis.

Examples

    
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame([('falcon', 'bird', 389.0),
    ...                    ('parrot', 'bird', 24.0),
    ...                    ('lion', 'mammal', 80.5),
    ...                    ('monkey', 'mammal', np.nan)],
    ...                   columns=['name', 'class', 'max_speed'],
    ...                   index=[0, 2, 3, 1])
    >>> df
         name   class  max_speed
    0  falcon    bird      389.0
    2  parrot    bird       24.0
    3    lion  mammal       80.5
    1  monkey  mammal        NaN
    
Take elements at positions 0 and 3 along the axis 0 (default).

Note how the actual indices selected (0 and 1) do not correspond to our
selected indices 0 and 3. That’s because we are selecting the 0th and 3rd
rows, not rows whose indices equal 0 and 3.

    
    >>> df.take([0, 3])
         name   class  max_speed
    0  falcon    bird      389.0
    1  monkey  mammal        NaN
    
Take elements at indices 1 and 2 along the axis 1 (column selection).

    
    >>> df.take([1, 2], axis=1)
        class  max_speed
    0    bird      389.0
    2    bird       24.0
    3  mammal       80.5
    1  mammal        NaN
    
We may take elements using negative integers for positive indices, starting
from the end of the object, just like with Python lists.

    
    >>> df.take([-1, -2])
         name   class  max_speed
    1  monkey  mammal        NaN
    3    lion  mammal       80.5
