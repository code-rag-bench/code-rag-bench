# User Guide

The User Guide covers all of pandas by topic area. Each of the subsections
introduces a topic (such as “working with missing data”), and discusses how
pandas approaches the problem, with many examples throughout.

Users brand-new to pandas should start with 10 minutes to pandas.

For a high level summary of the pandas fundamentals, see Intro to data
structures and Essential basic functionality.

Further information on any specific method can be obtained in the API
reference.
