`tf.compat.v1.audio.decode_wav`

    
    tf.audio.decode_wav(
        contents, desired_channels=-1, desired_samples=-1, name=None
    )
    
The -32768 to 32767 signed 16-bit values will be scaled to -1.0 to 1.0 in
float.

When desired_channels is set, if the input contains fewer channels than this
then the last channel will be duplicated to give the requested number, else if
the input has more channels than requested then the additional channels will
be ignored.

If desired_samples is set, then the audio will be cropped or padded with
zeroes to the requested length.

The first output contains a Tensor with the content of the audio samples. The
lowest dimension will be the number of channels, and the second will be the
number of samples. For example, a ten-sample-long stereo WAV file should give
an output shape of [10, 2].

Args  
---  
`contents` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. The WAV-encoded audio, usually from a file.   
`desired_channels` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. Number of sample channels wanted.   
`desired_samples` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `-1`. Length of audio requested.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (audio, sample_rate).  
`audio` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`.   
`sample_rate` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`.
