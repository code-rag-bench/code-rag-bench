    tf.fingerprint(
        data, method='farmhash64', name=None
    )
    
Generates fingerprint values of `data`. Fingerprint op considers the first
dimension of `data` as the batch dimension, and `output[i]` contains the
fingerprint value generated from contents in `data[i, ...]` for all `i`.
Fingerprint op writes fingerprint values as byte arrays. For example, the
default method `farmhash64` generates a 64-bit fingerprint value at a time.
This 8-byte value is written out as an `tf.uint8` array of size 8, in little-
endian order. For example, suppose that `data` has data type `tf.int32` and
shape (2, 3, 4), and that the fingerprint method is `farmhash64`. In this
case, the output shape is (2, 8), where 2 is the batch dimension size of
`data`, and 8 is the size of each fingerprint value in bytes. `output[0, :]`
is generated from 12 integers in `data[0, :, :]` and similarly `output[1, :]`
is generated from other 12 integers in `data[1, :, :]`. Note that this op
fingerprints the raw underlying buffer, and it does not fingerprint Tensor's
metadata such as data type and/or shape. For example, the fingerprint values
are invariant under reshapes and bitcasts as long as the batch dimension
remain the same:

    
    tf.fingerprint(data) == tf.fingerprint(tf.reshape(data, ...))
    tf.fingerprint(data) == tf.fingerprint(tf.bitcast(data, ...))
    
For string data, one should expect `tf.fingerprint(data) != tf.fingerprint(tf.string.reduce_join(data))` in general. | Args  
---  
`data` |  A `Tensor`. Must have rank 1 or higher.   
`method` |  A `Tensor` of type `tf.string`. Fingerprint method used by this op. Currently available method is `farmhash64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A two-dimensional `Tensor` of type `tf.uint8`. The first dimension equals to
`data`'s first dimension, and the second dimension size depends on the
fingerprint algorithm.
