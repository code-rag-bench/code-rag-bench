`tf.compat.v1.CriticalSection`

    
    tf.CriticalSection(
        name=None, shared_name=None, critical_section_def=None, import_scope=None
    )
    
A `CriticalSection` object is a resource in the graph which executes subgraphs
in serial order. A common example of a subgraph one may wish to run
exclusively is the one given by the following function:

    
    v = resource_variable_ops.ResourceVariable(0.0, name="v")
    
    def count():
      value = v.read_value()
      with tf.control_dependencies([value]):
        with tf.control_dependencies([v.assign_add(1)]):
          return tf.identity(value)
    
Here, a snapshot of `v` is captured in `value`; and then `v` is updated. The
snapshot value is returned. If multiple workers or threads all execute `count`
in parallel, there is no guarantee that access to the variable `v` is atomic
at any point within any thread's calculation of `count`. In fact, even
implementing an atomic counter that guarantees that the user will see each
value `0, 1, ...,` is currently impossible. The solution is to ensure any
access to the underlying resource `v` is only processed through a critical
section:

    
    cs = CriticalSection()
    f1 = cs.execute(count)
    f2 = cs.execute(count)
    output = f1 + f2
    session.run(output)
    
The functions `f1` and `f2` will be executed serially, and updates to `v` will
be atomic. NOTES All resource objects, including the critical section and any
captured variables of functions executed on that critical section, will be
colocated to the same device (host and cpu/gpu). When using multiple critical
sections on the same resources, there is no guarantee of exclusive access to
those resources. This behavior is disallowed by default (but see the kwarg
`exclusive_resource_access`). For example, running the same function in two
separate critical sections will not ensure serial execution:

    
    v = tf.compat.v1.get_variable("v", initializer=0.0, use_resource=True)
    def accumulate(up):
      x = v.read_value()
      with tf.control_dependencies([x]):
        with tf.control_dependencies([v.assign_add(up)]):
          return tf.identity(x)
    ex1 = CriticalSection().execute(
      accumulate, 1.0, exclusive_resource_access=False)
    ex2 = CriticalSection().execute(
      accumulate, 1.0, exclusive_resource_access=False)
    bad_sum = ex1 + ex2
    sess.run(v.initializer)
    sess.run(bad_sum)  # May return 0.0

## Methods

### `execute`

View source

    
    execute(
        fn, exclusive_resource_access=True, name=None
    )
    
Execute function `fn()` inside the critical section.

`fn` should not accept any arguments. To add extra arguments to when calling
`fn` in the critical section, create a lambda:

    
    critical_section.execute(lambda: fn(*my_args, **my_kwargs))
    
Args  
---  
`fn` |  The function to execute. Must return at least one tensor.   
`exclusive_resource_access` |  Whether the resources required by `fn` should be exclusive to this `CriticalSection`. Default: `True`. You may want to set this to `False` if you will be accessing a resource in read-only mode in two different CriticalSections.   
`name` |  The name to use when creating the execute operation.   
Returns  
---  
The tensors returned from `fn()`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `fn` attempts to lock this `CriticalSection` in any nested or lazy way that may cause a deadlock.   
`ValueError` |  If `exclusive_resource_access == True` and another `CriticalSection` has an execution requesting the same resources as `fn``. Note, even if`exclusive_resource_access`is`True`, if another execution in another`CriticalSection`was created without`exclusive_resource_access=True`, a`ValueError` will be raised.
