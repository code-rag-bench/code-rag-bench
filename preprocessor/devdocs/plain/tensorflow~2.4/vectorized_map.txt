`tf.compat.v1.vectorized_map`

    
    tf.vectorized_map(
        fn, elems, fallback_to_while_loop=True
    )
    
This method works similar to `tf.map_fn` but is optimized to run much faster,
possibly with a much larger memory footprint. The speedups are obtained by
vectorization (see Auto-Vectorizing TensorFlow Graphs: Jacobians, Auto-
Batching and Beyond). The idea behind vectorization is to semantically launch
all the invocations of `fn` in parallel and fuse corresponding operations
across all these invocations. This fusion is done statically at graph
generation time and the generated code is often similar in performance to a
manually fused version. Because `tf.vectorized_map` fully parallelizes the
batch, this method will generally be significantly faster than using
`tf.map_fn`, especially in eager mode. However this is an experimental feature
and currently has a lot of limitations:

  * There should be no data dependency between the different semantic invocations of `fn`, i.e. it should be safe to map the elements of the inputs in any order.
  * Stateful kernels may mostly not be supported since these often imply a data dependency. We do support a limited set of such stateful kernels though (like RandomFoo, Variable operations like reads, etc).
  * `fn` has limited support for control flow operations.
  * `fn` should return nested structure of Tensors or Operations. However if an Operation is returned, it should have zero outputs.
  * The shape and dtype of any intermediate or output tensors in the computation of `fn` should not depend on the input to `fn`.

#### Examples:

    
    def outer_product(a):
      return tf.tensordot(a, a, 0)
    
    batch_size = 100
    a = tf.ones((batch_size, 32, 32))
    c = tf.vectorized_map(outer_product, a)
    assert c.shape == (batch_size, 32, 32, 32, 32)
    
    
    # Computing per-example gradients
    
    batch_size = 10
    num_features = 32
    layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    
    def model_fn(arg):
      with tf.GradientTape() as g:
        inp, label = arg
        inp = tf.expand_dims(inp, 0)
        label = tf.expand_dims(label, 0)
        prediction = layer(inp)
        loss = tf.nn.l2_loss(label - prediction)
      return g.gradient(loss, (layer.kernel, layer.bias))
    
    inputs = tf.random.uniform([batch_size, num_features])
    labels = tf.random.uniform([batch_size, 1])
    per_example_gradients = tf.vectorized_map(model_fn, (inputs, labels))
    assert per_example_gradients[0].shape == (batch_size, num_features, 1)
    assert per_example_gradients[1].shape == (batch_size, 1)
    
| Args  
---  
`fn` |  The callable to be performed. It accepts one argument, which will have the same (possibly nested) structure as `elems`, and returns a possibly nested structure of Tensors and Operations, which may be different than the structure of `elems`.   
`elems` |  A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors, each of which will be unpacked along their first dimension. The nested sequence of the resulting slices will be mapped over by `fn`. The first dimensions of all elements must broadcast to a consistent value; equivalently, each element tensor must have first dimension of either `B` or `1`, for some common batch size `B >= 1`.   
`fallback_to_while_loop` |  If true, on failing to vectorize an operation, the unsupported op is wrapped in a tf.while_loop to execute the map iterations. Note that this fallback only happens for unsupported ops and other parts of `fn` are still vectorized. If false, on encountering an unsupported op, a ValueError is thrown. Note that the fallbacks can result in slowdowns since vectorization often yields speedup of one to two orders of magnitude.   
Returns  
---  
A tensor or (possibly nested) sequence of tensors. Each tensor packs the
results of applying fn to tensors unpacked from elems along the first
dimension, from first to last. Although they are less common as user-visible
inputs and outputs, note that tensors of type `tf.variant` which represent
tensor lists (for example from `tf.raw_ops.TensorListFromTensor`) are
vectorized by stacking the list contents rather than the variant itself, and
so the container tensor will have a scalar shape when returned rather than the
usual stacked shape. This improves the performance of control flow gradient
vectorization.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If vectorization fails and fallback_to_while_loop is False.
