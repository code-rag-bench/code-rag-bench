`tf.compat.v1.errors.UnknownError`

    
    tf.errors.UnknownError(
        node_def, op, message, error_code=UNKNOWN
    )
    
An example of where this error may be returned is if a Status value received from another address space belongs to an error-space that is not known to this address space. Also, errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information may be converted to this error. | Attributes  
---  
`error_code` |  The integer error code that describes the error.   
`message` |  The error message that describes the error.   
`node_def` |  The `NodeDef` proto representing the op that failed.   
`op` |  The operation that failed, if known. 
> Note: If the failed op was synthesized at runtime, e.g. a `Send` or `Recv`
> op, there will be no corresponding `tf.Operation` object. In that case, this
> will return `None`, and you should instead use the
> `tf.errors.OpError.node_def` to discover information about the op.
