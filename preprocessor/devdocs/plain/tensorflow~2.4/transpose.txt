# tf.transpose

View source on GitHub  Transposes `a`, where `a` is a Tensor.

    
    tf.transpose(
        a, perm=None, conjugate=False, name='transpose'
    )
    
Permutes the dimensions according to the value of `perm`. The returned
tensor's dimension `i` will correspond to the input dimension `perm[i]`. If
`perm` is not given, it is set to (n-1...0), where n is the rank of the input
tensor. Hence by default, this operation performs a regular matrix transpose
on 2-D input Tensors. If conjugate is `True` and `a.dtype` is either
`complex64` or `complex128` then the values of `a` are conjugated and
transposed.

#### For example:

    
    x = tf.constant([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    tf.transpose(x)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(3, 2), dtype=int32, numpy=
    array([[1, 4],
           [2, 5],
           [3, 6]], dtype=int32)>
    
Equivalently, you could call `tf.transpose(x, perm=[1, 0])`. If `x` is
complex, setting conjugate=True gives the conjugate transpose:

    
    x = tf.constant([[1 + 1j, 2 + 2j, 3 + 3j],
                     [4 + 4j, 5 + 5j, 6 + 6j]])
    tf.transpose(x, conjugate=True)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(3, 2), dtype=complex128, numpy=
    array([[1.-1.j, 4.-4.j],
           [2.-2.j, 5.-5.j],
           [3.-3.j, 6.-6.j]])>
    
'perm' is more useful for n-dimensional tensors where n > 2:

    
    x = tf.constant([[[ 1,  2,  3],
                      [ 4,  5,  6]],
                     [[ 7,  8,  9],
                      [10, 11, 12]]])
    
As above, simply calling `tf.transpose` will default to `perm=[2,1,0]`. To
take the transpose of the matrices in dimension-0 (such as when you are
transposing matrices where 0 is the batch dimesnion), you would set
`perm=[0,2,1]`.

    
    tf.transpose(x, perm=[0, 2, 1])
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 3, 2), dtype=int32, numpy=
    array([[[ 1,  4],
            [ 2,  5],
            [ 3,  6]],
            [[ 7, 10],
            [ 8, 11],
            [ 9, 12]]], dtype=int32)>
    
> Note: This has a shorthand `linalg.matrix_transpose`):
| Args  
---  
`a` |  A `Tensor`.   
`perm` |  A permutation of the dimensions of `a`. This should be a vector.   
`conjugate` |  Optional bool. Setting it to `True` is mathematically equivalent to tf.math.conj(tf.transpose(input)).   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A transposed `Tensor`.  
#### Numpy Compatibility

In `numpy` transposes are memory-efficient constant time operations as they
simply return a new view of the same data with adjusted `strides`.

TensorFlow does not support strides, so `transpose` returns a new tensor with
the items permuted.
