`tf.compat.v1.estimator.PoissonRegressionHead`

    
    tf.estimator.PoissonRegressionHead(
        label_dimension=1, weight_column=None,
        loss_reduction=losses_utils.ReductionV2.SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE,
        compute_full_loss=True, name=None
    )
    
The loss is the weighted sum over all input dimensions. Namely, if the input
labels have shape `[batch_size, label_dimension]`, the loss is the weighted
sum over both `batch_size` and `label_dimension`. The head expects `logits`
with shape `[D0, D1, ... DN, label_dimension]`. In many applications, the
shape is `[batch_size, label_dimension]`. The `labels` shape must match
`logits`, namely `[D0, D1, ... DN, label_dimension]`. If `label_dimension=1`,
shape `[D0, D1, ... DN]` is also supported. If `weight_column` is specified,
weights must be of shape `[D0, D1, ... DN]`, `[D0, D1, ... DN, 1]` or `[D0,
D1, ... DN, label_dimension]`. This is implemented as a generalized linear
model, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model The head can
be used with a canned estimator. Example:

    
    my_head = tf.estimator.PoissonRegressionHead()
    my_estimator = tf.estimator.DNNEstimator(
        head=my_head,
        hidden_units=...,
        feature_columns=...)
    
It can also be used with a custom `model_fn`. Example:

    
    def _my_model_fn(features, labels, mode):
      my_head = tf.estimator.PoissonRegressionHead()
      logits = tf.keras.Model(...)(features)
    
      return my_head.create_estimator_spec(
          features=features,
          mode=mode,
          labels=labels,
          optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adagrad(lr=0.1),
          logits=logits)
    
    my_estimator = tf.estimator.Estimator(model_fn=_my_model_fn)
    
| Args  
---  
`weight_column` |  A string or a `NumericColumn` created by `tf.feature_column.numeric_column` defining feature column representing weights. It is used to down weight or boost examples during training. It will be multiplied by the loss of the example.   
`label_dimension` |  Number of regression labels per example. This is the size of the last dimension of the labels `Tensor` (typically, this has shape `[batch_size, label_dimension]`).   
`loss_reduction` |  One of `tf.losses.Reduction` except `NONE`. Decides how to reduce training loss over batch and label dimension. Defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`, namely weighted sum of losses divided by `batch size * label_dimension`.   
`compute_full_loss` |  Whether to include the constant `log(z!)` term in computing the poisson loss. See `tf.nn.log_poisson_loss` for the full documentation.   
`name` |  name of the head. If provided, summary and metrics keys will be suffixed by `"/" + name`. Also used as `name_scope` when creating ops.   
Attributes

`logits_dimension` |  See `base_head.Head` for details.   
`loss_reduction` |  See `base_head.Head` for details.

## Methods

### `create_estimator_spec`

View source

    
    create_estimator_spec(
        features, mode, logits, labels=None, optimizer=None, trainable_variables=None,
        train_op_fn=None, update_ops=None, regularization_losses=None
    )
    
Returns `EstimatorSpec` that a model_fn can return.

It is recommended to pass all args via name.

Args  
---  
`features` |  Input `dict` mapping string feature names to `Tensor` or `SparseTensor` objects containing the values for that feature in a minibatch. Often to be used to fetch example-weight tensor.   
`mode` |  Estimator's `ModeKeys`.   
`logits` |  Logits `Tensor` to be used by the head.   
`labels` |  Labels `Tensor`, or `dict` mapping string label names to `Tensor` objects of the label values.   
`optimizer` |  An `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` instance to optimize the loss in TRAIN mode. Namely, sets `train_op = optimizer.get_updates(loss, trainable_variables)`, which updates variables to minimize `loss`.   
`trainable_variables` |  A list or tuple of `Variable` objects to update to minimize `loss`. In Tensorflow 1.x, by default these are the list of variables collected in the graph under the key `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`. As Tensorflow 2.x doesn't have collections and GraphKeys, trainable_variables need to be passed explicitly here.   
`train_op_fn` |  Function that takes a scalar loss `Tensor` and returns an op to optimize the model with the loss in TRAIN mode. Used if `optimizer` is `None`. Exactly one of `train_op_fn` and `optimizer` must be set in TRAIN mode. By default, it is `None` in other modes. If you want to optimize loss yourself, you can pass `lambda _: tf.no_op()` and then use `EstimatorSpec.loss` to compute and apply gradients.   
`update_ops` |  A list or tuple of update ops to be run at training time. For example, layers such as BatchNormalization create mean and variance update ops that need to be run at training time. In Tensorflow 1.x, these are thrown into an UPDATE_OPS collection. As Tensorflow 2.x doesn't have collections, update_ops need to be passed explicitly here.   
`regularization_losses` |  A list of additional scalar losses to be added to the training loss, such as regularization losses.   
Returns  
---  
`EstimatorSpec`.
