    tf.estimator.BoostedTreesEstimator(
        feature_columns, n_batches_per_layer, head, model_dir=None, weight_column=None,
        n_trees=100, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.1, l1_regularization=0.0,
        l2_regularization=0.0, tree_complexity=0.0, min_node_weight=0.0, config=None,

    )
    
| Args  
---  
`feature_columns` |  An iterable containing all the feature columns used by the model. All items in the set should be instances of classes derived from `FeatureColumn`.   
`n_batches_per_layer` |  the number of batches to collect statistics per layer.   
`head` |  the `Head` instance defined for Estimator.   
`model_dir` |  Directory to save model parameters, graph and etc. This can also be used to load checkpoints from the directory into an estimator to continue training a previously saved model.   
`weight_column` |  A string or a `_NumericColumn` created by `tf.feature_column.numeric_column` defining feature column representing weights. It is used to downweight or boost examples during training. It will be multiplied by the loss of the example. If it is a string, it is used as a key to fetch weight tensor from the `features`. If it is a `_NumericColumn`, raw tensor is fetched by key `weight_column.key`, then weight_column.normalizer_fn is applied on it to get weight tensor.   
`n_trees` |  number trees to be created.   
`max_depth` |  maximum depth of the tree to grow.   
`learning_rate` |  shrinkage parameter to be used when a tree added to the model.   
`l1_regularization` |  regularization multiplier applied to the absolute weights of the tree leafs.   
`l2_regularization` |  regularization multiplier applied to the square weights of the tree leafs.   
`tree_complexity` |  regularization factor to penalize trees with more leaves.   
`min_node_weight` |  minimum hessian a node must have for a split to be considered. The value will be compared with `sum(leaf_hessian)/ (batch_size * n_batches_per_layer)`.   
`config` |  `RunConfig` object to configure the runtime settings.   
`center_bias` |  Whether bias centering needs to occur. Bias centering refers to the first node in the very first tree returning the prediction that is aligned with the original labels distribution. For example, for regression problems, the first node will return the mean of the labels. For binary classification problems, it will return a logit for a prior probability of label 1.   
`pruning_mode` |  one of `none`, `pre`, `post` to indicate no pruning, pre- pruning (do not split a node if not enough gain is observed) and post pruning (build the tree up to a max depth and then prune branches with negative gain). For pre and post pruning, you MUST provide `tree_complexity>0`.   
`quantile_sketch_epsilon` |  float between 0 and 1. Error bound for quantile computation. This is only used for float feature columns, and the number of buckets generated per float feature is `1/quantile_sketch_epsilon`.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  when wrong arguments are given or unsupported functionalities are requested.   
Attributes  
---  
`config` |   
`model_dir` |   
`model_fn` |  Returns the `model_fn` which is bound to `self.params`.

## Methods

### `eval_dir`

View source

    
    eval_dir(
        name=None
    )
    
Shows the directory name where evaluation metrics are dumped.

Args  
---  
`name` |  Name of the evaluation if user needs to run multiple evaluations on different data sets, such as on training data vs test data. Metrics for different evaluations are saved in separate folders, and appear separately in tensorboard.   
Returns  
---  
A string which is the path of directory contains evaluation metrics.  
### `evaluate`

View source

    
    evaluate(
        input_fn, steps=None, hooks=None, checkpoint_path=None, name=None
    )
    
Evaluates the model given evaluation data `input_fn`.

For each step, calls `input_fn`, which returns one batch of data. Evaluates
until:

  * `steps` batches are processed, or
  * `input_fn` raises an end-of-input exception (`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` or `StopIteration`).

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  A function that constructs the input data for evaluation. See Premade Estimators for more information. The function should construct and return one of the following: 
  * A `tf.data.Dataset` object: Outputs of `Dataset` object must be a tuple `(features, labels)` with same constraints as below.
  * A tuple `(features, labels)`: Where `features` is a `tf.Tensor` or a dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor` and `labels` is a `Tensor` or a dictionary of string label name to `Tensor`. Both `features` and `labels` are consumed by `model_fn`. They should satisfy the expectation of `model_fn` from inputs. 

  
`steps` |  Number of steps for which to evaluate model. If `None`, evaluates until `input_fn` raises an end-of-input exception.   
`hooks` |  List of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` subclass instances. Used for callbacks inside the evaluation call.   
`checkpoint_path` |  Path of a specific checkpoint to evaluate. If `None`, the latest checkpoint in `model_dir` is used. If there are no checkpoints in `model_dir`, evaluation is run with newly initialized `Variables` instead of ones restored from checkpoint.   
`name` |  Name of the evaluation if user needs to run multiple evaluations on different data sets, such as on training data vs test data. Metrics for different evaluations are saved in separate folders, and appear separately in tensorboard.   
Returns  
---  
A dict containing the evaluation metrics specified in `model_fn` keyed by
name, as well as an entry `global_step` which contains the value of the global
step for which this evaluation was performed. For canned estimators, the dict
contains the `loss` (mean loss per mini-batch) and the `average_loss` (mean
loss per sample). Canned classifiers also return the `accuracy`. Canned
regressors also return the `label/mean` and the `prediction/mean`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `steps <= 0`.   
### `experimental_export_all_saved_models`

View source

    
    experimental_export_all_saved_models(
        export_dir_base, input_receiver_fn_map, assets_extra=None, as_text=False,
        checkpoint_path=None
    )
    
Exports a `SavedModel` with `tf.MetaGraphDefs` for each requested mode.

For each mode passed in via the `input_receiver_fn_map`, this method builds a
new graph by calling the `input_receiver_fn` to obtain feature and label
`Tensor`s. Next, this method calls the `Estimator`'s `model_fn` in the passed
mode to generate the model graph based on those features and labels, and
restores the given checkpoint (or, lacking that, the most recent checkpoint)
into the graph. Only one of the modes is used for saving variables to the
`SavedModel` (order of preference: `tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN`,
`tf.estimator.ModeKeys.EVAL`, then `tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT`), such that
up to three `tf.MetaGraphDefs` are saved with a single set of variables in a
single `SavedModel` directory.

For the variables and `tf.MetaGraphDefs`, a timestamped export directory below
`export_dir_base`, and writes a `SavedModel` into it containing the
`tf.MetaGraphDef` for the given mode and its associated signatures.

For prediction, the exported `MetaGraphDef` will provide one `SignatureDef`
for each element of the `export_outputs` dict returned from the `model_fn`,
named using the same keys. One of these keys is always
`tf.saved_model.signature_constants.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY`,
indicating which signature will be served when a serving request does not
specify one. For each signature, the outputs are provided by the corresponding
`tf.estimator.export.ExportOutput`s, and the inputs are always the input
receivers provided by the `serving_input_receiver_fn`.

For training and evaluation, the `train_op` is stored in an extra collection,
and loss, metrics, and predictions are included in a `SignatureDef` for the
mode in question.

Extra assets may be written into the `SavedModel` via the `assets_extra`
argument. This should be a dict, where each key gives a destination path
(including the filename) relative to the assets.extra directory. The
corresponding value gives the full path of the source file to be copied. For
example, the simple case of copying a single file without renaming it is
specified as `{'my_asset_file.txt': '/path/to/my_asset_file.txt'}`.

Args  
---  
`export_dir_base` |  A string containing a directory in which to create timestamped subdirectories containing exported `SavedModel`s.   
`input_receiver_fn_map` |  dict of `tf.estimator.ModeKeys` to `input_receiver_fn` mappings, where the `input_receiver_fn` is a function that takes no arguments and returns the appropriate subclass of `InputReceiver`.   
`assets_extra` |  A dict specifying how to populate the assets.extra directory within the exported `SavedModel`, or `None` if no extra assets are needed.   
`as_text` |  whether to write the `SavedModel` proto in text format.   
`checkpoint_path` |  The checkpoint path to export. If `None` (the default), the most recent checkpoint found within the model directory is chosen.   
Returns  
---  
The path to the exported directory as a bytes object.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if any `input_receiver_fn` is `None`, no `export_outputs` are provided, or no checkpoint can be found.   
### `experimental_feature_importances`

View source

    
    experimental_feature_importances(
        normalize=False
    )
    
Computes gain-based feature importances.

The higher the value, the more important the corresponding feature.

Args  
---  
`normalize` |  If True, normalize the feature importances.   
Returns  
---  
`feature_importances` |  an OrderedDict, where the keys are the feature column names and the values are importances. It is sorted by importance.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  When attempting to normalize on an empty ensemble or an ensemble of trees which have no splits. Or when attempting to normalize and feature importances have negative values.   
### `experimental_predict_with_explanations`

View source

    
    experimental_predict_with_explanations(
        input_fn, predict_keys=None, hooks=None, checkpoint_path=None
    )
    
Computes model explainability outputs per example along with predictions.

Currently supports directional feature contributions (DFCs). For each
instance, DFCs indicate the aggregate contribution of each feature. See
https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1121 and http://blog.datadive.net/interpreting-
random-forests/ for more details.

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  A function that provides input data for predicting as minibatches. See Premade Estimators for more information. The function should construct and return one of the following: 
  * A `tf.data.Dataset` object: Outputs of `Dataset` object must be a tuple `(features, labels)` with same constraints as below.
  * A tuple `(features, labels)`: Where `features` is a `tf.Tensor` or a dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor` and `labels` is a `Tensor` or a dictionary of string label name to `Tensor`. Both `features` and `labels` are consumed by `model_fn`. They should satisfy the expectation of `model_fn` from inputs. 

  
`predict_keys` |  list of `str`, name of the keys to predict. It is used if the `tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec.predictions` is a `dict`. If `predict_keys` is used then rest of the predictions will be filtered from the dictionary, with the exception of 'bias' and 'dfc', which will always be in the dictionary. If `None`, returns all keys in prediction dict, as well as two new keys 'dfc' and 'bias'.   
`hooks` |  List of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` subclass instances. Used for callbacks inside the prediction call.   
`checkpoint_path` |  Path of a specific checkpoint to predict. If `None`, the latest checkpoint in `model_dir` is used. If there are no checkpoints in `model_dir`, prediction is run with newly initialized `Variables` instead of ones restored from checkpoint.   
Yields  
---  
Evaluated values of `predictions` tensors. The `predictions` tensors will
contain at least two keys 'dfc' and 'bias' for model explanations. The `dfc`
value corresponds to the contribution of each feature to the overall
prediction for this instance (positive indicating that the feature makes it
more likely to select class 1 and negative less likely). The `dfc` is an
OrderedDict, where the keys are the feature column names and the values are
the contributions. It is sorted by the absolute value of the contribution (e.g
OrderedDict([('age', -0.54), ('gender', 0.4), ('fare', 0.21)])). The 'bias'
value will be the same across all the instances, corresponding to the
probability (classification) or prediction (regression) of the training data
distribution.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  when wrong arguments are given or unsupported functionalities are requested.   
### `export_saved_model`

View source

    
    export_saved_model(
        export_dir_base, serving_input_receiver_fn, assets_extra=None, as_text=False,
        checkpoint_path=None, experimental_mode=ModeKeys.PREDICT
    )
    
Exports inference graph as a `SavedModel` into the given dir.

For a detailed guide, see SavedModel from Estimators.

This method builds a new graph by first calling the
`serving_input_receiver_fn` to obtain feature `Tensor`s, and then calling this
`Estimator`'s `model_fn` to generate the model graph based on those features.
It restores the given checkpoint (or, lacking that, the most recent
checkpoint) into this graph in a fresh session. Finally it creates a
timestamped export directory below the given `export_dir_base`, and writes a
`SavedModel` into it containing a single `tf.MetaGraphDef` saved from this
session.

The exported `MetaGraphDef` will provide one `SignatureDef` for each element
of the `export_outputs` dict returned from the `model_fn`, named using the
same keys. One of these keys is always
`tf.saved_model.signature_constants.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY`,
indicating which signature will be served when a serving request does not
specify one. For each signature, the outputs are provided by the corresponding
`tf.estimator.export.ExportOutput`s, and the inputs are always the input
receivers provided by the `serving_input_receiver_fn`.

Extra assets may be written into the `SavedModel` via the `assets_extra`
argument. This should be a dict, where each key gives a destination path
(including the filename) relative to the assets.extra directory. The
corresponding value gives the full path of the source file to be copied. For
example, the simple case of copying a single file without renaming it is
specified as `{'my_asset_file.txt': '/path/to/my_asset_file.txt'}`.

The experimental_mode parameter can be used to export a single
train/eval/predict graph as a `SavedModel`. See
`experimental_export_all_saved_models` for full docs.

Args  
---  
`export_dir_base` |  A string containing a directory in which to create timestamped subdirectories containing exported `SavedModel`s.   
`serving_input_receiver_fn` |  A function that takes no argument and returns a `tf.estimator.export.ServingInputReceiver` or `tf.estimator.export.TensorServingInputReceiver`.   
`assets_extra` |  A dict specifying how to populate the assets.extra directory within the exported `SavedModel`, or `None` if no extra assets are needed.   
`as_text` |  whether to write the `SavedModel` proto in text format.   
`checkpoint_path` |  The checkpoint path to export. If `None` (the default), the most recent checkpoint found within the model directory is chosen.   
`experimental_mode` |  `tf.estimator.ModeKeys` value indicating with mode will be exported. Note that this feature is experimental.   
Returns  
---  
The path to the exported directory as a bytes object.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if no `serving_input_receiver_fn` is provided, no `export_outputs` are provided, or no checkpoint can be found.

View source

    
    predict(
        input_fn, predict_keys=None, hooks=None, checkpoint_path=None,
        yield_single_examples=True
    )
    
Yields predictions for given features.

Please note that interleaving two predict outputs does not work. See:
issue/20506

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  A function that constructs the features. Prediction continues until `input_fn` raises an end-of-input exception (`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` or `StopIteration`). See Premade Estimators for more information. The function should construct and return one of the following: 
  * `tf.data.Dataset` object -- Outputs of `Dataset` object must have same constraints as below.
  * features -- A `tf.Tensor` or a dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor`. features are consumed by `model_fn`. They should satisfy the expectation of `model_fn` from inputs.
  * A tuple, in which case the first item is extracted as features. 

  
`predict_keys` |  list of `str`, name of the keys to predict. It is used if the `tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec.predictions` is a `dict`. If `predict_keys` is used then rest of the predictions will be filtered from the dictionary. If `None`, returns all.

`yield_single_examples` |  If `False`, yields the whole batch as returned by the `model_fn` instead of decomposing the batch into individual elements. This is useful if `model_fn` returns some tensors whose first dimension is not equal to the batch size.   
Yields  
---  
Evaluated values of `predictions` tensors.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If batch length of predictions is not the same and `yield_single_examples` is `True`.   
`ValueError` |  If there is a conflict between `predict_keys` and `predictions`. For example if `predict_keys` is not `None` but `tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec.predictions` is not a `dict`.   
### `train`

View source

    
    train(
        input_fn, hooks=None, steps=None, max_steps=None, saving_listeners=None
    )
    
Trains a model given training data `input_fn`.

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  A function that provides input data for training as minibatches. See Premade Estimators for more information. The function should construct and return one of the following: 
  * A `tf.data.Dataset` object: Outputs of `Dataset` object must be a tuple `(features, labels)` with same constraints as below.
  * A tuple `(features, labels)`: Where `features` is a `tf.Tensor` or a dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor` and `labels` is a `Tensor` or a dictionary of string label name to `Tensor`. Both `features` and `labels` are consumed by `model_fn`. They should satisfy the expectation of `model_fn` from inputs. 

  
`hooks` |  List of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` subclass instances. Used for callbacks inside the training loop.   
`steps` |  Number of steps for which to train the model. If `None`, train forever or train until `input_fn` generates the `tf.errors.OutOfRange` error or `StopIteration` exception. `steps` works incrementally. If you call two times `train(steps=10)` then training occurs in total 20 steps. If `OutOfRange` or `StopIteration` occurs in the middle, training stops before 20 steps. If you don't want to have incremental behavior please set `max_steps` instead. If set, `max_steps` must be `None`.   
`max_steps` |  Number of total steps for which to train model. If `None`, train forever or train until `input_fn` generates the `tf.errors.OutOfRange` error or `StopIteration` exception. If set, `steps` must be `None`. If `OutOfRange` or `StopIteration` occurs in the middle, training stops before `max_steps` steps. Two calls to `train(steps=100)` means 200 training iterations. On the other hand, two calls to `train(max_steps=100)` means that the second call will not do any iteration since first call did all 100 steps.   
`saving_listeners` |  list of `CheckpointSaverListener` objects. Used for callbacks that run immediately before or after checkpoint savings.   
Returns  
---  
`self`, for chaining.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If both `steps` and `max_steps` are not `None`.   
`ValueError` |  If either `steps` or `max_steps <= 0`.
