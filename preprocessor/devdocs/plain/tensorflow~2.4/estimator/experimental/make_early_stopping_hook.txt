`tf.compat.v1.estimator.experimental.make_early_stopping_hook`

    
    tf.estimator.experimental.make_early_stopping_hook(
        estimator, should_stop_fn, run_every_secs=60, run_every_steps=None
    )
    
Returns a `SessionRunHook` that stops training when `should_stop_fn` returns
`True`.

#### Usage example:

    
    estimator = ...
    hook = early_stopping.make_early_stopping_hook(
        estimator, should_stop_fn=make_stop_fn(...))
    train_spec = tf.estimator.TrainSpec(..., hooks=[hook])
    tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate(estimator, train_spec, ...)
    
Caveat: Current implementation supports early-stopping both training and evaluation in local mode. In distributed mode, training can be stopped but evaluation (where it's a separate job) will indefinitely wait for new model checkpoints to evaluate, so you will need other means to detect and stop it. Early-stopping evaluation in distributed mode requires changes in `train_and_evaluate` API and will be addressed in a future revision. | Args  
---  
`estimator` |  A `tf.estimator.Estimator` instance.   
`should_stop_fn` |  `callable`, function that takes no arguments and returns a `bool`. If the function returns `True`, stopping will be initiated by the chief.   
`run_every_secs` |  If specified, calls `should_stop_fn` at an interval of `run_every_secs` seconds. Defaults to 60 seconds. Either this or `run_every_steps` must be set.   
`run_every_steps` |  If specified, calls `should_stop_fn` every `run_every_steps` steps. Either this or `run_every_secs` must be set.   
Returns  
---  
A `SessionRunHook` that periodically executes `should_stop_fn` and initiates
early stopping if the function returns `True`.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `estimator` is not of type `tf.estimator.Estimator`.   
`ValueError` |  If both `run_every_secs` and `run_every_steps` are set.
