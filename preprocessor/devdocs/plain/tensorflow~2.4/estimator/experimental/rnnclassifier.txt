# tf.estimator.experimental.RNNClassifier

A classifier for TensorFlow RNN models.

Inherits From: `RNNEstimator`, `Estimator`

    
    tf.estimator.experimental.RNNClassifier(
        sequence_feature_columns, context_feature_columns=None, units=None,
        cell_type=USE_DEFAULT, rnn_cell_fn=None, return_sequences=False, model_dir=None,
        n_classes=2, weight_column=None, label_vocabulary=None,
        optimizer='Adagrad',
        loss_reduction=losses_utils.ReductionV2.SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE,
        sequence_mask='sequence_mask', config=None
    )
    
Trains a recurrent neural network model to classify instances into one of
multiple classes.

#### Example:

    
    token_sequence = sequence_categorical_column_with_hash_bucket(...)
    token_emb = embedding_column(categorical_column=token_sequence, ...)
    
    estimator = RNNClassifier(
        sequence_feature_columns=[token_emb],
        units=[32, 16], cell_type='lstm')
    
    # Input builders
    def input_fn_train: # returns x, y
      pass
    estimator.train(input_fn=input_fn_train, steps=100)
    
    def input_fn_eval: # returns x, y
      pass
    metrics = estimator.evaluate(input_fn=input_fn_eval, steps=10)
    def input_fn_predict: # returns x, None
      pass
    predictions = estimator.predict(input_fn=input_fn_predict)
    
Input of `train` and `evaluate` should have following features, otherwise
there will be a `KeyError`:

  * if `weight_column` is not `None`, a feature with `key=weight_column` whose value is a `Tensor`.
  * for each `column` in `sequence_feature_columns`: 
    * a feature with `key=column.name` whose `value` is a `SparseTensor`.
  * for each `column` in `context_feature_columns`: 
    * if `column` is a `CategoricalColumn`, a feature with `key=column.name` whose `value` is a `SparseTensor`.
    * if `column` is a `WeightedCategoricalColumn`, two features: the first with `key` the id column name, the second with `key` the weight column name. Both features' `value` must be a `SparseTensor`.
    * if `column` is a `DenseColumn`, a feature with `key=column.name` whose `value` is a `Tensor`.

Loss is calculated by using softmax cross entropy.

Args  
---  
`sequence_feature_columns` |  An iterable containing the `FeatureColumn`s that represent sequential input. All items in the set should either be sequence columns (e.g. `sequence_numeric_column`) or constructed from one (e.g. `embedding_column` with `sequence_categorical_column_*` as input).   
`context_feature_columns` |  An iterable containing the `FeatureColumn`s for contextual input. The data represented by these columns will be replicated and given to the RNN at each timestep. These columns must be instances of classes derived from `DenseColumn` such as `numeric_column`, not the sequential variants.   
`units` |  Iterable of integer number of hidden units per RNN layer. If set, `cell_type` must also be specified and `rnn_cell_fn` must be `None`.   
`cell_type` |  A class producing a RNN cell or a string specifying the cell type. Supported strings are: `'simple_rnn'`, `'lstm'`, and `'gru'`. If set, `units` must also be specified and `rnn_cell_fn` must be `None`.   
`rnn_cell_fn` |  A function that returns a RNN cell instance that will be used to construct the RNN. If set, `units` and `cell_type` cannot be set. This is for advanced users who need additional customization beyond `units` and `cell_type`. Note that `tf.keras.layers.StackedRNNCells` is needed for stacked RNNs.   
`return_sequences` |  A boolean indicating whether to return the last output in the output sequence, or the full sequence. Note that if True, `weight_column` must be None or a string.   
`model_dir` |  Directory to save model parameters, graph and etc. This can also be used to load checkpoints from the directory into a estimator to continue training a previously saved model.   
`n_classes` |  Number of label classes. Defaults to 2, namely binary classification. Must be > 1\.   
`weight_column` |  A string or a `NumericColumn` created by `tf.feature_column.numeric_column` defining feature column representing weights. It is used to down weight or boost examples during training. It will be multiplied by the loss of the example. If it is a string, it is used as a key to fetch weight tensor from the `features`. If it is a `NumericColumn`, raw tensor is fetched by key `weight_column.key`, then weight_column.normalizer_fn is applied on it to get weight tensor.   
`label_vocabulary` |  A list of strings represents possible label values. If given, labels must be string type and have any value in `label_vocabulary`. If it is not given, that means labels are already encoded as integer or float within [0, 1] for `n_classes=2` and encoded as integer values in {0, 1,..., n_classes-1} for `n_classes`>2 . Also there will be errors if vocabulary is not provided and labels are string.   
`optimizer` |  An instance of `tf.Optimizer` or string specifying optimizer type. Defaults to Adagrad optimizer.   
`loss_reduction` |  One of `tf.losses.Reduction` except `NONE`. Describes how to reduce training loss over batch. Defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`.   
`sequence_mask` |  A string with the name of the sequence mask tensor. If `sequence_mask` is in the features dictionary, the provided tensor is used, otherwise the sequence mask is computed from the length of sequential features. The sequence mask is used in evaluation and training mode to aggregate loss and metrics computation while excluding padding steps. It is also added to the predictions dictionary in prediction mode to indicate which steps are padding.   
`config` |  `RunConfig` object to configure the runtime settings.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `units`, `cell_type`, and `rnn_cell_fn` are not compatible.   
#### Eager Compatibility

Estimators are not compatible with eager execution.

Attributes

`model_dir` |   
`model_fn` |  Returns the `model_fn` which is bound to `self.params`.

## Methods

### `eval_dir`

View source

    
    eval_dir(
        name=None
    )
    
Shows the directory name where evaluation metrics are dumped.

Args  
---  
`name` |  Name of the evaluation if user needs to run multiple evaluations on different data sets, such as on training data vs test data. Metrics for different evaluations are saved in separate folders, and appear separately in tensorboard.   
Returns  
---  
A string which is the path of directory contains evaluation metrics.  
### `evaluate`

View source

    
    evaluate(
        input_fn, steps=None, hooks=None, checkpoint_path=None, name=None
    )
    
Evaluates the model given evaluation data `input_fn`.

For each step, calls `input_fn`, which returns one batch of data. Evaluates
until:

  * `steps` batches are processed, or
  * `input_fn` raises an end-of-input exception (`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` or `StopIteration`).

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  A function that constructs the input data for evaluation. See Premade Estimators for more information. The function should construct and return one of the following: 
  * A `tf.data.Dataset` object: Outputs of `Dataset` object must be a tuple `(features, labels)` with same constraints as below.
  * A tuple `(features, labels)`: Where `features` is a `tf.Tensor` or a dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor` and `labels` is a `Tensor` or a dictionary of string label name to `Tensor`. Both `features` and `labels` are consumed by `model_fn`. They should satisfy the expectation of `model_fn` from inputs. 

  
`steps` |  Number of steps for which to evaluate model. If `None`, evaluates until `input_fn` raises an end-of-input exception.   
`hooks` |  List of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` subclass instances. Used for callbacks inside the evaluation call.   
`checkpoint_path` |  Path of a specific checkpoint to evaluate. If `None`, the latest checkpoint in `model_dir` is used. If there are no checkpoints in `model_dir`, evaluation is run with newly initialized `Variables` instead of ones restored from checkpoint.   
`name` |  Name of the evaluation if user needs to run multiple evaluations on different data sets, such as on training data vs test data. Metrics for different evaluations are saved in separate folders, and appear separately in tensorboard.   
Returns  
---  
A dict containing the evaluation metrics specified in `model_fn` keyed by
name, as well as an entry `global_step` which contains the value of the global
step for which this evaluation was performed. For canned estimators, the dict
contains the `loss` (mean loss per mini-batch) and the `average_loss` (mean
loss per sample). Canned classifiers also return the `accuracy`. Canned
regressors also return the `label/mean` and the `prediction/mean`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `steps <= 0`.   
### `experimental_export_all_saved_models`

View source

    
    experimental_export_all_saved_models(
        export_dir_base, input_receiver_fn_map, assets_extra=None, as_text=False,
        checkpoint_path=None
    )
    
Exports a `SavedModel` with `tf.MetaGraphDefs` for each requested mode.

For each mode passed in via the `input_receiver_fn_map`, this method builds a
new graph by calling the `input_receiver_fn` to obtain feature and label
`Tensor`s. Next, this method calls the `Estimator`'s `model_fn` in the passed
mode to generate the model graph based on those features and labels, and
restores the given checkpoint (or, lacking that, the most recent checkpoint)
into the graph. Only one of the modes is used for saving variables to the
`SavedModel` (order of preference: `tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN`,
`tf.estimator.ModeKeys.EVAL`, then `tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT`), such that
up to three `tf.MetaGraphDefs` are saved with a single set of variables in a
single `SavedModel` directory.

For the variables and `tf.MetaGraphDefs`, a timestamped export directory below
`export_dir_base`, and writes a `SavedModel` into it containing the
`tf.MetaGraphDef` for the given mode and its associated signatures.

For prediction, the exported `MetaGraphDef` will provide one `SignatureDef`
for each element of the `export_outputs` dict returned from the `model_fn`,
named using the same keys. One of these keys is always
`tf.saved_model.signature_constants.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY`,
indicating which signature will be served when a serving request does not
specify one. For each signature, the outputs are provided by the corresponding
`tf.estimator.export.ExportOutput`s, and the inputs are always the input
receivers provided by the `serving_input_receiver_fn`.

For training and evaluation, the `train_op` is stored in an extra collection,
and loss, metrics, and predictions are included in a `SignatureDef` for the
mode in question.

Extra assets may be written into the `SavedModel` via the `assets_extra`
argument. This should be a dict, where each key gives a destination path
(including the filename) relative to the assets.extra directory. The
corresponding value gives the full path of the source file to be copied. For
example, the simple case of copying a single file without renaming it is
specified as `{'my_asset_file.txt': '/path/to/my_asset_file.txt'}`.

Args  
---  
`export_dir_base` |  A string containing a directory in which to create timestamped subdirectories containing exported `SavedModel`s.   
`input_receiver_fn_map` |  dict of `tf.estimator.ModeKeys` to `input_receiver_fn` mappings, where the `input_receiver_fn` is a function that takes no arguments and returns the appropriate subclass of `InputReceiver`.   
`assets_extra` |  A dict specifying how to populate the assets.extra directory within the exported `SavedModel`, or `None` if no extra assets are needed.   
`as_text` |  whether to write the `SavedModel` proto in text format.   
`checkpoint_path` |  The checkpoint path to export. If `None` (the default), the most recent checkpoint found within the model directory is chosen.   
Returns  
---  
The path to the exported directory as a bytes object.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if any `input_receiver_fn` is `None`, no `export_outputs` are provided, or no checkpoint can be found.   
### `export_saved_model`

View source

    
    export_saved_model(
        export_dir_base, serving_input_receiver_fn, assets_extra=None, as_text=False,
        checkpoint_path=None, experimental_mode=ModeKeys.PREDICT
    )
    
Exports inference graph as a `SavedModel` into the given dir.

For a detailed guide, see SavedModel from Estimators.

This method builds a new graph by first calling the
`serving_input_receiver_fn` to obtain feature `Tensor`s, and then calling this
`Estimator`'s `model_fn` to generate the model graph based on those features.
It restores the given checkpoint (or, lacking that, the most recent
checkpoint) into this graph in a fresh session. Finally it creates a
timestamped export directory below the given `export_dir_base`, and writes a
`SavedModel` into it containing a single `tf.MetaGraphDef` saved from this
session.

The exported `MetaGraphDef` will provide one `SignatureDef` for each element
of the `export_outputs` dict returned from the `model_fn`, named using the
same keys. One of these keys is always
`tf.saved_model.signature_constants.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY`,
indicating which signature will be served when a serving request does not
specify one. For each signature, the outputs are provided by the corresponding
`tf.estimator.export.ExportOutput`s, and the inputs are always the input
receivers provided by the `serving_input_receiver_fn`.

Extra assets may be written into the `SavedModel` via the `assets_extra`
argument. This should be a dict, where each key gives a destination path
(including the filename) relative to the assets.extra directory. The
corresponding value gives the full path of the source file to be copied. For
example, the simple case of copying a single file without renaming it is
specified as `{'my_asset_file.txt': '/path/to/my_asset_file.txt'}`.

The experimental_mode parameter can be used to export a single
train/eval/predict graph as a `SavedModel`. See
`experimental_export_all_saved_models` for full docs.

`as_text` |  whether to write the `SavedModel` proto in text format.   
`checkpoint_path` |  The checkpoint path to export. If `None` (the default), the most recent checkpoint found within the model directory is chosen.   
`experimental_mode` |  `tf.estimator.ModeKeys` value indicating with mode will be exported. Note that this feature is experimental.   
Returns  
---  
The path to the exported directory as a bytes object.  
Raises  
---

        yield_single_examples=True
    )
    
Yields predictions for given features.

Please note that interleaving two predict outputs does not work. See:
issue/20506

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  A function that constructs the features. Prediction continues until `input_fn` raises an end-of-input exception (`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` or `StopIteration`). See Premade Estimators for more information. The function should construct and return one of the following:

Yields  
---  
Evaluated values of `predictions` tensors.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If batch length of predictions is not the same and `yield_single_examples` is `True`.   
`ValueError` |  If there is a conflict between `predict_keys` and `predictions`. For example if `predict_keys` is not `None` but `tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec.predictions` is not a `dict`.   
### `train`

View source

    
    train(
        input_fn, hooks=None, steps=None, max_steps=None, saving_listeners=None
    )
    
Trains a model given training data `input_fn`.

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  A function that provides input data for training as minibatches. See Premade Estimators for more information. The function should construct and return one of the following: 
  * A `tf.data.Dataset` object: Outputs of `Dataset` object must be a tuple `(features, labels)` with same constraints as below.
  * A tuple `(features, labels)`: Where `features` is a `tf.Tensor` or a dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor` and `labels` is a `Tensor` or a dictionary of string label name to `Tensor`. Both `features` and `labels` are consumed by `model_fn`. They should satisfy the expectation of `model_fn` from inputs. 

  
`hooks` |  List of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` subclass instances. Used for callbacks inside the training loop.   
`steps` |  Number of steps for which to train the model. If `None`, train forever or train until `input_fn` generates the `tf.errors.OutOfRange` error or `StopIteration` exception. `steps` works incrementally. If you call two times `train(steps=10)` then training occurs in total 20 steps. If `OutOfRange` or `StopIteration` occurs in the middle, training stops before 20 steps. If you don't want to have incremental behavior please set `max_steps` instead. If set, `max_steps` must be `None`.   
`max_steps` |  Number of total steps for which to train model. If `None`, train forever or train until `input_fn` generates the `tf.errors.OutOfRange` error or `StopIteration` exception. If set, `steps` must be `None`. If `OutOfRange` or `StopIteration` occurs in the middle, training stops before `max_steps` steps. Two calls to `train(steps=100)` means 200 training iterations. On the other hand, two calls to `train(max_steps=100)` means that the second call will not do any iteration since first call did all 100 steps.   
`saving_listeners` |  list of `CheckpointSaverListener` objects. Used for callbacks that run immediately before or after checkpoint savings.   
Returns  
---  
`self`, for chaining.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If both `steps` and `max_steps` are not `None`.   
`ValueError` |  If either `steps` or `max_steps <= 0`.
