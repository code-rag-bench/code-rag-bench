    tf.data.experimental.dense_to_sparse_batch(
        batch_size, row_shape
    )
    
Like `Dataset.padded_batch()`, this transformation combines multiple
consecutive elements of the dataset, which might have different shapes, into a
single element. The resulting element has three components (`indices`,
`values`, and `dense_shape`), which comprise a `tf.sparse.SparseTensor` that
represents the same data. The `row_shape` represents the dense shape of each
row in the resulting `tf.sparse.SparseTensor`, to which the effective batch
size is prepended. For example:

    
    # NOTE: The following examples use `{ ... }` to represent the
    # contents of a dataset.
    a = { ['a', 'b', 'c'], ['a', 'b'], ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] }
    
    a.apply(tf.data.experimental.dense_to_sparse_batch(
        batch_size=2, row_shape=[6])) ==
    {
        ([[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 1]],  # indices
         ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b'],                 # values
         [2, 6]),                                   # dense_shape
        ([[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]],
         ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
         [1, 6])
    }
    
| Args  
---  
`batch_size` |  A `tf.int64` scalar `tf.Tensor`, representing the number of consecutive elements of this dataset to combine in a single batch.   
`row_shape` |  A `tf.TensorShape` or `tf.int64` vector tensor-like object representing the equivalent dense shape of a row in the resulting `tf.sparse.SparseTensor`. Each element of this dataset must have the same rank as `row_shape`, and must have size less than or equal to `row_shape` in each dimension.   
Returns  
---  
A `Dataset` transformation function, which can be passed to
`tf.data.Dataset.apply`.
