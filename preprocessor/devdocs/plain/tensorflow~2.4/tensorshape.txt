`tf.compat.v1.TensorShape`

    
    tf.TensorShape(
        dims
    )
    
A `TensorShape` represents a possibly-partial shape specification for a
`Tensor`. It may be one of the following:

  * Fully-known shape: has a known number of dimensions and a known size for each dimension. e.g. `TensorShape([16, 256])`
  * Partially-known shape: has a known number of dimensions, and an unknown size for one or more dimension. e.g. `TensorShape([None, 256])`
  * Unknown shape: has an unknown number of dimensions, and an unknown size in all dimensions. e.g. `TensorShape(None)`

If a tensor is produced by an operation of type `"Foo"`, its shape may be inferred if there is a registered shape function for `"Foo"`. See Shape functions for details of shape functions and how to register them. Alternatively, the shape may be set explicitly using `tf.Tensor.set_shape`. | Args  
---  
`dims` |  A list of Dimensions, or None if the shape is unspecified.   
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If dims cannot be converted to a list of dimensions.

This method can be used to assert that there exists a shape that both `self`
and `other` represent.

Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `self` and `other` do not represent the same shape.

View source

    
    assert_is_fully_defined()
    
Raises an exception if `self` is not fully defined in every dimension.

Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `self` does not have a known value for every dimension.   
### `assert_same_rank`

View source

    
    assert_same_rank(
        other
    )
    
Raises an exception if `self` and `other` do not have compatible ranks.

Args  
---  
`other` |  Another `TensorShape`.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `self` and `other` do not represent shapes with the same rank.   
### `concatenate`

View source

    
    concatenate(
        other
    )
    
Returns the concatenation of the dimension in `self` and `other`.

> Note: If either `self` or `other` is completely unknown, concatenation will
> discard information about the other shape. In future, we might support
> concatenation that preserves this information for use with slicing.
Args  
---  
`other` |  Another `TensorShape`.   
Returns  
---  
A `TensorShape` whose dimensions are the concatenation of the dimensions in
`self` and `other`.  
### `is_compatible_with`

View source

    
    is_compatible_with(
        other
    )
    
Returns True iff `self` is compatible with `other`.

Two possibly-partially-defined shapes are compatible if there exists a fully-
defined shape that both shapes can represent. Thus, compatibility allows the
shape inference code to reason about partially-defined shapes. For example:

  * TensorShape(None) is compatible with all shapes.
  * TensorShape([None, None]) is compatible with all two-dimensional shapes, such as TensorShape([32, 784]), and also TensorShape(None). It is not compatible with, for example, TensorShape([None]) or TensorShape([None, None, None]).
  * TensorShape([32, None]) is compatible with all two-dimensional shapes with size 32 in the 0th dimension, and also TensorShape([None, None]) and TensorShape(None). It is not compatible with, for example, TensorShape([32]), TensorShape([32, None, 1]) or TensorShape([64, None]).
  * TensorShape([32, 784]) is compatible with itself, and also TensorShape([32, None]), TensorShape([None, 784]), TensorShape([None, None]) and TensorShape(None). It is not compatible with, for example, TensorShape([32, 1, 784]) or TensorShape([None]).

The compatibility relation is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive. For
example, TensorShape([32, 784]) is compatible with TensorShape(None), and
TensorShape(None) is compatible with TensorShape([4, 4]), but TensorShape([32,
784]) is not compatible with TensorShape([4, 4]).

Args  
---  
`other` |  Another TensorShape.   
Returns  
---  
True iff `self` is compatible with `other`.

rules defined for `Dimension.merge_with()`.

---  
`other` |  Another `TensorShape`.
