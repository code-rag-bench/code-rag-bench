# tf.debugging.assert_rank_in

View source on GitHub  Assert that `x` has a rank in `ranks`.

    
    tf.debugging.assert_rank_in(
        x, ranks, message=None, name=None
    )
    
This Op checks that the rank of `x` is in `ranks`. If `x` has a different rank, `message`, as well as the shape of `x` are printed, and `InvalidArgumentError` is raised. | Args  
---  
`x` |  `Tensor`.   
`ranks` |  `Iterable` of scalar `Tensor` objects.   
`message` |  A string to prefix to the default message.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_rank_in".   
Returns  
---  
Op raising `InvalidArgumentError` unless rank of `x` is in `ranks`. If static
checks determine `x` has matching rank, a `no_op` is returned. This can be
used with `tf.control_dependencies` inside of `tf.function`s to block followup
computation until the check has executed.  
Raises  
---  
`InvalidArgumentError` |  `x` does not have rank in `ranks`, but the rank cannot be statically determined.   
`ValueError` |  If static checks determine `x` has mismatched rank.
