# tf.debugging.assert_near

View source on GitHub  Assert the condition `x` and `y` are close element-
wise.

    
    tf.debugging.assert_near(
        x, y, rtol=None, atol=None, message=None, summarize=None, name=None
    )
    
This Op checks that `x[i] - y[i] < atol + rtol * tf.abs(y[i])` holds for every pair of (possibly broadcast) elements of `x` and `y`. If both `x` and `y` are empty, this is trivially satisfied. If any elements of `x` and `y` are not close, `message`, as well as the first `summarize` entries of `x` and `y` are printed, and `InvalidArgumentError` is raised. The default `atol` and `rtol` is `10 * eps`, where `eps` is the smallest representable positive number such that `1 + eps != 1`. This is about `1.2e-6` in `32bit`, `2.22e-15` in `64bit`, and `0.00977` in `16bit`. See `numpy.finfo`. | Args  
---  
`x` |  Float or complex `Tensor`.   
`y` |  Float or complex `Tensor`, same dtype as and broadcastable to `x`.   
`rtol` |  `Tensor`. Same `dtype` as, and broadcastable to, `x`. The relative tolerance. Default is `10 * eps`.   
`atol` |  `Tensor`. Same `dtype` as, and broadcastable to, `x`. The absolute tolerance. Default is `10 * eps`.   
`message` |  A string to prefix to the default message.   
`summarize` |  Print this many entries of each tensor.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_near".   
Returns  
---  
Op that raises `InvalidArgumentError` if `x` and `y` are not close enough.
This can be used with `tf.control_dependencies` inside of `tf.function`s to
block followup computation until the check has executed.  
Raises  
---  
`InvalidArgumentError` |  if the check can be performed immediately and `x != y` is False for any pair of elements in `x` and `y`. The check can be performed immediately during eager execution or if `x` and `y` are statically known.   
#### Eager Compatibility

returns None

#### Numpy Compatibility

Similar to `numpy.testing.assert_allclose`, except tolerance depends on data
type. This is due to the fact that `TensorFlow` is often used with `32bit`,
`64bit`, and even `16bit` data.
