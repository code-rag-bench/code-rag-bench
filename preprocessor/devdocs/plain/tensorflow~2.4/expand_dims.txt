# tf.expand_dims

View source on GitHub  Returns a tensor with a length 1 axis inserted at index
`axis`.

    
    tf.expand_dims(
        input, axis, name=None
    )
    
Given a tensor `input`, this operation inserts a dimension of length 1 at the
dimension index `axis` of `input`'s shape. The dimension index follows Python
indexing rules: It's zero-based, a negative index it is counted backward from
the end. This operation is useful to:

  * Add an outer "batch" dimension to a single element.
  * Align axes for broadcasting.
  * To add an inner vector length axis to a tensor of scalars.

#### For example:

If you have a single image of shape `[height, width, channels]`:

    
    image = tf.zeros([10,10,3])
    
You can add an outer `batch` axis by passing `axis=0`:

    
    tf.expand_dims(image, axis=0).shape.as_list()
    [1, 10, 10, 3]
    
The new axis location matches Python `list.insert(axis, 1)`:

    
    tf.expand_dims(image, axis=1).shape.as_list()
    [10, 1, 10, 3]
    
Following standard Python indexing rules, a negative `axis` counts from the
end so `axis=-1` adds an inner most dimension:

    
    tf.expand_dims(image, -1).shape.as_list()
    [10, 10, 3, 1]
    
This operation requires that `axis` is a valid index for `input.shape`,
following Python indexing rules:

    
    -1-tf.rank(input) <= axis <= tf.rank(input)
    
This operation is related to:

  * `tf.squeeze`, which removes dimensions of size 1.
  * `tf.reshape`, which provides more flexible reshaping capability.
  * `tf.sparse.expand_dims`, which provides this functionality for `tf.SparseTensor`

| Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`.   
`axis` |  Integer specifying the dimension index at which to expand the shape of `input`. Given an input of D dimensions, `axis` must be in range `[-(D+1), D]` (inclusive).   
`name` |  Optional string. The name of the output `Tensor`.   
Returns  
---  
A tensor with the same data as `input`, with an additional dimension inserted
at the index specified by `axis`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `axis` is not specified.   
`InvalidArgumentError` |  If `axis` is out of range `[-(D+1), D]`.
