`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Fingerprint`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Fingerprint(
        data, method, name=None
    )
    
Generates fingerprint values of `data`.

Fingerprint op considers the first dimension of `data` as the batch dimension,
and `output[i]` contains the fingerprint value generated from contents in
`data[i, ...]` for all `i`.

Fingerprint op writes fingerprint values as byte arrays. For example, the
default method `farmhash64` generates a 64-bit fingerprint value at a time.
This 8-byte value is written out as an `uint8` array of size 8, in little-
endian order.

For example, suppose that `data` has data type `DT_INT32` and shape (2, 3, 4),
and that the fingerprint method is `farmhash64`. In this case, the output
shape is (2, 8), where 2 is the batch dimension size of `data`, and 8 is the
size of each fingerprint value in bytes. `output[0, :]` is generated from 12
integers in `data[0, :, :]` and similarly `output[1, :]` is generated from
other 12 integers in `data[1, :, :]`.

Note that this op fingerprints the raw underlying buffer, and it does not
fingerprint Tensor's metadata such as data type and/or shape. For example, the
fingerprint values are invariant under reshapes and bitcasts as long as the
batch dimension remain the same:

    
    Fingerprint(data) == Fingerprint(Reshape(data, ...))
    Fingerprint(data) == Fingerprint(Bitcast(data, ...))
    
For string data, one should expect `Fingerprint(data) !=
Fingerprint(ReduceJoin(data))` in general.

Args  
---  
`data` |  A `Tensor`. Must have rank 1 or higher.   
`method` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Fingerprint method used by this op. Currently available method is `farmhash::fingerprint64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `uint8`.
