`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.Dilation2D`

    
    tf.raw_ops.Dilation2D(
        input, filter, strides, rates, padding, name=None
    )
    
The `input` tensor has shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, depth]` and the
`filter` tensor has shape `[filter_height, filter_width, depth]`, i.e., each
input channel is processed independently of the others with its own
structuring function. The `output` tensor has shape `[batch, out_height,
out_width, depth]`. The spatial dimensions of the output tensor depend on the
`padding` algorithm. We currently only support the default "NHWC"
`data_format`.

In detail, the grayscale morphological 2-D dilation is the max-sum correlation
(for consistency with `conv2d`, we use unmirrored filters):

    
    output[b, y, x, c] =
       max_{dy, dx} input[b,
                          strides[1] * y + rates[1] * dy,
                          strides[2] * x + rates[2] * dx,
                          c] +
                    filter[dy, dx, c]
    
Max-pooling is a special case when the filter has size equal to the pooling
kernel size and contains all zeros.

Note on duality: The dilation of `input` by the `filter` is equal to the
negation of the erosion of `-input` by the reflected `filter`.

Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `int64`, `bfloat16`, `uint16`, `half`, `uint32`, `uint64`. 4-D with shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, depth]`.   
`filter` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `input`. 3-D with shape `[filter_height, filter_width, depth]`.   
`strides` |  A list of `ints` that has length `>= 4`. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of the input tensor. Must be: `[1, stride_height, stride_width, 1]`.   
`rates` |  A list of `ints` that has length `>= 4`. The input stride for atrous morphological dilation. Must be: `[1, rate_height, rate_width, 1]`.   
`padding` |  A `string` from: `"SAME", "VALID"`. The type of padding algorithm to use.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
