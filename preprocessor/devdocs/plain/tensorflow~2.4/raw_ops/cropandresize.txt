    tf.raw_ops.CropAndResize(
        image, boxes, box_ind, crop_size, method='bilinear',
        extrapolation_value=0, name=None
    )
    
Extracts crops from the input image tensor and resizes them using bilinear
sampling or nearest neighbor sampling (possibly with aspect ratio change) to a
common output size specified by `crop_size`. This is more general than the
`crop_to_bounding_box` op which extracts a fixed size slice from the input
image and does not allow resizing or aspect ratio change.

Returns a tensor with `crops` from the input `image` at positions defined at
the bounding box locations in `boxes`. The cropped boxes are all resized (with
bilinear or nearest neighbor interpolation) to a fixed `size = [crop_height,
crop_width]`. The result is a 4-D tensor `[num_boxes, crop_height, crop_width,
depth]`. The resizing is corner aligned. In particular, if `boxes = [[0, 0, 1,
1]]`, the method will give identical results to using
`tf.image.resize_bilinear()` or `tf.image.resize_nearest_neighbor()`(depends
on the `method` argument) with `align_corners=True`.

Args  
---  
`image` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `uint8`, `uint16`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `half`, `float32`, `float64`. A 4-D tensor of shape `[batch, image_height, image_width, depth]`. Both `image_height` and `image_width` need to be positive.   
`boxes` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A 2-D tensor of shape `[num_boxes, 4]`. The `i`-th row of the tensor specifies the coordinates of a box in the `box_ind[i]` image and is specified in normalized coordinates `[y1, x1, y2, x2]`. A normalized coordinate value of `y` is mapped to the image coordinate at `y * (image_height - 1)`, so as the `[0, 1]` interval of normalized image height is mapped to `[0, image_height - 1]` in image height coordinates. We do allow `y1` > `y2`, in which case the sampled crop is an up-down flipped version of the original image. The width dimension is treated similarly. Normalized coordinates outside the `[0, 1]` range are allowed, in which case we use `extrapolation_value` to extrapolate the input image values.   
`box_ind` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A 1-D tensor of shape `[num_boxes]` with int32 values in `[0, batch)`. The value of `box_ind[i]` specifies the image that the `i`-th box refers to.   
`crop_size` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32`. A 1-D tensor of 2 elements, `size = [crop_height, crop_width]`. All cropped image patches are resized to this size. The aspect ratio of the image content is not preserved. Both `crop_height` and `crop_width` need to be positive.   
`method` |  An optional `string` from: `"bilinear", "nearest"`. Defaults to `"bilinear"`. A string specifying the sampling method for resizing. It can be either `"bilinear"` or `"nearest"` and default to `"bilinear"`. Currently two sampling methods are supported: Bilinear and Nearest Neighbor.   
`extrapolation_value` |  An optional `float`. Defaults to `0`. Value used for extrapolation, when applicable.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns

A `Tensor` of type `float32`.
