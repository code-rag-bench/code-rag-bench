`tf.compat.v1.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxesV2`

    
    tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxesV2(
        images, boxes, colors, name=None
    )
    
Outputs a copy of `images` but draws on top of the pixels zero or more
bounding boxes specified by the locations in `boxes`. The coordinates of the
each bounding box in `boxes` are encoded as `[y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max]`.
The bounding box coordinates are floats in `[0.0, 1.0]` relative to the width
and height of the underlying image.

For example, if an image is 100 x 200 pixels (height x width) and the bounding
box is `[0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9]`, the upper-left and bottom-right coordinates of
the bounding box will be `(40, 10)` to `(100, 50)` (in (x,y) coordinates).

Parts of the bounding box may fall outside the image.

Args  
---  
`images` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `half`. 4-D with shape `[batch, height, width, depth]`. A batch of images.   
`boxes` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. 3-D with shape `[batch, num_bounding_boxes, 4]` containing bounding boxes.   
`colors` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. 2-D. A list of RGBA colors to cycle through for the boxes.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `images`.
