`tf.compat.v1.get_static_value`

    
    tf.get_static_value(
        tensor, partial=False
    )
    
This function attempts to partially evaluate the given tensor, and returns its value as a numpy ndarray if this succeeds. Compatibility(V1): If `constant_value(tensor)` returns a non-`None` result, it will no longer be possible to feed a different value for `tensor`. This allows the result of this function to influence the graph that is constructed, and permits static shape optimizations. | Args  
---  
`tensor` |  The Tensor to be evaluated.   
`partial` |  If True, the returned numpy array is allowed to have partially evaluated values. Values that can't be evaluated will be None.   
Returns  
---  
A numpy ndarray containing the constant value of the given `tensor`, or None
if it cannot be calculated.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  if tensor is not an ops.Tensor.
