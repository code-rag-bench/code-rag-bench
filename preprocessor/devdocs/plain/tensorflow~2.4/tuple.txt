# tf.tuple

View source on GitHub  Group tensors together.

    
    tf.tuple(
        tensors, control_inputs=None, name=None
    )
    
This creates a tuple of tensors with the same values as the `tensors` argument, except that the value of each tensor is only returned after the values of all tensors have been computed. `control_inputs` contains additional ops that have to finish before this op finishes, but whose outputs are not returned. This can be used as a "join" mechanism for parallel computations: all the argument tensors can be computed in parallel, but the values of any tensor returned by `tuple` are only available after all the parallel computations are done. See also `tf.group` and `tf.control_dependencies`. | Args  
---  
`tensors` |  A list of `Tensor`s or `IndexedSlices`, some entries can be `None`.   
`control_inputs` |  List of additional ops to finish before returning.   
`name` |  (optional) A name to use as a `name_scope` for the operation.   
Returns  
---  
Same as `tensors`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `tensors` does not contain any `Tensor` or `IndexedSlices`.   
`TypeError` |  If `control_inputs` is not a list of `Operation` or `Tensor` objects.
