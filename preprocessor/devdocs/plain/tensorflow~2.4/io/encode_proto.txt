`tf.compat.v1.io.encode_proto`

    
    tf.io.encode_proto(
        sizes, values, field_names, message_type,
        descriptor_source='local://', name=None
    )
    
The types of the tensors in `values` must match the schema for the fields
specified in `field_names`. All the tensors in `values` must have a common
shape prefix, batch_shape.

The `sizes` tensor specifies repeat counts for each field. The repeat count
(last dimension) of a each tensor in `values` must be greater than or equal to
corresponding repeat count in `sizes`.

A `message_type` name must be provided to give context for the field names.
The actual message descriptor can be looked up either in the linked-in
descriptor pool or a filename provided by the caller using the
`descriptor_source` attribute.

For the most part, the mapping between Proto field types and TensorFlow dtypes
is straightforward. However, there are a few special cases:

  * A proto field that contains a submessage or group can only be converted to `DT_STRING` (the serialized submessage). This is to reduce the complexity of the API. The resulting string can be used as input to another instance of the decode_proto op.
  * TensorFlow lacks support for unsigned integers. The ops represent uint64 types as a `DT_INT64` with the same twos-complement bit pattern (the obvious way). Unsigned int32 values can be represented exactly by specifying type `DT_INT64`, or using twos-complement if the caller specifies `DT_INT32` in the `output_types` attribute.

The `descriptor_source` attribute selects the source of protocol descriptors
to consult when looking up `message_type`. This may be:

  * An empty string or "local://", in which case protocol descriptors are created for C++ (not Python) proto definitions linked to the binary.
  * A file, in which case protocol descriptors are created from the file, which is expected to contain a `FileDescriptorSet` serialized as a string. NOTE: You can build a `descriptor_source` file using the `--descriptor_set_out` and `--include_imports` options to the protocol compiler `protoc`.
  * A "bytes://", in which protocol descriptors are created from `<bytes>`, which is expected to be a `FileDescriptorSet` serialized as a string.

`field_names` |  A list of `strings`. List of strings containing proto field names.   
`message_type` |  A `string`. Name of the proto message type to decode.   
`descriptor_source` |  An optional `string`. Defaults to `"local://"`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns
