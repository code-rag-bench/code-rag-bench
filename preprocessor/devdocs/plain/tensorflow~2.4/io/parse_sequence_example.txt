Parses a vector of serialized `SequenceExample` protos given in `serialized`. This op parses serialized sequence examples into a tuple of dictionaries, each mapping keys to `Tensor` and `SparseTensor` objects. The first dictionary contains mappings for keys appearing in `context_features`, and the second dictionary contains mappings for keys appearing in `sequence_features`. At least one of `context_features` and `sequence_features` must be provided and non-empty. The `context_features` keys are associated with a `SequenceExample` as a whole, independent of time / frame. In contrast, the `sequence_features` keys provide a way to access variable-length data within the `FeatureList` section of the `SequenceExample` proto. While the shapes of `context_features` values are fixed with respect to frame, the frame dimension (the first dimension) of `sequence_features` values may vary between `SequenceExample` protos, and even between `feature_list` keys within the same `SequenceExample`. `context_features` contains `VarLenFeature`, `RaggedFeature`, and `FixedLenFeature` objects. Each `VarLenFeature` is mapped to a `SparseTensor`; each `RaggedFeature` is mapped to a `RaggedTensor`; and each `FixedLenFeature` is mapped to a `Tensor`, of the specified type, shape, and default value. `sequence_features` contains `VarLenFeature`, `RaggedFeature`, and `FixedLenSequenceFeature` objects. Each `VarLenFeature` is mapped to a `SparseTensor`; each `RaggedFeature` is mapped to a `RaggedTensor; and each`FixedLenSequenceFeature`is mapped to a`Tensor`, each of the specified type. The shape will be`(B,T,) + df.dense_shape`for`FixedLenSequenceFeaturedf`, where`B`is the batch size, and`T`is the length of the associated`FeatureList`in the`SequenceExample`. For instance,`FixedLenSequenceFeature([])`yields a scalar 2-D`Tensor`of static shape`[None, None]`and dynamic shape`[B, T]`, while`FixedLenSequenceFeature([k])`(for`int k >= 1`) yields a 3-D matrix`Tensor`of static shape`[None, None, k]`and dynamic shape`[B, T, k]`. Like the input, the resulting output tensors have a batch dimension. This means that the original per-example shapes of `VarLenFeature`s and `FixedLenSequenceFeature`s can be lost. To handle that situation, this op also provides dicts of shape tensors as part of the output. There is one dict for the context features, and one for the feature_list features. Context features of type `FixedLenFeature`s will not be present, since their shapes are already known by the caller. In situations where the input 'FixedLenFeature`s are of different lengths across examples, the shorter examples will be padded with default datatype values: 0 for numeric types, and the empty string for string types. Each `SparseTensor` corresponding to `sequence_features` represents a ragged vector. Its indices are `[time, index]`, where `time` is the `FeatureList` entry and `index` is the value's index in the list of values associated with that time. `FixedLenFeature` entries with a `default_value` and `FixedLenSequenceFeature` entries with `allow_missing=True` are optional; otherwise, we will fail if that `Feature` or `FeatureList` is missing from any example in `serialized`. `example_name` may contain a descriptive name for the corresponding serialized proto. This may be useful for debugging purposes, but it has no effect on the output. If not `None`, `example_name` must be a scalar. | Args  
---  
`serialized` |  A vector (1-D Tensor) of type string containing binary serialized `SequenceExample` protos.   
`context_features` |  A `dict` mapping feature keys to `FixedLenFeature` or `VarLenFeature` or `RaggedFeature` values. These features are associated with a `SequenceExample` as a whole.   
`sequence_features` |  A `dict` mapping feature keys to `FixedLenSequenceFeature` or `VarLenFeature` or `RaggedFeature` values. These features are associated with data within the `FeatureList` section of the `SequenceExample` proto.   
`example_names` |  A vector (1-D Tensor) of strings (optional), the name of the serialized protos.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of three `dict`s, each mapping keys to `Tensor`s, `SparseTensor`s, and
`RaggedTensor`. The first dict contains the context key/values, the second
dict contains the feature_list key/values, and the final dict contains the
lengths of any dense feature_list features.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if any feature is invalid.
