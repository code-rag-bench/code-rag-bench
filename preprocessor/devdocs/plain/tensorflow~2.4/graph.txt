`tf.compat.v1.Graph`

    
    tf.Graph()
    
Graphs are used by `tf.function`s to represent the function's computations.
Each graph contains a set of `tf.Operation` objects, which represent units of
computation; and `tf.Tensor` objects, which represent the units of data that
flow between operations.

### Using graphs directly (deprecated)

A `tf.Graph` can be constructed and used directly without a `tf.function`, as
was required in TensorFlow 1, but this is deprecated and it is recommended to
use a `tf.function` instead. If a graph is directly used, other deprecated
TensorFlow 1 classes are also required to execute the graph, such as a
`tf.compat.v1.Session`. A default graph can be registered with the
`tf.Graph.as_default` context manager. Then, operations will be added to the
graph instead of being executed eagerly. For example:

    
    g = tf.Graph()
    with g.as_default():
      # Define operations and tensors in `g`.
      c = tf.constant(30.0)
      assert c.graph is g
    
`tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph()` can be used to obtain the default graph. Important note: This class is not thread-safe for graph construction. All operations should be created from a single thread, or external synchronization must be provided. Unless otherwise specified, all methods are not thread-safe. A `Graph` instance supports an arbitrary number of "collections" that are identified by name. For convenience when building a large graph, collections can store groups of related objects: for example, the `tf.Variable` uses a collection (named `tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES`) for all variables that are created during the construction of a graph. The caller may define additional collections by specifying a new name. | Attributes  
---  
`building_function` |  Returns True iff this graph represents a function.   
`collections` |  Returns the names of the collections known to this graph.   
`finalized` |  True if this graph has been finalized.   
`graph_def_versions` |  The GraphDef version information of this graph. For details on the meaning of each version, see `GraphDef`.   
`seed` |  The graph-level random seed of this graph.   
`version` |  Returns a version number that increases as ops are added to the graph. Note that this is unrelated to the `tf.Graph.graph_def_versions`.   
## Methods

### `add_to_collection`

View source

    
    add_to_collection(
        name, value
    )
    
Stores `value` in the collection with the given `name`.

Note that collections are not sets, so it is possible to add a value to a
collection several times.

Args  
---  
`name` |  The key for the collection. The `GraphKeys` class contains many standard names for collections.   
`value` |  The value to add to the collection.   
### `add_to_collections`

View source

    
    add_to_collections(
        names, value
    )
    
Stores `value` in the collections given by `names`.

Note that collections are not sets, so it is possible to add a value to a
collection several times. This function makes sure that duplicates in `names`
are ignored, but it will not check for pre-existing membership of `value` in
any of the collections in `names`.

`names` can be any iterable, but if `names` is a string, it is treated as a
single collection name.

Args  
---  
`names` |  The keys for the collections to add to. The `GraphKeys` class contains many standard names for collections.   
`value` |  The value to add to the collections.   
### `as_default`

View source

    
    as_default()
    
Returns a context manager that makes this `Graph` the default graph.

This method should be used if you want to create multiple graphs in the same
process. For convenience, a global default graph is provided, and all ops will
be added to this graph if you do not create a new graph explicitly.

Use this method with the `with` keyword to specify that ops created within the
scope of a block should be added to this graph. In this case, once the scope
of the `with` is exited, the previous default graph is set again as default.
There is a stack, so it's ok to have multiple nested levels of `as_default`
calls.

The default graph is a property of the current thread. If you create a new
thread, and wish to use the default graph in that thread, you must explicitly
add a `with g.as_default():` in that thread's function.

The following code examples are equivalent:

    
    # 1. Using Graph.as_default():
    g = tf.Graph()
    with g.as_default():
      c = tf.constant(5.0)
      assert c.graph is g
    
    # 2. Constructing and making default:
    with tf.Graph().as_default() as g:
      c = tf.constant(5.0)
      assert c.graph is g
    
If eager execution is enabled ops created under this context manager will be
added to the graph instead of executed eagerly.

Returns  
---  
A context manager for using this graph as the default graph.  
### `as_graph_def`

View source

    
    as_graph_def(
        from_version=None, add_shapes=False
    )
    
Returns a serialized `GraphDef` representation of this graph.

The serialized `GraphDef` can be imported into another `Graph` (using
`tf.import_graph_def`) or used with the C++ Session API.

This method is thread-safe.

Args  
---  
`from_version` |  Optional. If this is set, returns a `GraphDef` containing only the nodes that were added to this graph since its `version` property had the given value.   
`add_shapes` |  If true, adds an "_output_shapes" list attr to each node with the inferred shapes of each of its outputs.   
Returns  
---  
A `GraphDef` protocol buffer.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the `graph_def` would be too large.   
### `as_graph_element`

View source

    
    as_graph_element(
        obj, allow_tensor=True, allow_operation=True
    )
    
Returns the object referred to by `obj`, as an `Operation` or `Tensor`.

This function validates that `obj` represents an element of this graph, and
gives an informative error message if it is not.

This function is the canonical way to get/validate an object of one of the
allowed types from an external argument reference in the Session API.

This method may be called concurrently from multiple threads.

Args  
---  
`obj` |  A `Tensor`, an `Operation`, or the name of a tensor or operation. Can also be any object with an `_as_graph_element()` method that returns a value of one of these types. Note: `_as_graph_element` will be called inside the graph's lock and so may not modify the graph.   
`allow_tensor` |  If true, `obj` may refer to a `Tensor`.   
`allow_operation` |  If true, `obj` may refer to an `Operation`.   
Returns  
---  
The `Tensor` or `Operation` in the Graph corresponding to `obj`.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `obj` is not a type we support attempting to convert to types.   
`ValueError` |  If `obj` is of an appropriate type but invalid. For example, an invalid string.   
`KeyError` |  If `obj` is not an object in the graph.   
### `clear_collection`

View source

    
    clear_collection(
        name
    )
    
Clears all values in a collection.

Args  
---  
`name` |  The key for the collection. The `GraphKeys` class contains many standard names for collections.   
### `colocate_with`

View source

    
    @tf_contextlib.contextmanager
    colocate_with(
        op, ignore_existing=False
    )
    
Returns a context manager that specifies an op to colocate with.

> Note: this function is not for public use, only for internal libraries.
#### For example:

    
    a = tf.Variable([1.0])
    with g.colocate_with(a):
      b = tf.constant(1.0)
      c = tf.add(a, b)
    
`b` and `c` will always be colocated with `a`, no matter where `a` is
eventually placed.

> Note: Using a colocation scope resets any existing device constraints.
If `op` is `None` then `ignore_existing` must be `True` and the new scope
resets all colocation and device constraints.

Args  
---  
`op` |  The op to colocate all created ops with, or `None`.   
`ignore_existing` |  If true, only applies colocation of this op within the context, rather than applying all colocation properties on the stack. If `op` is `None`, this value must be `True`.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if op is None but ignore_existing is False.   
Yields  
---  
A context manager that specifies the op with which to colocate newly created
ops.  
### `container`

View source

    
    @tf_contextlib.contextmanager
    container(
        container_name
    )
    
Returns a context manager that specifies the resource container to use.

Stateful operations, such as variables and queues, can maintain their states
on devices so that they can be shared by multiple processes. A resource
container is a string name under which these stateful operations are tracked.
These resources can be released or cleared with `tf.Session.reset()`.

#### For example:

    
    with g.container('experiment0'):
      # All stateful Operations constructed in this context will be placed
      # in resource container "experiment0".
      v1 = tf.Variable([1.0])
      v2 = tf.Variable([2.0])
      with g.container("experiment1"):
        # All stateful Operations constructed in this context will be
        # placed in resource container "experiment1".
        v3 = tf.Variable([3.0])
        q1 = tf.queue.FIFOQueue(10, tf.float32)
      # All stateful Operations constructed in this context will be
      # be created in the "experiment0".
      v4 = tf.Variable([4.0])
      q1 = tf.queue.FIFOQueue(20, tf.float32)
      with g.container(""):
        # All stateful Operations constructed in this context will be
        # be placed in the default resource container.
        v5 = tf.Variable([5.0])
        q3 = tf.queue.FIFOQueue(30, tf.float32)
    
    # Resets container "experiment0", after which the state of v1, v2, v4, q1
    # will become undefined (such as uninitialized).
    tf.Session.reset(target, ["experiment0"])
    
Args  
---  
`container_name` |  container name string.   
Returns  
---  
A context manager for defining resource containers for stateful ops, yields
the container name.  
### `control_dependencies`

View source

    
    control_dependencies(
        control_inputs
    )
    
Returns a context manager that specifies control dependencies.

Use with the `with` keyword to specify that all operations constructed within
the context should have control dependencies on `control_inputs`. For example:

    
    with g.control_dependencies([a, b, c]):
      # `d` and `e` will only run after `a`, `b`, and `c` have executed.
      d = ...
      e = ...
    
Multiple calls to `control_dependencies()` can be nested, and in that case a
new `Operation` will have control dependencies on the union of
`control_inputs` from all active contexts.

    
    with g.control_dependencies([a, b]):
      # Ops constructed here run after `a` and `b`.
      with g.control_dependencies([c, d]):
        # Ops constructed here run after `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
    
You can pass None to clear the control dependencies:

    
    with g.control_dependencies([a, b]):
      # Ops constructed here run after `a` and `b`.
      with g.control_dependencies(None):
        # Ops constructed here run normally, not waiting for either `a` or `b`.
        with g.control_dependencies([c, d]):
          # Ops constructed here run after `c` and `d`, also not waiting
          # for either `a` or `b`.
    
> Note: The control dependencies context applies only to ops that are
> constructed within the context. Merely using an op or tensor in the context
> does not add a control dependency. The following example illustrates this
> point:
    
    # WRONG
    def my_func(pred, tensor):
      t = tf.matmul(tensor, tensor)
      with tf.control_dependencies([pred]):
        # The matmul op is created outside the context, so no control
        # dependency will be added.
        return t
    
    # RIGHT
    def my_func(pred, tensor):
      with tf.control_dependencies([pred]):
        # The matmul op is created in the context, so a control dependency
        # will be added.
        return tf.matmul(tensor, tensor)
    
Also note that though execution of ops created under this scope will trigger
execution of the dependencies, the ops created under this scope might still be
pruned from a normal tensorflow graph. For example, in the following snippet
of code the dependencies are never executed:

    
    loss = model.loss()
    with tf.control_dependencies(dependencies):
      loss = loss + tf.constant(1)  # note: dependencies ignored in the
                                    # backward pass
    return tf.gradients(loss, model.variables)
    
This is because evaluating the gradient graph does not require evaluating the
constant(1) op created in the forward pass.

Args  
---  
`control_inputs` |  A list of `Operation` or `Tensor` objects which must be executed or computed before running the operations defined in the context. Can also be `None` to clear the control dependencies.   
Returns  
---  
A context manager that specifies control dependencies for all operations
constructed within the context.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `control_inputs` is not a list of `Operation` or `Tensor` objects.   
### `create_op`

View source

    
    create_op(
        op_type, inputs, dtypes=None, input_types=None, name=None, attrs=None,
        op_def=None, compute_shapes=True, compute_device=True
    )
    
Creates an `Operation` in this graph. (deprecated arguments)

Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(compute_shapes)`. They will be
removed in a future version. Instructions for updating: Shapes are always
computed; don't use the compute_shapes as it has no effect.

This is a low-level interface for creating an `Operation`. Most programs will
not call this method directly, and instead use the Python op constructors,
such as `tf.constant()`, which add ops to the default graph.

Args  
---  
`op_type` |  The `Operation` type to create. This corresponds to the `OpDef.name` field for the proto that defines the operation.   
`inputs` |  A list of `Tensor` objects that will be inputs to the `Operation`.   
`dtypes` |  (Optional) A list of `DType` objects that will be the types of the tensors that the operation produces.   
`input_types` |  (Optional.) A list of `DType`s that will be the types of the tensors that the operation consumes. By default, uses the base `DType` of each input in `inputs`. Operations that expect reference-typed inputs must specify `input_types` explicitly.   
`name` |  (Optional.) A string name for the operation. If not specified, a name is generated based on `op_type`.   
`attrs` |  (Optional.) A dictionary where the key is the attribute name (a string) and the value is the respective `attr` attribute of the `NodeDef` proto that will represent the operation (an `AttrValue` proto).   
`op_def` |  (Optional.) The `OpDef` proto that describes the `op_type` that the operation will have.   
`compute_shapes` |  (Optional.) Deprecated. Has no effect (shapes are always computed).   
`compute_device` |  (Optional.) If True, device functions will be executed to compute the device property of the Operation.   
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  if any of the inputs is not a `Tensor`.   
`ValueError` |  if colocation conflicts with existing device assignment.   
Returns  
---  
An `Operation` object.  
### `device`

View source

    
    @tf_contextlib.contextmanager
    device(
        device_name_or_function
    )
    
Returns a context manager that specifies the default device to use.

The `device_name_or_function` argument may either be a device name string, a
device function, or None:

  * If it is a device name string, all operations constructed in this context will be assigned to the device with that name, unless overridden by a nested `device()` context.
  * If it is a function, it will be treated as a function from Operation objects to device name strings, and invoked each time a new Operation is created. The Operation will be assigned to the device with the returned name.
  * If it is None, all `device()` invocations from the enclosing context will be ignored.

For information about the valid syntax of device name strings, see the
documentation in `DeviceNameUtils`.

#### For example:

    
    with g.device('/device:GPU:0'):
      # All operations constructed in this context will be placed
      # on GPU 0.
      with g.device(None):
        # All operations constructed in this context will have no
        # assigned device.
    
    # Defines a function from `Operation` to device string.
    def matmul_on_gpu(n):
      if n.type == "MatMul":
        return "/device:GPU:0"
      else:
        return "/cpu:0"
    
    with g.device(matmul_on_gpu):
      # All operations of type "MatMul" constructed in this context
      # will be placed on GPU 0; all other operations will be placed
      # on CPU 0.
    
> Note: The device scope may be overridden by op wrappers or other library
> code. For example, a variable assignment op `v.assign()` must be colocated
> with the `tf.Variable` `v`, and incompatible device scopes will be ignored.
Args  
---  
`device_name_or_function` |  The device name or function to use in the context.   
Yields  
---  
A context manager that specifies the default device to use for newly created
ops.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  If device scopes are not properly nested.   
### `finalize`

View source

    
    finalize()
    
Finalizes this graph, making it read-only.

After calling `g.finalize()`, no new operations can be added to `g`. This
method is used to ensure that no operations are added to a graph when it is
shared between multiple threads, for example when using a
`tf.compat.v1.train.QueueRunner`.

### `get_all_collection_keys`

View source

    
    get_all_collection_keys()
    
Returns a list of collections used in this graph.

### `get_collection`

View source

    
    get_collection(
        name, scope=None
    )
    
Returns a list of values in the collection with the given `name`.

This is different from `get_collection_ref()` which always returns the actual
collection list if it exists in that it returns a new list each time it is
called.

Args  
---  
`name` |  The key for the collection. For example, the `GraphKeys` class contains many standard names for collections.   
`scope` |  (Optional.) A string. If supplied, the resulting list is filtered to include only items whose `name` attribute matches `scope` using `re.match`. Items without a `name` attribute are never returned if a scope is supplied. The choice of `re.match` means that a `scope` without special tokens filters by prefix.   
Returns  
---  
The list of values in the collection with the given `name`, or an empty list
if no value has been added to that collection. The list contains the values in
the order under which they were collected.  
### `get_collection_ref`

View source

    
    get_collection_ref(
        name
    )
    
Returns a list of values in the collection with the given `name`.

If the collection exists, this returns the list itself, which can be modified
in place to change the collection. If the collection does not exist, it is
created as an empty list and the list is returned.

This is different from `get_collection()` which always returns a copy of the
collection list if it exists and never creates an empty collection.

Args  
---  
`name` |  The key for the collection. For example, the `GraphKeys` class contains many standard names for collections.   
Returns  
---  
The list of values in the collection with the given `name`, or an empty list
if no value has been added to that collection.  
### `get_name_scope`

View source

    
    get_name_scope()
    
Returns the current name scope.

#### For example:

    
    with tf.name_scope('scope1'):
      with tf.name_scope('scope2'):
        print(tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph().get_name_scope())
    
would print the string `scope1/scope2`.

Returns  
---  
A string representing the current name scope.  
### `get_operation_by_name`

View source

    
    get_operation_by_name(
        name
    )
    
Returns the `Operation` with the given `name`.

This method may be called concurrently from multiple threads.

Args  
---  
`name` |  The name of the `Operation` to return.   
Returns  
---  
The `Operation` with the given `name`.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `name` is not a string.   
`KeyError` |  If `name` does not correspond to an operation in this graph.   
### `get_operations`

View source

    
    get_operations()
    
Return the list of operations in the graph.

You can modify the operations in place, but modifications to the list such as
inserts/delete have no effect on the list of operations known to the graph.

This method may be called concurrently from multiple threads.

Returns  
---  
A list of Operations.  
### `get_tensor_by_name`

View source

    
    get_tensor_by_name(
        name
    )
    
Returns the `Tensor` with the given `name`.

This method may be called concurrently from multiple threads.

Args  
---  
`name` |  The name of the `Tensor` to return.   
Returns  
---  
The `Tensor` with the given `name`.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `name` is not a string.   
`KeyError` |  If `name` does not correspond to a tensor in this graph.   
### `gradient_override_map`

View source

    
    @tf_contextlib.contextmanager
    gradient_override_map(
        op_type_map
    )
    
EXPERIMENTAL: A context manager for overriding gradient functions.

This context manager can be used to override the gradient function that will
be used for ops within the scope of the context.

#### For example:

    
    @tf.RegisterGradient("CustomSquare")
    def _custom_square_grad(op, grad):
      # ...
    
    with tf.Graph().as_default() as g:
      c = tf.constant(5.0)
      s_1 = tf.square(c)  # Uses the default gradient for tf.square.
      with g.gradient_override_map({"Square": "CustomSquare"}):
        s_2 = tf.square(s_2)  # Uses _custom_square_grad to compute the
                              # gradient of s_2.
    
Args  
---  
`op_type_map` |  A dictionary mapping op type strings to alternative op type strings.   
Returns  
---  
A context manager that sets the alternative op type to be used for one or more
ops created in that context.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `op_type_map` is not a dictionary mapping strings to strings.   
### `is_feedable`

View source

    
    is_feedable(
        tensor
    )
    
Returns `True` if and only if `tensor` is feedable.

### `is_fetchable`

View source

    
    is_fetchable(
        tensor_or_op
    )
    
Returns `True` if and only if `tensor_or_op` is fetchable.

### `name_scope`

View source

    
    @tf_contextlib.contextmanager
    name_scope(
        name
    )
    
Returns a context manager that creates hierarchical names for operations.

A graph maintains a stack of name scopes. A `with name_scope(...):` statement
pushes a new name onto the stack for the lifetime of the context.

The `name` argument will be interpreted as follows:

  * A string (not ending with '/') will create a new name scope, in which `name` is appended to the prefix of all operations created in the context. If `name` has been used before, it will be made unique by calling `self.unique_name(name)`.
  * A scope previously captured from a `with g.name_scope(...) as scope:` statement will be treated as an "absolute" name scope, which makes it possible to re-enter existing scopes.
  * A value of `None` or the empty string will reset the current name scope to the top-level (empty) name scope.

#### For example:

    
    with tf.Graph().as_default() as g:
      c = tf.constant(5.0, name="c")
      assert c.op.name == "c"
      c_1 = tf.constant(6.0, name="c")
      assert c_1.op.name == "c_1"
    
      # Creates a scope called "nested"
      with g.name_scope("nested") as scope:
        nested_c = tf.constant(10.0, name="c")
        assert nested_c.op.name == "nested/c"
    
        # Creates a nested scope called "inner".

The name of the scope itself can be captured by `with g.name_scope(...) as
scope:`, which stores the name of the scope in the variable `scope`. This
value can be used to name an operation that represents the overall result of
executing the ops in a scope. For example:

    
    inputs = tf.constant(...)
    with g.name_scope('my_layer') as scope:
      weights = tf.Variable(..., name="weights")
      biases = tf.Variable(..., name="biases")
      affine = tf.matmul(inputs, weights) + biases
      output = tf.nn.relu(affine, name=scope)
    
> Note: This constructor validates the given `name`. Valid scope names match
> one of the following regular expressions:
    
    [A-Za-z0-9.][A-Za-z0-9_.\-/]* (for scopes at the root)
    [A-Za-z0-9_.\-/]* (for other scopes)
    
Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the scope.   
Returns  
---  
A context manager that installs `name` as a new name scope.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `name` is not a valid scope name, according to the rules above.   
### `prevent_feeding`

View source

    
    prevent_feeding(
        tensor
    )
    
Marks the given `tensor` as unfeedable in this graph.

### `prevent_fetching`

View source

    
    prevent_fetching(
        op
    )
    
Marks the given `op` as unfetchable in this graph.

### `switch_to_thread_local`

View source

    
    switch_to_thread_local()
    
Make device, colocation and dependencies stacks thread-local.

Device, colocation and dependencies stacks are not thread-local be default. If
multiple threads access them, then the state is shared. This means that one
thread may affect the behavior of another thread.

After this method is called, the stacks become thread-local. If multiple
threads access them, then the state is not shared. Each thread uses its own
value; a thread doesn't affect other threads by mutating such a stack.

The initial value for every thread's stack is set to the current value of the
stack when `switch_to_thread_local()` was first called.

### `unique_name`

View source

    
    unique_name(
        name, mark_as_used=True
    )
    
Return a unique operation name for `name`.

> Note: You rarely need to call `unique_name()` directly. Most of the time you
> just need to create `with g.name_scope()` blocks to generate structured
> names.
`unique_name` is used to generate structured names, separated by `"/"`, to
help identify operations when debugging a graph. Operation names are displayed
in error messages reported by the TensorFlow runtime, and in various
visualization tools such as TensorBoard.

If `mark_as_used` is set to `True`, which is the default, a new unique name is
created and marked as in use. If it's set to `False`, the unique name is
returned without actually being marked as used. This is useful when the caller
simply wants to know what the name to be created will be.

Args  
---  
`name` |  The name for an operation.   
`mark_as_used` |  Whether to mark this name as being used.   
Returns  
---  
A string to be passed to `create_op()` that will be used to name the operation
being created.
