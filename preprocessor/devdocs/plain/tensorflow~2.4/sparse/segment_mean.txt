# tf.sparse.segment_mean

View source on GitHub  Computes the mean along sparse segments of a tensor.

    
    tf.sparse.segment_mean(
        data, indices, segment_ids, num_segments=None, name=None
    )
    
Read the section on segmentation for an explanation of segments. Like `tf.math.segment_mean`, but `segment_ids` can have rank less than `data`'s first dimension, selecting a subset of dimension 0, specified by `indices`. `segment_ids` is allowed to have missing ids, in which case the output will be zeros at those indices. In those cases `num_segments` is used to determine the size of the output. | Args  
---  
`data` |  A `Tensor` with data that will be assembled in the output.   
`indices` |  A 1-D `Tensor` with indices into `data`. Has same rank as `segment_ids`.   
`segment_ids` |  A 1-D `Tensor` with indices into the output `Tensor`. Values should be sorted and can be repeated.   
`num_segments` |  An optional int32 scalar. Indicates the size of the output `Tensor`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `tensor` of the shape as data, except for dimension 0 which has size `k`,
the number of segments specified via `num_segments` or inferred for the last
element in `segments_ids`.
