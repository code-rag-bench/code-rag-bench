# tf.sparse.reduce_sum

View source on GitHub  Computes the sum of elements across dimensions of a
SparseTensor.

    
    tf.sparse.reduce_sum(
        sp_input, axis=None, keepdims=None, output_is_sparse=False, name=None
    )
    
This Op takes a SparseTensor and is the sparse counterpart to
`tf.reduce_sum()`. In particular, this Op also returns a dense `Tensor` if
`output_is_sparse` is `False`, or a `SparseTensor` if `output_is_sparse` is
`True`.

> Note: if `output_is_sparse` is True, a gradient is not defined for this
> function, so it can't be used in training models that need gradient descent.
Reduces `sp_input` along the dimensions given in `axis`. Unless `keepdims` is
true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each entry in `axis`. If
`keepdims` is true, the reduced dimensions are retained with length 1. If
`axis` has no entries, all dimensions are reduced, and a tensor with a single
element is returned. Additionally, the axes can be negative, similar to the
indexing rules in Python.

#### For example:

    
    # 'x' represents [[1, ?, 1]
    #                 [?, 1, ?]]
    # where ? is implicitly-zero.
    tf.sparse.reduce_sum(x) ==> 3
    tf.sparse.reduce_sum(x, 0) ==> [1, 1, 1]
    tf.sparse.reduce_sum(x, 1) ==> [2, 1]  # Can also use -1 as the axis.
    tf.sparse.reduce_sum(x, 1, keepdims=True) ==> [[2], [1]]
    tf.sparse.reduce_sum(x, [0, 1]) ==> 3
    
| Args  
---  
`sp_input` |  The SparseTensor to reduce. Should have numeric type.   
`axis` |  The dimensions to reduce; list or scalar. If `None` (the default), reduces all dimensions.   
`keepdims` |  If true, retain reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`output_is_sparse` |  If true, returns a `SparseTensor` instead of a dense `Tensor` (the default).   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The reduced Tensor or the reduced SparseTensor if `output_is_sparse` is True.
