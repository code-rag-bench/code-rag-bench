`tf.compat.v1.py_function`

    
    tf.py_function(
        func, inp, Tout, name=None
    )
    
This function allows expressing computations in a TensorFlow graph as Python
functions. In particular, it wraps a Python function `func` in a once-
differentiable TensorFlow operation that executes it with eager execution
enabled. As a consequence, `tf.py_function` makes it possible to express
control flow using Python constructs (`if`, `while`, `for`, etc.), instead of
TensorFlow control flow constructs (`tf.cond`, `tf.while_loop`). For example,
you might use `tf.py_function` to implement the log huber function:

    
    def log_huber(x, m):
      if tf.abs(x) <= m:
        return x**2
      else:
        return m**2 * (1 - 2 * tf.math.log(m) + tf.math.log(x**2))
    
    x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32)
    m = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32)
    
    y = tf.py_function(func=log_huber, inp=[x, m], Tout=tf.float32)
    dy_dx = tf.gradients(y, x)[0]
    
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      # The session executes `log_huber` eagerly. Given the feed values below,
      # it will take the first branch, so `y` evaluates to 1.0 and
      # `dy_dx` evaluates to 2.0.
      y, dy_dx = sess.run([y, dy_dx], feed_dict={x: 1.0, m: 2.0})
    
You can also use `tf.py_function` to debug your models at runtime using Python
tools, i.e., you can isolate portions of your code that you want to debug,
wrap them in Python functions and insert `pdb` tracepoints or print statements
as desired, and wrap those functions in `tf.py_function`. For more information
on eager execution, see the Eager guide. `tf.py_function` is similar in spirit
to `tf.compat.v1.py_func`, but unlike the latter, the former lets you use
TensorFlow operations in the wrapped Python function. In particular, while
`tf.compat.v1.py_func` only runs on CPUs and wraps functions that take NumPy
arrays as inputs and return NumPy arrays as outputs, `tf.py_function` can be
placed on GPUs and wraps functions that take Tensors as inputs, execute
TensorFlow operations in their bodies, and return Tensors as outputs. Like
`tf.compat.v1.py_func`, `tf.py_function` has the following limitations with
respect to serialization and distribution:

  * The body of the function (i.e. `func`) will not be serialized in a `GraphDef`. Therefore, you should not use this function if you need to serialize your model and restore it in a different environment.
  * The operation must run in the same address space as the Python program that calls `tf.py_function()`. If you are using distributed TensorFlow, you must run a `tf.distribute.Server` in the same process as the program that calls `tf.py_function()` and you must pin the created operation to a device in that server (e.g. using `with tf.device():`).

| Args  
---  
`func` |  A Python function which accepts a list of `Tensor` objects having element types that match the corresponding `tf.Tensor` objects in `inp` and returns a list of `Tensor` objects (or a single `Tensor`, or `None`) having element types that match the corresponding values in `Tout`.   
`inp` |  A list of `Tensor` objects.   
`Tout` |  A list or tuple of tensorflow data types or a single tensorflow data type if there is only one, indicating what `func` returns; an empty list if no value is returned (i.e., if the return value is `None`).   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A list of `Tensor` or a single `Tensor` which `func` computes; an empty list
if `func` returns None.
