`tf.compat.v1.image.ssim`

    
    tf.image.ssim(
        img1, img2, max_val, filter_size=11, filter_sigma=1.5, k1=0.01, k2=0.03
    )
    
This function is based on the standard SSIM implementation from: Wang, Z.,
Bovik, A. C., Sheikh, H. R., & Simoncelli, E. P. (2004). Image quality
assessment: from error visibility to structural similarity. IEEE transactions
on image processing.

> Note: The true SSIM is only defined on grayscale. This function does not
> perform any colorspace transform. (If the input is already YUV, then it will
> compute YUV SSIM average.)
#### Details:

  * 11x11 Gaussian filter of width 1.5 is used.
  * k1 = 0.01, k2 = 0.03 as in the original paper.

The image sizes must be at least 11x11 because of the filter size.

#### Example:

    
    # Read images from file.
    im1 = tf.decode_png('path/to/im1.png')
    im2 = tf.decode_png('path/to/im2.png')
    # Compute SSIM over tf.uint8 Tensors.
    ssim1 = tf.image.ssim(im1, im2, max_val=255, filter_size=11,
                          filter_sigma=1.5, k1=0.01, k2=0.03)
    
    # Compute SSIM over tf.float32 Tensors.
    im1 = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(im1, tf.float32)
    im2 = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(im2, tf.float32)
    ssim2 = tf.image.ssim(im1, im2, max_val=1.0, filter_size=11,
                          filter_sigma=1.5, k1=0.01, k2=0.03)
    # ssim1 and ssim2 both have type tf.float32 and are almost equal.
    
| Args  
---  
`img1` |  First image batch.   
`img2` |  Second image batch.   
`max_val` |  The dynamic range of the images (i.e., the difference between the maximum the and minimum allowed values).   
`filter_size` |  Default value 11 (size of gaussian filter).   
`filter_sigma` |  Default value 1.5 (width of gaussian filter).   
`k1` |  Default value 0.01   
`k2` |  Default value 0.03 (SSIM is less sensitivity to K2 for lower values, so it would be better if we took the values in the range of 0 < K2 < 0.4).   
Returns  
---  
A tensor containing an SSIM value for each image in batch. Returned SSIM
values are in range (-1, 1], when pixel values are non-negative. Returns a
tensor with shape: broadcast(img1.shape[:-3], img2.shape[:-3]).
