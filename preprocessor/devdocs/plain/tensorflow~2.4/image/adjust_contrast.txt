    tf.image.adjust_contrast(
        images, contrast_factor
    )
    
This is a convenience method that converts RGB images to float representation,
adjusts their contrast, and then converts them back to the original data type.
If several adjustments are chained, it is advisable to minimize the number of
redundant conversions. `images` is a tensor of at least 3 dimensions. The last
3 dimensions are interpreted as `[height, width, channels]`. The other
dimensions only represent a collection of images, such as `[batch, height,
width, channels].` Contrast is adjusted independently for each channel of each
image. For each channel, this Op computes the mean of the image pixels in the
channel and then adjusts each component `x` of each pixel to `(x - mean) *
contrast_factor + mean`.

#### Usage Example:

    
    x = [[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
          [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]],
        [[7.0, 8.0, 9.0],
          [10.0, 11.0, 12.0]]]
    tf.image.adjust_contrast(x, 2)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 2, 3), dtype=float32, numpy=
    array([[[-3.5, -2.5, -1.5],
            [ 2.5,  3.5,  4.5]],
           [[ 8.5,  9.5, 10.5],
            [14.5, 15.5, 16.5]]], dtype=float32)>
