    tf.image.adjust_brightness(
        image, delta
    )
    
This is a convenience method that converts RGB images to float representation,
adjusts their brightness, and then converts them back to the original data
type. If several adjustments are chained, it is advisable to minimize the
number of redundant conversions. The value `delta` is added to all components
of the tensor `image`. `image` is converted to `float` and scaled
appropriately if it is in fixed-point representation, and `delta` is converted
to the same data type. For regular images, `delta` should be in the range
`(-1,1)`, as it is added to the image in floating point representation, where
pixel values are in the `[0,1)` range.

#### Usage Example:

    
    x = [[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
          [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]],
        [[7.0, 8.0, 9.0],
          [10.0, 11.0, 12.0]]]
    tf.image.adjust_brightness(x, delta=0.1)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 2, 3), dtype=float32, numpy=
    array([[[ 1.1,  2.1,  3.1],
            [ 4.1,  5.1,  6.1]],
           [[ 7.1,  8.1,  9.1],
            [10.1, 11.1, 12.1]]], dtype=float32)>
    
| Args  
---  
`image` |  RGB image or images to adjust.   
`delta` |  A scalar. Amount to add to the pixel values.   
Returns  
---  
A brightness-adjusted tensor of the same shape and type as `image`.
