# tf.image.crop_and_resize

View source on GitHub  Extracts crops from the input image tensor and resizes
them.

    
    tf.image.crop_and_resize(
        image, boxes, box_indices, crop_size, method='bilinear',
        extrapolation_value=0, name=None
    )
    
Extracts crops from the input image tensor and resizes them using bilinear sampling or nearest neighbor sampling (possibly with aspect ratio change) to a common output size specified by `crop_size`. This is more general than the `crop_to_bounding_box` op which extracts a fixed size slice from the input image and does not allow resizing or aspect ratio change. Returns a tensor with `crops` from the input `image` at positions defined at the bounding box locations in `boxes`. The cropped boxes are all resized (with bilinear or nearest neighbor interpolation) to a fixed `size = [crop_height, crop_width]`. The result is a 4-D tensor `[num_boxes, crop_height, crop_width, depth]`. The resizing is corner aligned. In particular, if `boxes = [[0, 0, 1, 1]]`, the method will give identical results to using `tf.compat.v1.image.resize_bilinear()` or `tf.compat.v1.image.resize_nearest_neighbor()`(depends on the `method` argument) with `align_corners=True`. | Args  
---  
`image` |  A 4-D tensor of shape `[batch, image_height, image_width, depth]`. Both `image_height` and `image_width` need to be positive.   
`boxes` |  A 2-D tensor of shape `[num_boxes, 4]`. The `i`-th row of the tensor specifies the coordinates of a box in the `box_ind[i]` image and is specified in normalized coordinates `[y1, x1, y2, x2]`. A normalized coordinate value of `y` is mapped to the image coordinate at `y * (image_height - 1)`, so as the `[0, 1]` interval of normalized image height is mapped to `[0, image_height - 1]` in image height coordinates. We do allow `y1` > `y2`, in which case the sampled crop is an up-down flipped version of the original image. The width dimension is treated similarly. Normalized coordinates outside the `[0, 1]` range are allowed, in which case we use `extrapolation_value` to extrapolate the input image values.   
`box_indices` |  A 1-D tensor of shape `[num_boxes]` with int32 values in `[0, batch)`. The value of `box_ind[i]` specifies the image that the `i`-th box refers to.   
`crop_size` |  A 1-D tensor of 2 elements, `size = [crop_height, crop_width]`. All cropped image patches are resized to this size. The aspect ratio of the image content is not preserved. Both `crop_height` and `crop_width` need to be positive.   
`method` |  An optional string specifying the sampling method for resizing. It can be either `"bilinear"` or `"nearest"` and default to `"bilinear"`. Currently two sampling methods are supported: Bilinear and Nearest Neighbor.   
`extrapolation_value` |  An optional `float`. Defaults to `0`. Value used for extrapolation, when applicable.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A 4-D tensor of shape `[num_boxes, crop_height, crop_width, depth]`.  
#### Example:

    
    import tensorflow as tf
    BATCH_SIZE = 1
    NUM_BOXES = 5
    IMAGE_HEIGHT = 256
    IMAGE_WIDTH = 256
    CHANNELS = 3
    CROP_SIZE = (24, 24)
    
    image = tf.random.normal(shape=(BATCH_SIZE, IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH,
    CHANNELS) )
    boxes = tf.random.uniform(shape=(NUM_BOXES, 4))
    box_indices = tf.random.uniform(shape=(NUM_BOXES,), minval=0,
    maxval=BATCH_SIZE, dtype=tf.int32)
    output = tf.image.crop_and_resize(image, boxes, box_indices, CROP_SIZE)
    output.shape  #=> (5, 24, 24, 3)
