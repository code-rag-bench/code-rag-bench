`tf.compat.v1.image.non_max_suppression_with_scores`

    
    tf.image.non_max_suppression_with_scores(
        boxes, scores, max_output_size, iou_threshold=0.5,
        score_threshold=float('-inf'), soft_nms_sigma=0.0, name=None
    )
    
Prunes away boxes that have high intersection-over-union (IOU) overlap with
previously selected boxes. Bounding boxes are supplied as `[y1, x1, y2, x2]`,
where `(y1, x1)` and `(y2, x2)` are the coordinates of any diagonal pair of
box corners and the coordinates can be provided as normalized (i.e., lying in
the interval `[0, 1]`) or absolute. Note that this algorithm is agnostic to
where the origin is in the coordinate system. Note that this algorithm is
invariant to orthogonal transformations and translations of the coordinate
system; thus translating or reflections of the coordinate system result in the
same boxes being selected by the algorithm. The output of this operation is a
set of integers indexing into the input collection of bounding boxes
representing the selected boxes. The bounding box coordinates corresponding to
the selected indices can then be obtained using the `tf.gather` operation. For
example:

    
    selected_indices, selected_scores = tf.image.non_max_suppression_padded(
        boxes, scores, max_output_size, iou_threshold=1.0, score_threshold=0.1,
        soft_nms_sigma=0.5)
    selected_boxes = tf.gather(boxes, selected_indices)
    
This function generalizes the `tf.image.non_max_suppression` op by also supporting a Soft-NMS (with Gaussian weighting) mode (c.f. Bodla et al, https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04503) where boxes reduce the score of other overlapping boxes instead of directly causing them to be pruned. Consequently, in contrast to `tf.image.non_max_suppression`, `tf.image.non_max_suppression_padded` returns the new scores of each input box in the second output, `selected_scores`. To enable this Soft-NMS mode, set the `soft_nms_sigma` parameter to be larger than 0. When `soft_nms_sigma` equals 0, the behavior of `tf.image.non_max_suppression_padded` is identical to that of `tf.image.non_max_suppression` (except for the extra output) both in function and in running time. | Args  
---  
`boxes` |  A 2-D float `Tensor` of shape `[num_boxes, 4]`.   
`scores` |  A 1-D float `Tensor` of shape `[num_boxes]` representing a single score corresponding to each box (each row of boxes).   
`max_output_size` |  A scalar integer `Tensor` representing the maximum number of boxes to be selected by non-max suppression.   
`iou_threshold` |  A float representing the threshold for deciding whether boxes overlap too much with respect to IOU.   
`score_threshold` |  A float representing the threshold for deciding when to remove boxes based on score.   
`soft_nms_sigma` |  A scalar float representing the Soft NMS sigma parameter; See Bodla et al, https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04503). When `soft_nms_sigma=0.0` (which is default), we fall back to standard (hard) NMS.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
`selected_indices` |  A 1-D integer `Tensor` of shape `[M]` representing the selected indices from the boxes tensor, where `M <= max_output_size`.   
`selected_scores` |  A 1-D float tensor of shape `[M]` representing the corresponding scores for each selected box, where `M <= max_output_size`. Scores only differ from corresponding input scores when using Soft NMS (i.e. when `soft_nms_sigma>0`)
