# tf.case

View source on GitHub  Create a case operation.

    
    tf.case(
        pred_fn_pairs, default=None, exclusive=False, strict=False,
        name='case'
    )
    
See also `tf.switch_case`. The `pred_fn_pairs` parameter is a list of pairs of
size N. Each pair contains a boolean scalar tensor and a python callable that
creates the tensors to be returned if the boolean evaluates to True. `default`
is a callable generating a list of tensors. All the callables in
`pred_fn_pairs` as well as `default` (if provided) should return the same
number and types of tensors. If `exclusive==True`, all predicates are
evaluated, and an exception is thrown if more than one of the predicates
evaluates to `True`. If `exclusive==False`, execution stops at the first
predicate which evaluates to True, and the tensors generated by the
corresponding function are returned immediately. If none of the predicates
evaluate to True, this operation returns the tensors generated by `default`.
`tf.case` supports nested structures as implemented in
`tf.contrib.framework.nest`. All of the callables must return the same
(possibly nested) value structure of lists, tuples, and/or named tuples.
Singleton lists and tuples form the only exceptions to this: when returned by
a callable, they are implicitly unpacked to single values. This behavior is
disabled by passing `strict=True`. Example 1:

#### Pseudocode:

    
    if (x < y) return 17;
    else return 23;
    
#### Expressions:

    
    f1 = lambda: tf.constant(17)
    f2 = lambda: tf.constant(23)
    r = tf.case([(tf.less(x, y), f1)], default=f2)
    
Example 2:

#### Pseudocode:

    
    if (x < y && x > z) raise OpError("Only one predicate may evaluate to True");
    if (x < y) return 17;
    else if (x > z) return 23;
    else return -1;
    
#### Expressions:

    
    def f1(): return tf.constant(17)
    def f2(): return tf.constant(23)
    def f3(): return tf.constant(-1)
    r = tf.case([(tf.less(x, y), f1), (tf.greater(x, z), f2)],
             default=f3, exclusive=True)
    
| Args  
---  
`pred_fn_pairs` |  List of pairs of a boolean scalar tensor and a callable which returns a list of tensors.   
`default` |  Optional callable that returns a list of tensors.   
`exclusive` |  True iff at most one predicate is allowed to evaluate to `True`.   
`strict` |  A boolean that enables/disables 'strict' mode; see above.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The tensors returned by the first pair whose predicate evaluated to True, or
those returned by `default` if none does.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `pred_fn_pairs` is not a list/tuple.   
`TypeError` |  If `pred_fn_pairs` is a list but does not contain 2-tuples.   
`TypeError` |  If `fns[i]` is not callable for any i, or `default` is not callable.   
#### V2 Compatibility

`pred_fn_pairs` could be a dictionary in v1. However, tf.Tensor and
tf.Variable are no longer hashable in v2, so cannot be used as a key for a
dictionary. Please use a list or a tuple instead.
