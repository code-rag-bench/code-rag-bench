        true_classes, num_true, num_sampled, unique, range_max, vocab_file='',

This operation randomly samples a tensor of sampled classes (`sampled_candidates`) from the range of integers `[0, range_max)`. The elements of `sampled_candidates` are drawn without replacement (if `unique=True`) or with replacement (if `unique=False`) from the base distribution. The base distribution is read from a file or passed in as an in-memory array. There is also an option to skew the distribution by applying a distortion power to the weights. In addition, this operation returns tensors `true_expected_count` and `sampled_expected_count` representing the number of times each of the target classes (`true_classes`) and the sampled classes (`sampled_candidates`) is expected to occur in an average tensor of sampled classes. These values correspond to `Q(y|x)` defined in this document. If `unique=True`, then these are post-rejection probabilities and we compute them approximately. | Args  
---  
`true_classes` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size, num_true]`. The target classes.   
`num_true` |  An `int`. The number of target classes per training example.   
`num_sampled` |  An `int`. The number of classes to randomly sample.   
`unique` |  A `bool`. Determines whether all sampled classes in a batch are unique.   
`range_max` |  An `int`. The number of possible classes.   
`vocab_file` |  Each valid line in this file (which should have a CSV-like format) corresponds to a valid word ID. IDs are in sequential order, starting from num_reserved_ids. The last entry in each line is expected to be a value corresponding to the count or relative probability. Exactly one of `vocab_file` and `unigrams` needs to be passed to this operation.   
`distortion` |  The distortion is used to skew the unigram probability distribution. Each weight is first raised to the distortion's power before adding to the internal unigram distribution. As a result, `distortion = 1.0` gives regular unigram sampling (as defined by the vocab file), and `distortion = 0.0` gives a uniform distribution.   
`num_reserved_ids` |  Optionally some reserved IDs can be added in the range `[0, num_reserved_ids)` by the users. One use case is that a special unknown word token is used as ID 0. These IDs will have a sampling probability of 0.   
`num_shards` |  A sampler can be used to sample from a subset of the original range in order to speed up the whole computation through parallelism. This parameter (together with `shard`) indicates the number of partitions that are being used in the overall computation.   
`shard` |  A sampler can be used to sample from a subset of the original range in order to speed up the whole computation through parallelism. This parameter (together with `num_shards`) indicates the particular partition number of the operation, when partitioning is being used.   
`unigrams` |  A list of unigram counts or probabilities, one per ID in sequential order. Exactly one of `vocab_file` and `unigrams` should be passed to this operation.   
`seed` |  An `int`. An operation-specific seed. Default is 0.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
`sampled_candidates` |  A tensor of type `int64` and shape `[num_sampled]`. The sampled classes.   
`true_expected_count` |  A tensor of type `float`. Same shape as `true_classes`. The expected counts under the sampling distribution of each of `true_classes`.   
`sampled_expected_count` |  A tensor of type `float`. Same shape as `sampled_candidates`. The expected counts under the sampling distribution of each of `sampled_candidates`.
