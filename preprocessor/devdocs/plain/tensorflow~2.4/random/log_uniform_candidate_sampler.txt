    tf.random.log_uniform_candidate_sampler(
        true_classes, num_true, num_sampled, unique, range_max, seed=None, name=None
    )
    
This operation randomly samples a tensor of sampled classes (`sampled_candidates`) from the range of integers `[0, range_max)`. The elements of `sampled_candidates` are drawn without replacement (if `unique=True`) or with replacement (if `unique=False`) from the base distribution. The base distribution for this operation is an approximately log-uniform or Zipfian distribution: `P(class) = (log(class + 2) - log(class + 1)) / log(range_max + 1)` This sampler is useful when the target classes approximately follow such a distribution - for example, if the classes represent words in a lexicon sorted in decreasing order of frequency. If your classes are not ordered by decreasing frequency, do not use this op. In addition, this operation returns tensors `true_expected_count` and `sampled_expected_count` representing the number of times each of the target classes (`true_classes`) and the sampled classes (`sampled_candidates`) is expected to occur in an average tensor of sampled classes. These values correspond to `Q(y|x)` defined in this document. If `unique=True`, then these are post-rejection probabilities and we compute them approximately. | Args  
---  
`true_classes` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size, num_true]`. The target classes.   
`num_true` |  An `int`. The number of target classes per training example.   
`num_sampled` |  An `int`. The number of classes to randomly sample.   
`unique` |  A `bool`. Determines whether all sampled classes in a batch are unique.   
`range_max` |  An `int`. The number of possible classes.   
`seed` |  An `int`. An operation-specific seed. Default is 0.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
`sampled_candidates` |  A tensor of type `int64` and shape `[num_sampled]`. The sampled classes.   
`true_expected_count` |  A tensor of type `float`. Same shape as `true_classes`. The expected counts under the sampling distribution of each of `true_classes`.   
`sampled_expected_count` |  A tensor of type `float`. Same shape as `sampled_candidates`. The expected counts under the sampling distribution of each of `sampled_candidates`.
