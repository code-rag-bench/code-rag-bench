# tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator

Computes Jacobian-vector products ("JVP"s) using forward-mode autodiff.

    
    tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(
        primals, tangents
    )
    
Compare to `tf.GradientTape` which computes vector-Jacobian products ("VJP"s)
using reverse-mode autodiff (backprop). Reverse mode is more attractive when
computing gradients of a scalar-valued function with respect to many inputs
(e.g. a neural network with many parameters and a scalar loss). Forward mode
works best on functions with many outputs and few inputs. Since it does not
hold on to intermediate activations, it is much more memory efficient than
backprop where it is applicable.

Consider a simple linear regression:

    
    x = tf.constant([[2.0, 3.0], [1.0, 4.0]])
    dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    dense.build([None, 2])
    with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(
       primals=dense.kernel,
       tangents=tf.constant([[1.], [0.]])) as acc:
      loss = tf.reduce_sum((dense(x) - tf.constant([1., -1.])) ** 2.)
    acc.jvp(loss)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=...>
    
The example has two variables containing parameters, `dense.kernel` (2
parameters) and `dense.bias` (1 parameter). Considering the training data `x`
as a constant, this means the Jacobian matrix for the function mapping from
parameters to loss has one row and three columns.

With forwardprop, we specify a length-three vector in advance which multiplies
the Jacobian. The `primals` constructor argument is the parameter (a
`tf.Tensor` or `tf.Variable`) we're specifying a vector for, and the
`tangents` argument is the "vector" in Jacobian-vector product. If our goal is
to compute the entire Jacobian matrix, forwardprop computes one column at a
time while backprop computes one row at a time. Since the Jacobian in the
linear regression example has only one row, backprop requires fewer
invocations:

    
    x = tf.constant([[2.0, 3.0], [1.0, 4.0]])
    dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    dense.build([None, 2])
    loss_fn = lambda: tf.reduce_sum((dense(x) - tf.constant([1., -1.])) ** 2.)
    kernel_fprop = []
    with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(
        dense.kernel, tf.constant([[1.], [0.]])) as acc:
      kernel_fprop.append(acc.jvp(loss_fn()))
    with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(
        dense.kernel, tf.constant([[0.], [1.]])) as acc:
      kernel_fprop.append(acc.jvp(loss_fn()))
    with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(dense.bias, tf.constant([1.])) as acc:
      bias_fprop = acc.jvp(loss_fn())
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      loss = loss_fn()
    kernel_grad, bias_grad = tape.gradient(loss, (dense.kernel, dense.bias))
    np.testing.assert_allclose(
        kernel_grad, tf.stack(kernel_fprop)[:, tf.newaxis])
    np.testing.assert_allclose(bias_grad, bias_fprop[tf.newaxis])
    
Implicit in the `tape.gradient` call is a length-one vector which left-
multiplies the Jacobian, a vector-Jacobian product.

`ForwardAccumulator` maintains JVPs corresponding primal tensors it is
watching, derived from the original `primals` specified in the constructor. As
soon as a primal tensor is deleted, `ForwardAccumulator` deletes the
corresponding JVP.

`acc.jvp(x)` retrieves `acc`'s JVP corresponding to the primal tensor `x`. It
does not perform any computation. `acc.jvp` calls can be repeated as long as
`acc` is accessible, whether the context manager is active or not. New JVPs
are only computed while the context manager is active.

Note that `ForwardAccumulator`s are always applied in the order their context
managers were entered, so inner accumulators will not see JVP computation from
outer accumulators. Take higher-order JVPs from outer accumulators:

    
    primal = tf.constant(1.1)
    with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(primal, tf.constant(1.)) as outer:
      with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(primal, tf.constant(1.)) as inner:
        primal_out = primal ** tf.constant(3.5)
    inner_jvp = inner.jvp(primal_out)
    inner_jvp  # 3.5 * 1.1 ** 2.5
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=4.4417057>
    outer.jvp(inner_jvp)  # 3.5 * 2.5 * 1.1 ** 1.5
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=10.094786>
    
Reversing the collection in the last line to instead retrieve
`inner.jvp(outer.jvp(primal_out))` will not work.

Strict nesting also applies to combinations of `ForwardAccumulator` and
`tf.GradientTape`. More deeply nested `GradientTape` objects will ignore the
products of outer `ForwardAccumulator` objects. This allows (for example)
memory-efficient forward-over-backward computation of Hessian-vector products,
where the inner `GradientTape` would otherwise hold on to all intermediate
JVPs:

    
    v = tf.Variable([1., 2.])
    with tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator(
        v,
        # The "vector" in Hessian-vector product.
        tf.constant([1., 0.])) as acc:
      with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        y = tf.reduce_sum(v ** 3.)
      backward = tape.gradient(y, v)
    backward  # gradient from backprop
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,), dtype=float32, numpy=array([ 3., 12.], dtype=float32)>
    acc.jvp(backward)  # forward-over-backward Hessian-vector product
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,), dtype=float32, numpy=array([6., 0.], dtype=float32)>
    
Args  
---  
`primals` |  A tensor or nested structure of tensors to watch.   
`tangents` |  A tensor or nested structure of tensors, with the same nesting structure as `primals`, with each element being a vector with the same size as the corresponding primal element.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the same tensor or variable is specified multiple times in `primals`.   
## Methods

### `jvp`

View source

    
    jvp(
        primals, unconnected_gradients=tf.UnconnectedGradients.NONE
    )
    
Fetches the Jacobian-vector product computed for `primals`.

Note that this method performs no computation, and simply looks up a JVP that
was already computed (unlike backprop using a `tf.GradientTape`, where the
computation happens on the call to `tape.gradient`).

Args  
---  
`primals` |  A watched Tensor or structure of Tensors to fetch the JVPs for.   
`unconnected_gradients` |  A value which can either hold 'none' or 'zero' and alters the value which will be returned if no JVP was computed for `primals`. The possible values and effects are detailed in 'tf.UnconnectedGradients' and it defaults to 'none'.   
Returns  
---  
Tensors with the same shapes and dtypes as `primals`, or None if no JVP is
available.
