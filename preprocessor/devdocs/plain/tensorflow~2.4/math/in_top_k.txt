    tf.math.in_top_k(
        targets, predictions, k, name=None
    )
    
This outputs a `batch_size` bool array, an entry `out[i]` is `true` if the prediction for the target class is finite (not inf, -inf, or nan) and among the top `k` predictions among all predictions for example `i`. Note that the behavior of `InTopK` differs from the `TopK` op in its handling of ties; if multiple classes have the same prediction value and straddle the top-`k` boundary, all of those classes are considered to be in the top `k`. More formally, let \\(predictions_i\\) be the predictions for all classes for example `i`, \\(targets_i\\) be the target class for example `i`, \\(out_i\\) be the output for example `i`, $$out_i = predictions_{i, targets_i} \in TopKIncludingTies(predictions_i)$$  | Args  
---  
`predictions` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32`. A `batch_size` x `classes` tensor.   
`targets` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. A `batch_size` vector of class ids.   
`k` |  An `int`. Number of top elements to look at for computing precision.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `bool`. Computed Precision at `k` as a `bool Tensor`.
