# tf.math.confusion_matrix

View source on GitHub  Computes the confusion matrix from predictions and
labels.

    
    tf.math.confusion_matrix(
        labels, predictions, num_classes=None, weights=None, dtype=tf.dtypes.int32,
        name=None
    )
    
The matrix columns represent the prediction labels and the rows represent the
real labels. The confusion matrix is always a 2-D array of shape `[n, n]`,
where `n` is the number of valid labels for a given classification task. Both
prediction and labels must be 1-D arrays of the same shape in order for this
function to work. If `num_classes` is `None`, then `num_classes` will be set
to one plus the maximum value in either predictions or labels. Class labels
are expected to start at 0. For example, if `num_classes` is 3, then the
possible labels would be `[0, 1, 2]`. If `weights` is not `None`, then each
prediction contributes its corresponding weight to the total value of the
confusion matrix cell.

#### For example:

    
    tf.math.confusion_matrix([1, 2, 4], [2, 2, 4]) ==>
        [[0 0 0 0 0]
         [0 0 1 0 0]
         [0 0 1 0 0]
         [0 0 0 0 0]
         [0 0 0 0 1]]
    
Note that the possible labels are assumed to be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, resulting in a 5x5 confusion matrix. | Args  
---  
`labels` |  1-D `Tensor` of real labels for the classification task.   
`predictions` |  1-D `Tensor` of predictions for a given classification.   
`num_classes` |  The possible number of labels the classification task can have. If this value is not provided, it will be calculated using both predictions and labels array.   
`weights` |  An optional `Tensor` whose shape matches `predictions`.   
`dtype` |  Data type of the confusion matrix.   
`name` |  Scope name.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of type `dtype` with shape `[n, n]` representing the confusion
matrix, where `n` is the number of possible labels in the classification task.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If both predictions and labels are not 1-D vectors and have mismatched shapes, or if `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`.
