See Version compatibility. Forward-compatibility refers to scenarios where the
producer of a TensorFlow model (a GraphDef or SavedModel) is compiled against
a version of the TensorFlow library newer than what the consumer was compiled
against. The "producer" is typically a Python program that constructs and
trains a model while the "consumer" is typically another program that loads
and serves the model. TensorFlow has been supporting a 3 week forward-
compatibility window for programs compiled from source at HEAD. For example,
consider the case where a new operation `MyNewAwesomeAdd` is created with the
intent of replacing the implementation of an existing Python wrapper -
`tf.add`. The Python wrapper implementation should change from something like:

    
    def add(inputs, name=None):
      return gen_math_ops.add(inputs, name)
    
to:

    
    from tensorflow.python.compat import compat
    
    def add(inputs, name=None):
      if compat.forward_compatible(year, month, day):
        # Can use the awesome new implementation.
        return gen_math_ops.my_new_awesome_add(inputs, name)
      # To maintain forward compatibility, use the old implementation.
      return gen_math_ops.add(inputs, name)
    
Where `year`, `month`, and `day` specify the date beyond which binaries that consume a model are expected to have been updated to include the new operations. This date is typically at least 3 weeks beyond the date the code that adds the new operation is committed. | Args  
---  
`year` |  A year (e.g., 2018). Must be an `int`.   
`month` |  A month (1 <= month <= 12) in year. Must be an `int`.   
`day` |  A day (1 <= day <= 31, or 30, or 29, or 28) in month. Must be an `int`.   
Returns  
---  
True if the caller can expect that serialized TensorFlow graphs produced can
be consumed by programs that are compiled with the TensorFlow library source
code after (year, month, day).
