# Module: tf.compat.v1.keras.initializers

Keras initializer serialization / deserialization.

## Classes

`class Constant`: Initializer that generates tensors with constant values.

`class Identity`: Initializer that generates the identity matrix.

`class Initializer`: Initializer base class: all Keras initializers inherit
from this class.

`class Ones`: Initializer that generates tensors initialized to 1.

`class Orthogonal`: Initializer that generates an orthogonal matrix.

`class RandomNormal`: Initializer that generates tensors with a normal
distribution.

`class RandomUniform`: Initializer that generates tensors with a uniform
distribution.

`class TruncatedNormal`: Initializer that generates a truncated normal
distribution.

`class VarianceScaling`: Initializer capable of adapting its scale to the
shape of weights tensors.

`class Zeros`: Initializer that generates tensors initialized to 0.

`class constant`: Initializer that generates tensors with constant values.

`class glorot_normal`: The Glorot normal initializer, also called Xavier
normal initializer.
