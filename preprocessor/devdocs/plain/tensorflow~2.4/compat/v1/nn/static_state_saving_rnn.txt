# tf.compat.v1.nn.static_state_saving_rnn

RNN that accepts a state saver for time-truncated RNN calculation.
(deprecated)

    
    tf.compat.v1.nn.static_state_saving_rnn(
        cell, inputs, state_saver, state_name, sequence_length=None, scope=None
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: Please use `keras.layers.RNN(cell, stateful=True)`,
which is equivalent to this API Args  
---  
`cell` |  An instance of `RNNCell`.   
`inputs` |  A length T list of inputs, each a `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, input_size]`.   
`state_saver` |  A state saver object with methods `state` and `save_state`.   
`state_name` |  Python string or tuple of strings. The name to use with the state_saver. If the cell returns tuples of states (i.e., `cell.state_size` is a tuple) then `state_name` should be a tuple of strings having the same length as `cell.state_size`. Otherwise it should be a single string.   
`sequence_length` |  (optional) An int32/int64 vector size [batch_size]. See the documentation for rnn() for more details about sequence_length.   
`scope` |  VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "rnn".   
Returns  
---  
A pair (outputs, state) where: outputs is a length T list of outputs (one for
each input) states is the final state  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `cell` is not an instance of RNNCell.   
`ValueError` |  If `inputs` is `None` or an empty list, or if the arity and type of `state_name` does not match that of `cell.state_size`.
