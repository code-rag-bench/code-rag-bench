# tf.compat.v1.nn.static_bidirectional_rnn

Creates a bidirectional recurrent neural network. (deprecated)

    
    tf.compat.v1.nn.static_bidirectional_rnn(
        cell_fw, cell_bw, inputs, initial_state_fw=None, initial_state_bw=None,
        dtype=None, sequence_length=None, scope=None
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: Please use
`keras.layers.Bidirectional(keras.layers.RNN(cell, unroll=True))`, which is
equivalent to this API

Similar to the unidirectional case above (rnn) but takes input and builds
independent forward and backward RNNs with the final forward and backward
outputs depth-concatenated, such that the output will have the format
[time][batch][cell_fw.output_size + cell_bw.output_size]. The input_size of
forward and backward cell must match. The initial state for both directions is
zero by default (but can be set optionally) and no intermediate states are
ever returned -- the network is fully unrolled for the given (passed in)
length(s) of the sequence(s) or completely unrolled if length(s) is not given.

Args  
---  
`cell_fw` |  An instance of RNNCell, to be used for forward direction.   
`cell_bw` |  An instance of RNNCell, to be used for backward direction.   
`inputs` |  A length T list of inputs, each a tensor of shape [batch_size, input_size], or a nested tuple of such elements.   
`initial_state_fw` |  (optional) An initial state for the forward RNN. This must be a tensor of appropriate type and shape `[batch_size, cell_fw.state_size]`. If `cell_fw.state_size` is a tuple, this should be a tuple of tensors having shapes `[batch_size, s] for s in cell_fw.state_size`.   
`initial_state_bw` |  (optional) Same as for `initial_state_fw`, but using the corresponding properties of `cell_bw`.   
`dtype` |  (optional) The data type for the initial state. Required if either of the initial states are not provided.   
`sequence_length` |  (optional) An int32/int64 vector, size `[batch_size]`, containing the actual lengths for each of the sequences.   
`scope` |  VariableScope for the created subgraph; defaults to "bidirectional_rnn"   
Returns  
---  
A tuple (outputs, output_state_fw, output_state_bw) where: outputs is a length
`T` list of outputs (one for each input), which are depth-concatenated forward
and backward outputs. output_state_fw is the final state of the forward rnn.
output_state_bw is the final state of the backward rnn.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `cell_fw` or `cell_bw` is not an instance of `RNNCell`.   
`ValueError` |  If inputs is None or an empty list.
