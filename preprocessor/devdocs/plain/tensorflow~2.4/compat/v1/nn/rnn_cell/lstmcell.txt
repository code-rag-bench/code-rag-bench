# tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell

Long short-term memory unit (LSTM) recurrent network cell.

Inherits From: `RNNCell`, `Layer`, `Layer`, `Module`

    
    tf.compat.v1.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(
        num_units, use_peepholes=False, cell_clip=None, initializer=None, num_proj=None,
        proj_clip=None, num_unit_shards=None, num_proj_shards=None, forget_bias=1.0,
        state_is_tuple=True, activation=None, reuse=None, name=None, dtype=None,
        **kwargs
    )
    
The default non-peephole implementation is based on (Gers et al., 1999). The
peephole implementation is based on (Sak et al., 2014).

The class uses optional peep-hole connections, optional cell clipping, and an
optional projection layer.

Note that this cell is not optimized for performance. Please use
`tf.contrib.cudnn_rnn.CudnnLSTM` for better performance on GPU, or
`tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMBlockCell` and `tf.contrib.rnn.LSTMBlockFusedCell` for
better performance on CPU. References: Long short-term memory recurrent neural

Args  
---  
`num_units` |  int, The number of units in the LSTM cell.   
`use_peepholes` |  bool, set True to enable diagonal/peephole connections.   
`cell_clip` |  (optional) A float value, if provided the cell state is clipped by this value prior to the cell output activation.   
`initializer` |  (optional) The initializer to use for the weight and projection matrices.   
`num_proj` |  (optional) int, The output dimensionality for the projection matrices. If None, no projection is performed.   
`proj_clip` |  (optional) A float value. If `num_proj > 0` and `proj_clip` is provided, then the projected values are clipped elementwise to within `[-proj_clip, proj_clip]`.   
`num_unit_shards` |  Deprecated, will be removed by Jan. 2017. Use a variable_scope partitioner instead.   
`num_proj_shards` |  Deprecated, will be removed by Jan. 2017. Use a variable_scope partitioner instead.   
`forget_bias` |  Biases of the forget gate are initialized by default to 1 in order to reduce the scale of forgetting at the beginning of the training. Must set it manually to `0.0` when restoring from CudnnLSTM trained checkpoints.   
`state_is_tuple` |  If True, accepted and returned states are 2-tuples of the `c_state` and `m_state`. If False, they are concatenated along the column axis. This latter behavior will soon be deprecated.   
`activation` |  Activation function of the inner states. Default: `tanh`. It could also be string that is within Keras activation function names.   
`reuse` |  (optional) Python boolean describing whether to reuse variables in an existing scope. If not `True`, and the existing scope already has the given variables, an error is raised.   
`name` |  String, the name of the layer. Layers with the same name will share weights, but to avoid mistakes we require reuse=True in such cases.   
`dtype` |  Default dtype of the layer (default of `None` means use the type of the first input). Required when `build` is called before `call`.   
`**kwargs` |  Dict, keyword named properties for common layer attributes, like `trainable` etc when constructing the cell from configs of get_config(). When restoring from CudnnLSTM-trained checkpoints, use `CudnnCompatibleLSTMCell` instead.   
Attributes  
---  
`graph` |   
`output_size` |  Integer or TensorShape: size of outputs produced by this cell.   
`scope_name` |   
`state_size` |  size(s) of state(s) used by this cell. It can be represented by an Integer, a TensorShape or a tuple of Integers or TensorShapes.   
## Methods

### `get_initial_state`

View source

    
    get_initial_state(
        inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=None
    )
    
### `zero_state`

View source

    
    zero_state(
        batch_size, dtype
    )
    
Return zero-filled state tensor(s).

Args  
---  
`batch_size` |  int, float, or unit Tensor representing the batch size.   
`dtype` |  the data type to use for the state.   
Returns  
---  
If `state_size` is an int or TensorShape, then the return value is a `N-D`
tensor of shape `[batch_size, state_size]` filled with zeros. If `state_size`
is a nested list or tuple, then the return value is a nested list or tuple (of
the same structure) of `2-D` tensors with the shapes `[batch_size, s]` for
each s in `state_size`.
