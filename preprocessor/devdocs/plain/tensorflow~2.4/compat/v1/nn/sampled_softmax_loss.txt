# tf.compat.v1.nn.sampled_softmax_loss

Computes and returns the sampled softmax training loss.

    
    tf.compat.v1.nn.sampled_softmax_loss(
        weights, biases, labels, inputs, num_sampled, num_classes, num_true=1,
        sampled_values=None, remove_accidental_hits=True,
        partition_strategy='mod', name='sampled_softmax_loss',
        seed=None
    )
    
This is a faster way to train a softmax classifier over a huge number of
classes.

This operation is for training only. It is generally an underestimate of the
full softmax loss.

A common use case is to use this method for training, and calculate the full
softmax loss for evaluation or inference. In this case, you must set
`partition_strategy="div"` for the two losses to be consistent, as in the
following example:

    
    if mode == "train":
      loss = tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss(
          weights=weights,
          biases=biases,
          labels=labels,
          inputs=inputs,
          ...,
          partition_strategy="div")
    elif mode == "eval":
      logits = tf.matmul(inputs, tf.transpose(weights))
      logits = tf.nn.bias_add(logits, biases)
      labels_one_hot = tf.one_hot(labels, n_classes)
      loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(
          labels=labels_one_hot,
          logits=logits)
    
See our Candidate Sampling Algorithms Reference (pdf). Also see Section 3 of
(Jean et al., 2014) for the math.

Args  
---  
`weights` |  A `Tensor` of shape `[num_classes, dim]`, or a list of `Tensor` objects whose concatenation along dimension 0 has shape [num_classes, dim]. The (possibly-sharded) class embeddings.   
`biases` |  A `Tensor` of shape `[num_classes]`. The class biases.   
`labels` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size, num_true]`. The target classes. Note that this format differs from the `labels` argument of `nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`.   
`inputs` |  A `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, dim]`. The forward activations of the input network.   
`num_sampled` |  An `int`. The number of classes to randomly sample per batch.   
`num_classes` |  An `int`. The number of possible classes.   
`num_true` |  An `int`. The number of target classes per training example.   
`sampled_values` |  a tuple of (`sampled_candidates`, `true_expected_count`, `sampled_expected_count`) returned by a `*_candidate_sampler` function. (if None, we default to `log_uniform_candidate_sampler`)   
`remove_accidental_hits` |  A `bool`. whether to remove "accidental hits" where a sampled class equals one of the target classes. Default is True.   
`partition_strategy` |  A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant if `len(weights) > 1`. Currently `"div"` and `"mod"` are supported. Default is `"mod"`. See `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` for more details.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
`seed` |  random seed for candidate sampling. Default to None, which doesn't set the op-level random seed for candidate sampling.   
Returns  
---  
A `batch_size` 1-D tensor of per-example sampled softmax losses.
