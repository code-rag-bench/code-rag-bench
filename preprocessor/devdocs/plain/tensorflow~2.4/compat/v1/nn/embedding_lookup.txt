# tf.compat.v1.nn.embedding_lookup

Looks up embeddings for the given `ids` from a list of tensors.

    
    tf.compat.v1.nn.embedding_lookup(
        params, ids, partition_strategy='mod', name=None,
        validate_indices=True, max_norm=None
    )
    
This function is used to perform parallel lookups on the list of tensors in
`params`. It is a generalization of `tf.gather`, where `params` is interpreted
as a partitioning of a large embedding tensor. `params` may be a
`PartitionedVariable` as returned by using `tf.compat.v1.get_variable()` with
a partitioner.

If `len(params) > 1`, each element `id` of `ids` is partitioned between the
elements of `params` according to the `partition_strategy`. In all strategies,
if the id space does not evenly divide the number of partitions, each of the
first `(max_id + 1) % len(params)` partitions will be assigned one more id.

If `partition_strategy` is `"mod"`, we assign each id to partition `p = id %
len(params)`. For instance, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as: `[[0, 5,
10], [1, 6, 11], [2, 7, 12], [3, 8], [4, 9]]`

If `partition_strategy` is `"div"`, we assign ids to partitions in a
contiguous manner. In this case, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as:
`[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]`

If the input ids are ragged tensors, partition variables are not supported and
the partition strategy and the max_norm are ignored. The results of the lookup
are concatenated into a dense tensor. The returned tensor has shape
`shape(ids) + shape(params)[1:]`.

Args  
---  
`params` |  A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a list of P tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension, representing sharded embedding tensors. Alternatively, a `PartitionedVariable`, created by partitioning along dimension 0. Each element must be appropriately sized for the given `partition_strategy`.   
`ids` |  A `Tensor` or a 'RaggedTensor' with type `int32` or `int64` containing the ids to be looked up in `params`.   
`partition_strategy` |  A string specifying the partitioning strategy, relevant if `len(params) > 1`. Currently `"div"` and `"mod"` are supported. Default is `"mod"`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
`validate_indices` |  DEPRECATED. If this operation is assigned to CPU, values in `indices` are always validated to be within range. If assigned to GPU, out-of-bound indices result in safe but unspecified behavior, which may include raising an error.   
`max_norm` |  If not `None`, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger than this value.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` or a 'RaggedTensor', depending on the input, with the same type as
the tensors in `params`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `params` is empty.
