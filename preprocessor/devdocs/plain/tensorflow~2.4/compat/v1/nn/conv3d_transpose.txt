# tf.compat.v1.nn.conv3d_transpose

The transpose of `conv3d`.

    
    tf.compat.v1.nn.conv3d_transpose(
        value, filter=None, output_shape=None, strides=None, padding='SAME',
        data_format='NDHWC', name=None, input=None, filters=None,
        dilations=None
    )
    
This operation is sometimes called "deconvolution" after (Zeiler et al.,
2010), but is really the transpose (gradient) of `conv3d` rather than an
actual deconvolution.

Args  
---  
`value` |  A 5-D `Tensor` of type `float` and shape `[batch, depth, height, width, in_channels]`.   
`filter` |  A 5-D `Tensor` with the same type as `value` and shape `[depth, height, width, output_channels, in_channels]`. `filter`'s `in_channels` dimension must match that of `value`.   
`output_shape` |  A 1-D `Tensor` representing the output shape of the deconvolution op.   
`strides` |  A list of ints. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of the input tensor.   
`padding` |  A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See the "returns" section of `tf.nn.convolution` for details.   
`data_format` |  A string, either `'NDHWC'` or `'NCDHW`' specifying the layout of the input and output tensors. Defaults to `'NDHWC'`.   
`name` |  Optional name for the returned tensor.   
`input` |  Alias of value.   
`filters` |  Alias of filter.   
`dilations` |  An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `3` or `5`, defaults to 1. The dilation factor for each dimension of`input`. If a single value is given it is replicated in the `D`, `H` and `W` dimension. By default the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 1. If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`, see above for details. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions if a 5-d tensor must be 1.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If input/output depth does not match `filter`'s shape, or if padding is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.
