# tf.compat.v1.nn.erosion2d

Computes the grayscale erosion of 4-D `value` and 3-D `kernel` tensors.

    
    tf.compat.v1.nn.erosion2d(
        value, kernel, strides, rates, padding, name=None
    )
    
The `value` tensor has shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, depth]` and the
`kernel` tensor has shape `[kernel_height, kernel_width, depth]`, i.e., each
input channel is processed independently of the others with its own
structuring function. The `output` tensor has shape `[batch, out_height,
out_width, depth]`. The spatial dimensions of the output tensor depend on the
`padding` algorithm. We currently only support the default "NHWC"
`data_format`.

In detail, the grayscale morphological 2-D erosion is given by:

    
    output[b, y, x, c] =
       min_{dy, dx} value[b,
                          strides[1] * y - rates[1] * dy,
                          strides[2] * x - rates[2] * dx,
                          c] -
                    kernel[dy, dx, c]
    
Duality: The erosion of `value` by the `kernel` is equal to the negation of
the dilation of `-value` by the reflected `kernel`.

Args  
---  
`value` |  A `Tensor`. 4-D with shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, depth]`.   
`kernel` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `value`. 3-D with shape `[kernel_height, kernel_width, depth]`.   
`strides` |  A list of `ints` that has length `>= 4`. 1-D of length 4. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of the input tensor. Must be: `[1, stride_height, stride_width, 1]`.   
`rates` |  A list of `ints` that has length `>= 4`. 1-D of length 4. The input stride for atrous morphological dilation. Must be: `[1, rate_height, rate_width, 1]`.   
`padding` |  A `string` from: `"SAME", "VALID"`. The type of padding algorithm to use.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional). If not specified "erosion2d" is used.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `value`. 4-D with shape `[batch, out_height,
out_width, depth]`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the `value` depth does not match `kernel`' shape, or if padding is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.
