# tf.compat.v1.nn.crelu

Computes Concatenated ReLU.

    
    tf.compat.v1.nn.crelu(
        features, name=None, axis=-1
    )
    
Concatenates a ReLU which selects only the positive part of the activation
with a ReLU which selects only the negative part of the activation. Note that
as a result this non-linearity doubles the depth of the activations. Source:

Args  
---  
`features` |  A `Tensor` with type `float`, `double`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `int16`, or `int8`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
`axis` |  The axis that the output values are concatenated along. Default is -1.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same type as `features`.
