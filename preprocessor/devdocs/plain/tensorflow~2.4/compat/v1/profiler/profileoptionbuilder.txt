# tf.compat.v1.profiler.ProfileOptionBuilder

Option Builder for Profiling API.

    
    tf.compat.v1.profiler.ProfileOptionBuilder(
        options=None
    )
    
For tutorial on the options, see
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/core/profiler/g3doc/options.md

    
    # Users can use pre-built options:
    opts = (
        tf.profiler.ProfileOptionBuilder.trainable_variables_parameter())
    
    # Or, build your own options:
    opts = (tf.compat.v1.profiler.ProfileOptionBuilder()
        .with_max_depth(10)
        .with_min_micros(1000)
        .select(['accelerator_micros'])
        .with_stdout_output()
        .build()
    
    # Or customize the pre-built options:
    opts = (tf.compat.v1.profiler.ProfileOptionBuilder(
        tf.profiler.ProfileOptionBuilder.time_and_memory())
        .with_displaying_options(show_name_regexes=['.*rnn.*'])
        .build())
    
    # Finally, profiling with the options:
    _ = tf.compat.v1.profiler.profile(tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph(),
                            run_meta=run_meta,
                            cmd='scope',

## Methods

### `account_displayed_op_only`

View source

    
    account_displayed_op_only(
        is_true

### `trainable_variables_parameter`

View source

    
    @staticmethod

### `with_accounted_types`

View source

    
    with_accounted_types(
        account_type_regexes
    )
    
Selectively counting statistics based on node types.

Here, 'types' means the profiler nodes' properties. Profiler by default
consider device name (e.g. /job:xx/.../device:GPU:0) and operation type (e.g.
MatMul) as profiler nodes' properties. User can also associate customized
'types' to profiler nodes through OpLogProto proto.

For example, user can select profiler nodes placed on gpu:0 with:
`account_type_regexes=['.*gpu:0.*']`

If none of a node's properties match the specified regexes, the node is not
displayed nor accounted.

Args  
---  
`account_type_regexes` |  A list of regexes specifying the types.   
Returns  
---  
self.

View source

    
    with_max_depth(
        max_depth
    )

        min_occurrence
    )

A "node" means a profiler output node, which can be a python line (code view),
an operation type (op view), or a graph node (graph/scope view). A python line
includes all graph nodes created by that line, while an operation type
includes all graph nodes of that type.

Args  
---  
`min_occurrence` |  Only show nodes including no less than this.

self  
### `with_min_parameters`

View source

    
    with_min_parameters(
        min_params
    )
    
Only show profiler nodes holding no less than 'min_params' parameters.

'Parameters' normally refers the weights of in TensorFlow variables. It
reflects the 'capacity' of models.

Args  
---  
`min_params` |  Only show profiler nodes holding number parameters no less than this.   
Returns  
---  
self  
### `with_node_names`

View source

        start_name_regexes=None, show_name_regexes=None, hide_name_regexes=None,
        trim_name_regexes=None
    )
    
Regular expressions used to select profiler nodes to display.

After 'with_accounted_types' is evaluated, 'with_node_names' are evaluated as
follows:

For a profile data structure, profiler first finds the profiler nodes matching
'start_name_regexes', and starts displaying profiler nodes from there. Then,
if a node matches 'show_name_regexes' and doesn't match 'hide_name_regexes',
it's displayed. If a node matches 'trim_name_regexes', profiler stops further
searching that branch.

Args  
---  
`start_name_regexes` |  list of node name regexes to start displaying.   
`show_name_regexes` |  list of node names regexes to display.   
`hide_name_regexes` |  list of node_names regexes that should be hidden.   
`trim_name_regexes` |  list of node name regexes from where to stop.   
Returns  
---  
self
