# tf.compat.v1.constant

Creates a constant tensor.

    
    tf.compat.v1.constant(
        value, dtype=None, shape=None, name='Const', verify_shape=False
    )
    
The resulting tensor is populated with values of type `dtype`, as specified by
arguments `value` and (optionally) `shape` (see examples below).

The argument `value` can be a constant value, or a list of values of type
`dtype`. If `value` is a list, then the length of the list must be less than
or equal to the number of elements implied by the `shape` argument (if
specified). In the case where the list length is less than the number of
elements specified by `shape`, the last element in the list will be used to
fill the remaining entries.

The argument `shape` is optional. If present, it specifies the dimensions of
the resulting tensor. If not present, the shape of `value` is used.

If the argument `dtype` is not specified, then the type is inferred from the
type of `value`.

#### For example:

    
    # Constant 1-D Tensor populated with value list.
    tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) => [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
    
    # Constant 2-D tensor populated with scalar value -1.
    tensor = tf.constant(-1.0, shape=[2, 3]) => [[-1. -1. -1.]
                                                 [-1. -1. -1.]]
    
`tf.constant` differs from `tf.fill` in a few ways:

  * `tf.constant` supports arbitrary constants, not just uniform scalar Tensors like `tf.fill`.
  * `tf.constant` creates a `Const` node in the computation graph with the exact value at graph construction time. On the other hand, `tf.fill` creates an Op in the graph that is expanded at runtime.
  * Because `tf.constant` only embeds constant values in the graph, it does not support dynamic shapes based on other runtime Tensors, whereas `tf.fill` does.
