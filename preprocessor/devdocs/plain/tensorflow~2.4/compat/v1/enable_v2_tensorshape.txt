# tf.compat.v1.enable_v2_tensorshape

In TensorFlow 2.0, iterating over a TensorShape instance returns values.

    
    tf.compat.v1.enable_v2_tensorshape()
    
This enables the new behavior.

Concretely, `tensor_shape[i]` returned a Dimension instance in V1, but it V2
it returns either an integer, or None.

#### Examples:

    
    #######################
    # If you had this in V1:
    value = tensor_shape[i].value
    
    # Do this in V2 instead:
    value = tensor_shape[i]
    
    #######################
    # If you had this in V1:
    for dim in tensor_shape:
      value = dim.value
      print(value)
    
    # Do this in V2 instead:
    for value in tensor_shape:
      print(value)
    
    #######################
    # If you had this in V1:
    dim = tensor_shape[i]
    dim.assert_is_compatible_with(other_shape)  # or using any other shape method
    
    # Do this in V2 instead:
    if tensor_shape.rank is None:
      dim = Dimension(None)
    else:
      dim = tensor_shape.dims[i]
    dim.assert_is_compatible_with(other_shape)  # or using any other shape method
    
    # The V2 suggestion above is more explicit, which will save you from
    # the following trap (present in V1):
    # you might do in-place modifications to `dim` and expect them to be reflected
    # in `tensor_shape[i]`, but they would not be.
