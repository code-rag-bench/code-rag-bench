# tf.compat.v1.clip_by_average_norm

Clips tensor values to a maximum average L2-norm. (deprecated)

    
    tf.compat.v1.clip_by_average_norm(
        t, clip_norm, name=None
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: clip_by_average_norm is deprecated in TensorFlow
2.0. Please use clip_by_norm(t, clip_norm * tf.cast(tf.size(t), tf.float32),
name) instead.

Given a tensor `t`, and a maximum clip value `clip_norm`, this operation
normalizes `t` so that its average L2-norm is less than or equal to
`clip_norm`. Specifically, if the average L2-norm is already less than or
equal to `clip_norm`, then `t` is not modified. If the average L2-norm is
greater than `clip_norm`, then this operation returns a tensor of the same
type and shape as `t` with its values set to:

`t * clip_norm / l2norm_avg(t)`

In this case, the average L2-norm of the output tensor is `clip_norm`.

This operation is typically used to clip gradients before applying them with
an optimizer.

Args  
---  
`t` |  A `Tensor`.   
`clip_norm` |  A 0-D (scalar) `Tensor` > 0\. A maximum clipping value.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A clipped `Tensor`.
