# tf.compat.v1.assign

Update `ref` by assigning `value` to it.

    
    tf.compat.v1.assign(
        ref, value, validate_shape=None, use_locking=None, name=None
    )
    
This operation outputs a Tensor that holds the new value of `ref` after the
value has been assigned. This makes it easier to chain operations that need to
use the reset value.

Args  
---  
`ref` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Should be from a `Variable` node. May be uninitialized.   
`value` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same shape and dtype as `ref`. The value to be assigned to the variable.   
`validate_shape` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. If true, the operation will validate that the shape of 'value' matches the shape of the Tensor being assigned to. If false, 'ref' will take on the shape of 'value'.   
`use_locking` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. If True, the assignment will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` that will hold the new value of `ref` after the assignment has
completed.
