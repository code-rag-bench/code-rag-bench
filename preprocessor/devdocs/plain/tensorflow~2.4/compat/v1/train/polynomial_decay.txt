# tf.compat.v1.train.polynomial_decay

Applies a polynomial decay to the learning rate.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.polynomial_decay(
        learning_rate, global_step, decay_steps, end_learning_rate=0.0001, power=1.0,
        cycle=False, name=None
    )
    
It is commonly observed that a monotonically decreasing learning rate, whose
degree of change is carefully chosen, results in a better performing model.
This function applies a polynomial decay function to a provided initial
`learning_rate` to reach an `end_learning_rate` in the given `decay_steps`.

It requires a `global_step` value to compute the decayed learning rate. You
can just pass a TensorFlow variable that you increment at each training step.

The function returns the decayed learning rate. It is computed as:

    
    global_step = min(global_step, decay_steps)
    decayed_learning_rate = (learning_rate - end_learning_rate) *
                            (1 - global_step / decay_steps) ^ (power) +
                            end_learning_rate
    
    
If `cycle` is True then a multiple of `decay_steps` is used, the first one
that is bigger than `global_steps`.

    
    decay_steps = decay_steps * ceil(global_step / decay_steps)
    decayed_learning_rate = (learning_rate - end_learning_rate) *
                            (1 - global_step / decay_steps) ^ (power) +
                            end_learning_rate
    
    
Example: decay from 0.1 to 0.01 in 10000 steps using sqrt (i.e. power=0.5):

    
    ...
    global_step = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False)
    starter_learning_rate = 0.1
    end_learning_rate = 0.01
    decay_steps = 10000
    learning_rate = tf.compat.v1.train.polynomial_decay(starter_learning_rate,
    global_step,
                                              decay_steps, end_learning_rate,
                                              power=0.5)
    # Passing global_step to minimize() will increment it at each step.
    learning_step = (
        tf.compat.v1.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate)
        .minimize(...my loss..., global_step=global_step)
    )
    
Args  
---  
`learning_rate` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a Python number. The initial learning rate.   
`global_step` |  A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Global step to use for the decay computation. Must not be negative.   
`decay_steps` |  A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Must be positive. See the decay computation above.   
`end_learning_rate` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a Python number. The minimal end learning rate.   
`power` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a Python number. The power of the polynomial. Defaults to linear, 1.0.   
`cycle` |  A boolean, whether or not it should cycle beyond decay_steps.   
`name` |  String. Optional name of the operation. Defaults to 'PolynomialDecay'.   
Returns  
---  
A scalar `Tensor` of the same type as `learning_rate`. The decayed learning
rate.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if `global_step` is not supplied.   
#### Eager Compatibility

When eager execution is enabled, this function returns a function which in
turn returns the decayed learning rate Tensor. This can be useful for changing
the learning rate value across different invocations of optimizer functions.
