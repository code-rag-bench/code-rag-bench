# tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer

Base class for optimizers.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer(
        use_locking, name
    )
    
This class defines the API to add Ops to train a model. You never use this
class directly, but instead instantiate one of its subclasses such as
`GradientDescentOptimizer`, `AdagradOptimizer`, or `MomentumOptimizer`.

### Usage

    
    # Create an optimizer with the desired parameters.
    opt = GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.1)
    # Add Ops to the graph to minimize a cost by updating a list of variables.
    # "cost" is a Tensor, and the list of variables contains tf.Variable
    # objects.
    opt_op = opt.minimize(cost, var_list=<list of variables>)
    
In the training program you will just have to run the returned Op.

    
    # Execute opt_op to do one step of training:
    opt_op.run()
    
### Processing gradients before applying them.

Calling `minimize()` takes care of both computing the gradients and applying
them to the variables. If you want to process the gradients before applying
them you can instead use the optimizer in three steps:

  1. Compute the gradients with `compute_gradients()`.
  2. Process the gradients as you wish.
  3. Apply the processed gradients with `apply_gradients()`.

#### Example:

    
    # Create an optimizer.
    opt = GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=0.1)
    
    # Compute the gradients for a list of variables.
    grads_and_vars = opt.compute_gradients(loss, <list of variables>)
    
    # grads_and_vars is a list of tuples (gradient, variable).  Do whatever you
    # need to the 'gradient' part, for example cap them, etc.
    capped_grads_and_vars = [(MyCapper(gv[0]), gv[1]) for gv in grads_and_vars]
    
    # Ask the optimizer to apply the capped gradients.
    opt.apply_gradients(capped_grads_and_vars)
    
### Gating Gradients

Both `minimize()` and `compute_gradients()` accept a `gate_gradients` argument
that controls the degree of parallelism during the application of the
gradients.

The possible values are: `GATE_NONE`, `GATE_OP`, and `GATE_GRAPH`.

`GATE_NONE`: Compute and apply gradients in parallel. This provides the
maximum parallelism in execution, at the cost of some non-reproducibility in
the results. For example the two gradients of `matmul` depend on the input
values: With `GATE_NONE` one of the gradients could be applied to one of the
inputs before the other gradient is computed resulting in non-reproducible
results.

`GATE_OP`: For each Op, make sure all gradients are computed before they are
used. This prevents race conditions for Ops that generate gradients for
multiple inputs where the gradients depend on the inputs.

`GATE_GRAPH`: Make sure all gradients for all variables are computed before
any one of them is used. This provides the least parallelism but can be useful
if you want to process all gradients before applying any of them.

### Slots

Some optimizer subclasses, such as `MomentumOptimizer` and `AdagradOptimizer`
allocate and manage additional variables associated with the variables to
train. These are called Slots. Slots have names and you can ask the optimizer
for the names of the slots that it uses. Once you have a slot name you can ask
the optimizer for the variable it created to hold the slot value.

This can be useful if you want to log debug a training algorithm, report stats
about the slots, etc.

Args  
---  
`use_locking` |  Bool. If True apply use locks to prevent concurrent updates to variables.   
`name` |  A non-empty string. The name to use for accumulators created for the optimizer.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If name is malformed.   
## Methods

### `apply_gradients`

View source

    
    apply_gradients(
        grads_and_vars, global_step=None, name=None
    )
    
Apply gradients to variables.

This is the second part of `minimize()`. It returns an `Operation` that
applies gradients.

Args  
---  
`grads_and_vars` |  List of (gradient, variable) pairs as returned by `compute_gradients()`.   
`global_step` |  Optional `Variable` to increment by one after the variables have been updated.   
`name` |  Optional name for the returned operation. Default to the name passed to the `Optimizer` constructor.   
Returns  
---  
An `Operation` that applies the specified gradients. If `global_step` was not
None, that operation also increments `global_step`.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `grads_and_vars` is malformed.   
`ValueError` |  If none of the variables have gradients.   
`RuntimeError` |  If you should use `_distributed_apply()` instead.   
### `compute_gradients`

View source

    
    compute_gradients(
        loss, var_list=None, gate_gradients=GATE_OP, aggregation_method=None,
        colocate_gradients_with_ops=False, grad_loss=None
    )
    
Compute gradients of `loss` for the variables in `var_list`.

This is the first part of `minimize()`. It returns a list of (gradient,
variable) pairs where "gradient" is the gradient for "variable". Note that
"gradient" can be a `Tensor`, an `IndexedSlices`, or `None` if there is no
gradient for the given variable.

Args  
---  
`loss` |  A Tensor containing the value to minimize or a callable taking no arguments which returns the value to minimize. When eager execution is enabled it must be a callable.   
`var_list` |  Optional list or tuple of `tf.Variable` to update to minimize `loss`. Defaults to the list of variables collected in the graph under the key `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`.   
`gate_gradients` |  How to gate the computation of gradients. Can be `GATE_NONE`, `GATE_OP`, or `GATE_GRAPH`.   
`aggregation_method` |  Specifies the method used to combine gradient terms. Valid values are defined in the class `AggregationMethod`.   
`colocate_gradients_with_ops` |  If True, try colocating gradients with the corresponding op.   
`grad_loss` |  Optional. A `Tensor` holding the gradient computed for `loss`.   
Returns  
---  
A list of (gradient, variable) pairs. Variable is always present, but gradient
can be `None`.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `var_list` contains anything else than `Variable` objects.   
`ValueError` |  If some arguments are invalid.   
`RuntimeError` |  If called with eager execution enabled and `loss` is not callable.   
#### Eager Compatibility

When eager execution is enabled, `gate_gradients`, `aggregation_method`, and
`colocate_gradients_with_ops` are ignored.

### `get_name`

View source

    
    get_name()
    
### `get_slot`

View source

    
    get_slot(
        var, name
    )
    
Return a slot named `name` created for `var` by the Optimizer.

Some `Optimizer` subclasses use additional variables. For example `Momentum`
and `Adagrad` use variables to accumulate updates. This method gives access to
these `Variable` objects if for some reason you need them.

Use `get_slot_names()` to get the list of slot names created by the
`Optimizer`.

Args  
---  
`var` |  A variable passed to `minimize()` or `apply_gradients()`.   
`name` |  A string.   
Returns  
---  
The `Variable` for the slot if it was created, `None` otherwise.  
### `get_slot_names`

View source

    
    get_slot_names()
    
Return a list of the names of slots created by the `Optimizer`.

See `get_slot()`.

Returns  
---  
A list of strings.  
### `minimize`

View source

    
    minimize(
        loss, global_step=None, var_list=None, gate_gradients=GATE_OP,
        aggregation_method=None, colocate_gradients_with_ops=False, name=None,
        grad_loss=None
    )
    
Add operations to minimize `loss` by updating `var_list`.

This method simply combines calls `compute_gradients()` and
`apply_gradients()`. If you want to process the gradient before applying them
call `compute_gradients()` and `apply_gradients()` explicitly instead of using
this function.

Args  
---  
`loss` |  A `Tensor` containing the value to minimize.   
`global_step` |  Optional `Variable` to increment by one after the variables have been updated.   
`var_list` |  Optional list or tuple of `Variable` objects to update to minimize `loss`. Defaults to the list of variables collected in the graph under the key `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`.   
`gate_gradients` |  How to gate the computation of gradients. Can be `GATE_NONE`, `GATE_OP`, or `GATE_GRAPH`.   
`aggregation_method` |  Specifies the method used to combine gradient terms. Valid values are defined in the class `AggregationMethod`.   
`colocate_gradients_with_ops` |  If True, try colocating gradients with the corresponding op.   
`name` |  Optional name for the returned operation.   
`grad_loss` |  Optional. A `Tensor` holding the gradient computed for `loss`.   
Returns  
---  
An Operation that updates the variables in `var_list`. If `global_step` was
not `None`, that operation also increments `global_step`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If some of the variables are not `Variable` objects.   
#### Eager Compatibility

When eager execution is enabled, `loss` should be a Python function that takes
no arguments and computes the value to be minimized. Minimization (and
gradient computation) is done with respect to the elements of `var_list` if
not None, else with respect to any trainable variables created during the
execution of the `loss` function. `gate_gradients`, `aggregation_method`,
`colocate_gradients_with_ops` and `grad_loss` are ignored when eager execution
is enabled.

### `variables`

View source

    
    variables()
    
A list of variables which encode the current state of `Optimizer`.

Includes slot variables and additional global variables created by the
optimizer in the current default graph.

Returns  
---  
A list of variables.  
Class Variables

GATE_GRAPH  |  `2`  
GATE_NONE  |  `0`  
GATE_OP  |  `1`
