# tf.compat.v1.train.inverse_time_decay

Applies inverse time decay to the initial learning rate.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.inverse_time_decay(
        learning_rate, global_step, decay_steps, decay_rate, staircase=False, name=None
    )
    
When training a model, it is often recommended to lower the learning rate as
the training progresses. This function applies an inverse decay function to a
provided initial learning rate. It requires an `global_step` value to compute
the decayed learning rate. You can just pass a TensorFlow variable that you
increment at each training step.

The function returns the decayed learning rate. It is computed as:

    
    decayed_learning_rate = learning_rate / (1 + decay_rate * global_step /
    decay_step)
    
or, if `staircase` is `True`, as:

    
    decayed_learning_rate = learning_rate / (1 + decay_rate * floor(global_step /
    decay_step))
    
Example: decay 1/t with a rate of 0.5:

    
    ...
    global_step = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False)
    learning_rate = 0.1
    decay_steps = 1.0
    decay_rate = 0.5
    learning_rate = tf.compat.v1.train.inverse_time_decay(learning_rate,
    global_step,
    decay_steps, decay_rate)
    
    # Passing global_step to minimize() will increment it at each step.
    learning_step = (
        tf.compat.v1.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate)
        .minimize(...my loss..., global_step=global_step)
    )
    
Args  
---  
`learning_rate` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a Python number. The initial learning rate.   
`global_step` |  A Python number. Global step to use for the decay computation. Must not be negative.   
`decay_steps` |  How often to apply decay.   
`decay_rate` |  A Python number. The decay rate.   
`staircase` |  Whether to apply decay in a discrete staircase, as opposed to continuous, fashion.   
`name` |  String. Optional name of the operation. Defaults to 'InverseTimeDecay'.   
Returns  
---  
A scalar `Tensor` of the same type as `learning_rate`. The decayed learning
rate.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if `global_step` is not supplied.   
#### Eager Compatibility

When eager execution is enabled, this function returns a function which in
turn returns the decayed learning rate Tensor. This can be useful for changing
the learning rate value across different invocations of optimizer functions.
