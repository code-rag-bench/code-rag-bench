# tf.compat.v1.train.replica_device_setter

Return a `device function` to use when building a Graph for replicas.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.replica_device_setter(
        ps_tasks=0, ps_device='/job:ps',
        worker_device='/job:worker', merge_devices=True, cluster=None,
        ps_ops=None, ps_strategy=None
    )
    
Device Functions are used in `with tf.device(device_function):` statement to
automatically assign devices to `Operation` objects as they are constructed,
Device constraints are added from the inner-most context first, working
outwards. The merging behavior adds constraints to fields that are yet unset
by a more inner context. Currently the fields are (job, task, cpu/gpu).

If `cluster` is `None`, and `ps_tasks` is 0, the returned function is a no-op.
Otherwise, the value of `ps_tasks` is derived from `cluster`.

By default, only Variable ops are placed on ps tasks, and the placement
strategy is round-robin over all ps tasks. A custom `ps_strategy` may be used
to do more intelligent placement, such as
`tf.contrib.training.GreedyLoadBalancingStrategy`.

For example,

    
    # To build a cluster with two ps jobs on hosts ps0 and ps1, and 3 worker
    # jobs on hosts worker0, worker1 and worker2.
    cluster_spec = {
        "ps": ["ps0:2222", "ps1:2222"],
        "worker": ["worker0:2222", "worker1:2222", "worker2:2222"]}
    with
    tf.device(tf.compat.v1.train.replica_device_setter(cluster=cluster_spec)):
      # Build your graph
      v1 = tf.Variable(...)  # assigned to /job:ps/task:0
      v2 = tf.Variable(...)  # assigned to /job:ps/task:1
      v3 = tf.Variable(...)  # assigned to /job:ps/task:0
    # Run compute
    
Args  
---  
`ps_tasks` |  Number of tasks in the `ps` job. Ignored if `cluster` is provided.   
`ps_device` |  String. Device of the `ps` job. If empty no `ps` job is used. Defaults to `ps`.   
`worker_device` |  String. Device of the `worker` job. If empty no `worker` job is used.   
`merge_devices` |  `Boolean`. If `True`, merges or only sets a device if the device constraint is completely unset. merges device specification rather than overriding them.   
`cluster` |  `ClusterDef` proto or `ClusterSpec`.   
`ps_ops` |  List of strings representing `Operation` types that need to be placed on `ps` devices. If `None`, defaults to `STANDARD_PS_OPS`.   
`ps_strategy` |  A callable invoked for every ps `Operation` (i.e. matched by `ps_ops`), that takes the `Operation` and returns the ps task index to use. If `None`, defaults to a round-robin strategy across all `ps` devices.   
Returns  
---  
A function to pass to `tf.device()`.  
Raises  
---  
TypeError if `cluster` is not a dictionary or `ClusterDef` protocol buffer, or
if `ps_strategy` is provided but not a callable.
