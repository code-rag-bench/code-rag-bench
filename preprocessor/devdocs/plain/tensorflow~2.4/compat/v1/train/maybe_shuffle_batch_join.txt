# tf.compat.v1.train.maybe_shuffle_batch_join

Create batches by randomly shuffling conditionally-enqueued tensors.
(deprecated)

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.maybe_shuffle_batch_join(
        tensors_list, batch_size, capacity, min_after_dequeue, keep_input, seed=None,
        enqueue_many=False, shapes=None, allow_smaller_final_batch=False,
        shared_name=None, name=None
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: Queue-based input pipelines have been replaced by
`tf.data`. Use
`tf.data.Dataset.interleave(...).filter(...).shuffle(min_after_dequeue).batch(batch_size)`.

See docstring in `shuffle_batch_join` for more details.

Args  
---  
`tensors_list` |  A list of tuples or dictionaries of tensors to enqueue.   
`batch_size` |  An integer. The new batch size pulled from the queue.   
`capacity` |  An integer. The maximum number of elements in the queue.   
`min_after_dequeue` |  Minimum number elements in the queue after a dequeue, used to ensure a level of mixing of elements.   
`keep_input` |  A `bool` Tensor. This tensor controls whether the input is added to the queue or not. If it is a scalar and evaluates `True`, then `tensors` are all added to the queue. If it is a vector and `enqueue_many` is `True`, then each example is added to the queue only if the corresponding value in `keep_input` is `True`. This tensor essentially acts as a filtering mechanism.   
`seed` |  Seed for the random shuffling within the queue.   
`enqueue_many` |  Whether each tensor in `tensor_list_list` is a single example.   
`shapes` |  (Optional) The shapes for each example. Defaults to the inferred shapes for `tensors_list[i]`.   
`allow_smaller_final_batch` |  (Optional) Boolean. If `True`, allow the final batch to be smaller if there are insufficient items left in the queue.   
`shared_name` |  (optional). If set, this queue will be shared under the given name across multiple sessions.   
`name` |  (Optional) A name for the operations.   
Returns  
---  
A list or dictionary of tensors with the same number and types as
`tensors_list[i]`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the `shapes` are not specified, and cannot be inferred from the elements of `tensors_list`.   
#### Eager Compatibility

Input pipelines based on Queues are not supported when eager execution is
enabled. Please use the `tf.data` API to ingest data under eager execution.
