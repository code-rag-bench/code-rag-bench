# tf.compat.v1.train.export_meta_graph

Returns `MetaGraphDef` proto.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.export_meta_graph(
        filename=None, meta_info_def=None, graph_def=None, saver_def=None,
        collection_list=None, as_text=False, graph=None, export_scope=None,
        clear_devices=False, clear_extraneous_savers=False, strip_default_attrs=False,
        save_debug_info=False, **kwargs
    )
    
Optionally writes it to filename.

This function exports the graph, saver, and collection objects into
`MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer with the intention of it being imported at a
later time or location to restart training, run inference, or be a subgraph.

Args  
---  
`filename` |  Optional filename including the path for writing the generated `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer.   
`meta_info_def` |  `MetaInfoDef` protocol buffer.   
`graph_def` |  `GraphDef` protocol buffer.   
`saver_def` |  `SaverDef` protocol buffer.   
`collection_list` |  List of string keys to collect.   
`as_text` |  If `True`, writes the `MetaGraphDef` as an ASCII proto.   
`graph` |  The `Graph` to export. If `None`, use the default graph.   
`export_scope` |  Optional `string`. Name scope under which to extract the subgraph. The scope name will be striped from the node definitions for easy import later into new name scopes. If `None`, the whole graph is exported. graph_def and export_scope cannot both be specified.   
`clear_devices` |  Whether or not to clear the device field for an `Operation` or `Tensor` during export.   
`clear_extraneous_savers` |  Remove any Saver-related information from the graph (both Save/Restore ops and SaverDefs) that are not associated with the provided SaverDef.   
`strip_default_attrs` |  Boolean. If `True`, default-valued attributes will be removed from the NodeDefs. For a detailed guide, see Stripping Default-Valued Attributes.   
`save_debug_info` |  If `True`, save the GraphDebugInfo to a separate file, which in the same directory of filename and with `_debug` added before the file extend.   
`**kwargs` |  Optional keyed arguments.   
Returns  
---  
A `MetaGraphDef` proto.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  When the `GraphDef` is larger than 2GB.   
`RuntimeError` |  If called with eager execution enabled.   
#### Eager Compatibility

Exporting/importing meta graphs is not supported unless both `graph_def` and
`graph` are provided. No graph exists when eager execution is enabled.
