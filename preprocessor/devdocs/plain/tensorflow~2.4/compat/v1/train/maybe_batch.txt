# tf.compat.v1.train.maybe_batch

Conditionally creates batches of tensors based on `keep_input`. (deprecated)

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.maybe_batch(
        tensors, keep_input, batch_size, num_threads=1, capacity=32, enqueue_many=False,
        shapes=None, dynamic_pad=False, allow_smaller_final_batch=False,
        shared_name=None, name=None
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: Queue-based input pipelines have been replaced by
`tf.data`. Use `tf.data.Dataset.filter(...).batch(batch_size)` (or
`padded_batch(...)` if `dynamic_pad=True`).

See docstring in `batch` for more details.

Args  
---  
`tensors` |  The list or dictionary of tensors to enqueue.   
`keep_input` |  A `bool` Tensor. This tensor controls whether the input is added to the queue or not. If it is a scalar and evaluates `True`, then `tensors` are all added to the queue. If it is a vector and `enqueue_many` is `True`, then each example is added to the queue only if the corresponding value in `keep_input` is `True`. This tensor essentially acts as a filtering mechanism.   
`batch_size` |  The new batch size pulled from the queue.   
`num_threads` |  The number of threads enqueuing `tensors`. The batching will be nondeterministic if `num_threads > 1`.   
`capacity` |  An integer. The maximum number of elements in the queue.   
`enqueue_many` |  Whether each tensor in `tensors` is a single example.   
`shapes` |  (Optional) The shapes for each example. Defaults to the inferred shapes for `tensors`.   
`dynamic_pad` |  Boolean. Allow variable dimensions in input shapes. The given dimensions are padded upon dequeue so that tensors within a batch have the same shapes.   
`allow_smaller_final_batch` |  (Optional) Boolean. If `True`, allow the final batch to be smaller if there are insufficient items left in the queue.   
`shared_name` |  (Optional). If set, this queue will be shared under the given name across multiple sessions.   
`name` |  (Optional) A name for the operations.   
Returns  
---  
A list or dictionary of tensors with the same types as `tensors`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the `shapes` are not specified, and cannot be inferred from the elements of `tensors`.
