# tf.compat.v1.train.shuffle_batch

Creates batches by randomly shuffling tensors. (deprecated)

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.shuffle_batch(
        tensors, batch_size, capacity, min_after_dequeue, num_threads=1, seed=None,
        enqueue_many=False, shapes=None, allow_smaller_final_batch=False,
        shared_name=None, name=None
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: Queue-based input pipelines have been replaced by
`tf.data`. Use `tf.data.Dataset.shuffle(min_after_dequeue).batch(batch_size)`.

This function adds the following to the current `Graph`:

  * A shuffling queue into which tensors from `tensors` are enqueued.
  * A `dequeue_many` operation to create batches from the queue.
  * A `QueueRunner` to `QUEUE_RUNNER` collection, to enqueue the tensors from `tensors`.

If `enqueue_many` is `False`, `tensors` is assumed to represent a single
example. An input tensor with shape `[x, y, z]` will be output as a tensor
with shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.

If `enqueue_many` is `True`, `tensors` is assumed to represent a batch of
examples, where the first dimension is indexed by example, and all members of
`tensors` should have the same size in the first dimension. If an input tensor
has shape `[*, x, y, z]`, the output will have shape `[batch_size, x, y, z]`.

The `capacity` argument controls the how long the prefetching is allowed to
grow the queues.

The returned operation is a dequeue operation and will throw
`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` if the input queue is exhausted. If this operation
is feeding another input queue, its queue runner will catch this exception,
however, if this operation is used in your main thread you are responsible for
catching this yourself.

#### For example:

    
    # Creates batches of 32 images and 32 labels.
    image_batch, label_batch = tf.compat.v1.train.shuffle_batch(
          [single_image, single_label],
          batch_size=32,
          num_threads=4,
          capacity=50000,
          min_after_dequeue=10000)
    
> Note: You must ensure that either (i) the `shapes` argument is passed, or
> (ii) all of the tensors in `tensors` must have fully-defined shapes.
> `ValueError` will be raised if neither of these conditions holds.
If `allow_smaller_final_batch` is `True`, a smaller batch value than
`batch_size` is returned when the queue is closed and there are not enough
elements to fill the batch, otherwise the pending elements are discarded. In
addition, all output tensors' static shapes, as accessed via the `shape`
property will have a first `Dimension` value of `None`, and operations that
depend on fixed batch_size would fail.

Args  
---  
`tensors` |  The list or dictionary of tensors to enqueue.   
`batch_size` |  The new batch size pulled from the queue.   
`capacity` |  An integer. The maximum number of elements in the queue.   
`min_after_dequeue` |  Minimum number elements in the queue after a dequeue, used to ensure a level of mixing of elements.   
`num_threads` |  The number of threads enqueuing `tensor_list`.   
`seed` |  Seed for the random shuffling within the queue.   
`enqueue_many` |  Whether each tensor in `tensor_list` is a single example.   
`shapes` |  (Optional) The shapes for each example. Defaults to the inferred shapes for `tensor_list`.   
`allow_smaller_final_batch` |  (Optional) Boolean. If `True`, allow the final batch to be smaller if there are insufficient items left in the queue.   
`shared_name` |  (Optional) If set, this queue will be shared under the given name across multiple sessions.   
`name` |  (Optional) A name for the operations.   
Returns  
---  
A list or dictionary of tensors with the types as `tensors`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the `shapes` are not specified, and cannot be inferred from the elements of `tensors`.   
#### Eager Compatibility

Input pipelines based on Queues are not supported when eager execution is
enabled. Please use the `tf.data` API to ingest data under eager execution.
