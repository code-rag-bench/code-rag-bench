`tf.compat.v1.train.piecewise_constant_decay`

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.piecewise_constant(
        x, boundaries, values, name=None
    )
    
Example: use a learning rate that's 1.0 for the first 100001 steps, 0.5 for
the next 10000 steps, and 0.1 for any additional steps.

    
    global_step = tf.Variable(0, trainable=False)
    boundaries = [100000, 110000]
    values = [1.0, 0.5, 0.1]
    learning_rate = tf.compat.v1.train.piecewise_constant(global_step, boundaries,
    values)
    
    # Later, whenever we perform an optimization step, we increment global_step.
    
Args  
---  
`x` |  A 0-D scalar `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `uint8`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`.   
`boundaries` |  A list of `Tensor`s or `int`s or `float`s with strictly increasing entries, and with all elements having the same type as `x`.   
`values` |  A list of `Tensor`s or `float`s or `int`s that specifies the values for the intervals defined by `boundaries`. It should have one more element than `boundaries`, and all elements should have the same type.   
`name` |  A string. Optional name of the operation. Defaults to 'PiecewiseConstant'.   
Returns  
---  
A 0-D Tensor. Its value is `values[0]` when `x <= boundaries[0]`, `values[1]`
when `x > boundaries[0]` and `x <= boundaries[1]`, ..., and values[-1] when `x
> boundaries[-1]`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if types of `x` and `boundaries` do not match, or types of all `values` do not match or the number of elements in the lists does not match.   
#### Eager Compatibility

When eager execution is enabled, this function returns a function which in
turn returns the decayed learning rate Tensor. This can be useful for changing
the learning rate value across different invocations of optimizer functions.
