# tf.compat.v1.train.MonitoredSession

Session-like object that handles initialization, recovery and hooks.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.MonitoredSession(
        session_creator=None, hooks=None, stop_grace_period_secs=120
    )
    
#### Example usage:

    
    saver_hook = CheckpointSaverHook(...)
    summary_hook = SummarySaverHook(...)
    with MonitoredSession(session_creator=ChiefSessionCreator(...),
                          hooks=[saver_hook, summary_hook]) as sess:
      while not sess.should_stop():
        sess.run(train_op)
    
Initialization: At creation time the monitored session does following things
in given order:

  * calls `hook.begin()` for each given hook
  * finalizes the graph via `scaffold.finalize()`
  * create session
  * initializes the model via initialization ops provided by `Scaffold`
  * restores variables if a checkpoint exists
  * launches queue runners
  * calls `hook.after_create_session()`

Run: When `run()` is called, the monitored session does following things:

  * calls `hook.before_run()`
  * calls TensorFlow `session.run()` with merged fetches and feed_dict
  * calls `hook.after_run()`
  * returns result of `session.run()` asked by user
  * if `AbortedError` or `UnavailableError` occurs, it recovers or reinitializes the session before executing the run() call again

Exit: At the `close()`, the monitored session does following things in order:

  * calls `hook.end()`
  * closes the queue runners and the session
  * suppresses `OutOfRange` error which indicates that all inputs have been processed if the monitored_session is used as a context

How to set `tf.compat.v1.Session` arguments:

  * In most cases you can set session arguments as follows:

    
    MonitoredSession(
      session_creator=ChiefSessionCreator(master=..., config=...))
    
  * In distributed setting for a non-chief worker, you can use following:

    
    MonitoredSession(
      session_creator=WorkerSessionCreator(master=..., config=...))
    
See `MonitoredTrainingSession` for an example usage based on chief or worker.

> Note: This is not a `tf.compat.v1.Session`. For example, it cannot do
> following:
  * it cannot be set as default session.
  * it cannot be sent to saver.save.
  * it cannot be sent to tf.train.start_queue_runners.

Args  
---  
`session_creator` |  A factory object to create session. Typically a `ChiefSessionCreator` which is the default one.   
`hooks` |  An iterable of `SessionRunHook' objects.   
Returns  
---  
A MonitoredSession object.  
Attributes  
---  
`graph` |  The graph that was launched in this session.   
## Child Classes

`class StepContext`

## Methods

### `close`

View source

    
    close()
    
### `run`

View source

    
    run(
        fetches, feed_dict=None, options=None, run_metadata=None
    )
    
Run ops in the monitored session.

This method is completely compatible with the `tf.Session.run()` method.

Args  
---  
`fetches` |  Same as `tf.Session.run()`.   
`feed_dict` |  Same as `tf.Session.run()`.   
`options` |  Same as `tf.Session.run()`.   
`run_metadata` |  Same as `tf.Session.run()`.   
Returns  
---  
Same as `tf.Session.run()`.  
### `run_step_fn`

View source

    
    run_step_fn(
        step_fn
    )
    
Run ops using a step function.

Args  
---  
`step_fn` |  A function or a method with a single argument of type `StepContext`. The function may use methods of the argument to perform computations with access to a raw session. The returned value of the `step_fn` will be returned from `run_step_fn`, unless a stop is requested. In that case, the next `should_stop` call will return True. Example usage: 
    
    with tf.Graph().as_default():
    c = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(dtypes.float32)
    v = tf.add(c, 4.0)
    w = tf.add(c, 0.5)
    def step_fn(step_context):
    a = step_context.session.run(fetches=v, feed_dict={c: 0.5})
    if a <= 4.5:
    step_context.request_stop()
    return step_context.run_with_hooks(fetches=w,
    feed_dict={c: 0.1})
    
    with tf.MonitoredSession() as session:
    while not session.should_stop():
    a = session.run_step_fn(step_fn)
    
Hooks interact with the `run_with_hooks()` call inside the `step_fn` as they
do with a `MonitoredSession.run` call.  
Returns  
---  
Returns the returned value of `step_fn`.  
Raises  
---  
`StopIteration` |  if `step_fn` has called `request_stop()`. It may be caught by `with tf.MonitoredSession()` to close the session.   
`ValueError` |  if `step_fn` doesn't have a single argument called `step_context`. It may also optionally have `self` for cases when it belongs to an object.   
### `should_stop`
