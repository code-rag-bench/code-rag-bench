# tf.compat.v1.train.generate_checkpoint_state_proto

Generates a checkpoint state proto.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.generate_checkpoint_state_proto(
        save_dir, model_checkpoint_path, all_model_checkpoint_paths=None,
        all_model_checkpoint_timestamps=None, last_preserved_timestamp=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`save_dir` |  Directory where the model was saved.   
`model_checkpoint_path` |  The checkpoint file.   
`all_model_checkpoint_paths` |  List of strings. Paths to all not-yet-deleted checkpoints, sorted from oldest to newest. If this is a non-empty list, the last element must be equal to model_checkpoint_path. These paths are also saved in the CheckpointState proto.   
`all_model_checkpoint_timestamps` |  A list of floats, indicating the number of seconds since the Epoch when each checkpoint was generated.   
`last_preserved_timestamp` |  A float, indicating the number of seconds since the Epoch when the last preserved checkpoint was written, e.g. due to a `keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours` parameter (see `tf.train.CheckpointManager` for an implementation).   
Returns  
---  
CheckpointState proto with model_checkpoint_path and
all_model_checkpoint_paths updated to either absolute paths or relative paths
to the current save_dir.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `all_model_checkpoint_timestamps` was provided but its length does not match `all_model_checkpoint_paths`.
