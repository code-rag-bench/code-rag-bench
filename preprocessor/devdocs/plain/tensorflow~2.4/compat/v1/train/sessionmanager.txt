# tf.compat.v1.train.SessionManager

Training helper that restores from checkpoint and creates session.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.SessionManager(
        local_init_op=None, ready_op=None, ready_for_local_init_op=None, graph=None,
        recovery_wait_secs=30, local_init_run_options=None, local_init_feed_dict=None
    )
    
This class is a small wrapper that takes care of session creation and
checkpoint recovery. It also provides functions that to facilitate
coordination among multiple training threads or processes.

  * Checkpointing trained variables as the training progresses.
  * Initializing variables on startup, restoring them from the most recent checkpoint after a crash, or wait for checkpoints to become available.

### Usage:

    
    with tf.Graph().as_default():
       ...add operations to the graph...
      # Create a SessionManager that will checkpoint the model in '/tmp/mydir'.
      sm = SessionManager()
      sess = sm.prepare_session(master, init_op, saver, checkpoint_dir)
      # Use the session to train the graph.
      while True:
        sess.run(<my_train_op>)
    
`prepare_session()` initializes or restores a model. It requires `init_op` and
`saver` as an argument.

A second process could wait for the model to be ready by doing the following:

    
    with tf.Graph().as_default():
       ...add operations to the graph...
      # Create a SessionManager that will wait for the model to become ready.
      sm = SessionManager()
      sess = sm.wait_for_session(master)
      # Use the session to train the graph.
      while True:
        sess.run(<my_train_op>)
    
`wait_for_session()` waits for a model to be initialized by other processes.

Args  
---  
`local_init_op` |  An `Operation` run immediately after session creation. Usually used to initialize tables and local variables.   
`ready_op` |  An `Operation` to check if the model is initialized.   
`ready_for_local_init_op` |  An `Operation` to check if the model is ready to run local_init_op.   
`graph` |  The `Graph` that the model will use.   
`recovery_wait_secs` |  Seconds between checks for the model to be ready.   
`local_init_run_options` |  RunOptions to be passed to session.run when executing the local_init_op.   
`local_init_feed_dict` |  Optional session feed dictionary to use when running the local_init_op.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If ready_for_local_init_op is not None but local_init_op is None   
## Methods

### `prepare_session`

View source

    
    prepare_session(
        master, init_op=None, saver=None, checkpoint_dir=None,
        checkpoint_filename_with_path=None, wait_for_checkpoint=False,
        max_wait_secs=7200, config=None, init_feed_dict=None, init_fn=None
    )
    
Creates a `Session`. Makes sure the model is ready to be used.

Creates a `Session` on 'master'. If a `saver` object is passed in, and
`checkpoint_dir` points to a directory containing valid checkpoint files, then
it will try to recover the model from checkpoint. If no checkpoint files are
available, and `wait_for_checkpoint` is `True`, then the process would check
every `recovery_wait_secs`, up to `max_wait_secs`, for recovery to succeed.

If the model cannot be recovered successfully then it is initialized by
running the `init_op` and calling `init_fn` if they are provided. The
`local_init_op` is also run after init_op and init_fn, regardless of whether
the model was recovered successfully, but only if `ready_for_local_init_op`
passes.

If the model is recovered from a checkpoint it is assumed that all global
variables have been initialized, in particular neither `init_op` nor `init_fn`
will be executed.

It is an error if the model cannot be recovered and no `init_op` or `init_fn`
or `local_init_op` are passed.

Args  
---  
`master` |  `String` representation of the TensorFlow master to use.   
`init_op` |  Optional `Operation` used to initialize the model.   
`saver` |  A `Saver` object used to restore a model.   
`checkpoint_dir` |  Path to the checkpoint files. The latest checkpoint in the dir will be used to restore.   
`checkpoint_filename_with_path` |  Full file name path to the checkpoint file.   
`wait_for_checkpoint` |  Whether to wait for checkpoint to become available.   
`max_wait_secs` |  Maximum time to wait for checkpoints to become available.   
`config` |  Optional `ConfigProto` proto used to configure the session.   
`init_feed_dict` |  Optional dictionary that maps `Tensor` objects to feed values. This feed dictionary is passed to the session `run()` call when running the init op.   
`init_fn` |  Optional callable used to initialize the model. Called after the optional `init_op` is called. The callable must accept one argument, the session being initialized.   
Returns  
---  
A `Session` object that can be used to drive the model.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  If the model cannot be initialized or recovered.   
`ValueError` |  If both checkpoint_dir and checkpoint_filename_with_path are set.   
### `recover_session`

View source

    
    recover_session(
        master, saver=None, checkpoint_dir=None, checkpoint_filename_with_path=None,
        wait_for_checkpoint=False, max_wait_secs=7200, config=None
    )
    
Creates a `Session`, recovering if possible.

Creates a new session on 'master'. If the session is not initialized and can
be recovered from a checkpoint, recover it.

Args  
---  
`master` |  `String` representation of the TensorFlow master to use.   
`saver` |  A `Saver` object used to restore a model.   
`checkpoint_dir` |  Path to the checkpoint files. The latest checkpoint in the dir will be used to restore.   
`checkpoint_filename_with_path` |  Full file name path to the checkpoint file.   
`wait_for_checkpoint` |  Whether to wait for checkpoint to become available.   
`max_wait_secs` |  Maximum time to wait for checkpoints to become available.   
`config` |  Optional `ConfigProto` proto used to configure the session.   
Returns  
---  
A pair (sess, initialized) where 'initialized' is `True` if the session could
be recovered and initialized, `False` otherwise.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If both checkpoint_dir and checkpoint_filename_with_path are set.   
### `wait_for_session`

View source

    
    wait_for_session(
        master, config=None, max_wait_secs=float('Inf')
    )
    
Creates a new `Session` and waits for model to be ready.

Creates a new `Session` on 'master'. Waits for the model to be initialized or
recovered from a checkpoint. It's expected that another thread or process will
make the model ready, and that this is intended to be used by
threads/processes that participate in a distributed training configuration
where a different thread/process is responsible for initializing or recovering
the model being trained.

NB: The amount of time this method waits for the session is bounded by
max_wait_secs. By default, this function will wait indefinitely.

Args  
---  
`master` |  `String` representation of the TensorFlow master to use.   
`config` |  Optional ConfigProto proto used to configure the session.   
`max_wait_secs` |  Maximum time to wait for the session to become available.   
Returns  
---  
A `Session`. May be None if the operation exceeds the timeout specified by
config.operation_timeout_in_ms.  
Raises  
---  
`tf.DeadlineExceededError` |  if the session is not available after max_wait_secs.
