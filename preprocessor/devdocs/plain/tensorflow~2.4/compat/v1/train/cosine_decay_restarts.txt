# tf.compat.v1.train.cosine_decay_restarts

Applies cosine decay with restarts to the learning rate.

    
    tf.compat.v1.train.cosine_decay_restarts(
        learning_rate, global_step, first_decay_steps, t_mul=2.0, m_mul=1.0, alpha=0.0,
        name=None
    )
    
When training a model, it is often recommended to lower the learning rate as
the training progresses. This function applies a cosine decay function with
restarts to a provided initial learning rate. It requires a `global_step`
value to compute the decayed learning rate. You can just pass a TensorFlow
variable that you increment at each training step.

The function returns the decayed learning rate while taking into account
possible warm restarts. The learning rate multiplier first decays from 1 to
`alpha` for `first_decay_steps` steps. Then, a warm restart is performed. Each
new warm restart runs for `t_mul` times more steps and with `m_mul` times
smaller initial learning rate.

#### Example usage:

    
    first_decay_steps = 1000
    lr_decayed = cosine_decay_restarts(learning_rate, global_step,
                                       first_decay_steps)
    
Args  
---  
`learning_rate` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` Tensor or a Python number. The initial learning rate.   
`global_step` |  A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Global step to use for the decay computation.   
`first_decay_steps` |  A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Number of steps to decay over.   
`t_mul` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Used to derive the number of iterations in the i-th period   
`m_mul` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Used to derive the initial learning rate of the i-th period:   
`alpha` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` Tensor or a Python number. Minimum learning rate value as a fraction of the learning_rate.   
`name` |  String. Optional name of the operation. Defaults to 'SGDRDecay'.   
Returns  
---  
A scalar `Tensor` of the same type as `learning_rate`. The decayed learning
rate.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if `global_step` is not supplied.

#### Eager Compatibility

When eager execution is enabled, this function returns a function which in
turn returns the decayed learning rate Tensor. This can be useful for changing
the learning rate value across different invocations of optimizer functions.
