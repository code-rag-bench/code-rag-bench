# tf.compat.v1.setdiff1d

Computes the difference between two lists of numbers or strings.

    
    tf.compat.v1.setdiff1d(
        x, y, index_dtype=tf.dtypes.int32, name=None
    )
    
Given a list `x` and a list `y`, this operation returns a list `out` that
represents all values that are in `x` but not in `y`. The returned list `out`
is sorted in the same order that the numbers appear in `x` (duplicates are
preserved). This operation also returns a list `idx` that represents the
position of each `out` element in `x`. In other words:

`out[i] = x[idx[i]] for i in [0, 1, ..., len(out) - 1]`

For example, given this input:

    
    x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    y = [1, 3, 5]
    
This operation would return:

    
    out ==> [2, 4, 6]
    idx ==> [1, 3, 5]
    
Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`. 1-D. Values to keep.   
`y` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`. 1-D. Values to remove.   
`out_idx` |  An optional `tf.DType` from: `tf.int32, tf.int64`. Defaults to `tf.int32`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (out, idx).  
`out` |  A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.   
`idx` |  A `Tensor` of type `out_idx`.
