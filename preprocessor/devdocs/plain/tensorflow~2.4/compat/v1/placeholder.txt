# tf.compat.v1.placeholder

Inserts a placeholder for a tensor that will be always fed.

    
    tf.compat.v1.placeholder(
        dtype, shape=None, name=None
    )
    
Key Point: This tensor will produce an error if evaluated. Its value must be
fed using the `feed_dict` optional argument to `Session.run()`,
`Tensor.eval()`, or `Operation.run()`.

#### For example:

    
    x = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(1024, 1024))
    y = tf.matmul(x, x)
    
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      print(sess.run(y))  # ERROR: will fail because x was not fed.
    
      rand_array = np.random.rand(1024, 1024)
      print(sess.run(y, feed_dict={x: rand_array}))  # Will succeed.
    
Args  
---  
`dtype` |  The type of elements in the tensor to be fed.   
`shape` |  The shape of the tensor to be fed (optional). If the shape is not specified, you can feed a tensor of any shape.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` that may be used as a handle for feeding a value, but not evaluated
directly.  
Raises  
---  
`RuntimeError` |  if eager execution is enabled   
#### Eager Compatibility

Placeholders are not compatible with eager execution.
