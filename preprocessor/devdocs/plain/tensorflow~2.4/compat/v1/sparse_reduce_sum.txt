This Op takes a SparseTensor and is the sparse counterpart to
`tf.reduce_sum()`. In particular, this Op also returns a dense `Tensor`
instead of a sparse one.

Reduces `sp_input` along the dimensions given in `reduction_axes`. Unless
`keepdims` is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each entry in
`reduction_axes`. If `keepdims` is true, the reduced dimensions are retained
with length 1.

If `reduction_axes` has no entries, all dimensions are reduced, and a tensor
with a single element is returned. Additionally, the axes can be negative,
similar to the indexing rules in Python.

#### For example:

    
    # 'x' represents [[1, ?, 1]
    #                 [?, 1, ?]]
    # where ? is implicitly-zero.
    tf.sparse.reduce_sum(x) ==> 3
    tf.sparse.reduce_sum(x, 0) ==> [1, 1, 1]
    tf.sparse.reduce_sum(x, 1) ==> [2, 1]  # Can also use -1 as the axis.
    tf.sparse.reduce_sum(x, 1, keepdims=True) ==> [[2], [1]]
    tf.sparse.reduce_sum(x, [0, 1]) ==> 3
    
Args  
---  
`sp_input` |  The SparseTensor to reduce. Should have numeric type.   
`axis` |  The dimensions to reduce; list or scalar. If `None` (the default), reduces all dimensions.   
`keepdims` |  If true, retain reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`reduction_axes` |  Deprecated name of `axis`.   
`keep_dims` |  Deprecated alias for `keepdims`.   
Returns  
---  
The reduced Tensor.
