# tf.compat.v1.convert_to_tensor

Converts the given `value` to a `Tensor`.

    
    tf.compat.v1.convert_to_tensor(
        value, dtype=None, name=None, preferred_dtype=None, dtype_hint=None
    )
    
This function converts Python objects of various types to `Tensor` objects. It
accepts `Tensor` objects, numpy arrays, Python lists, and Python scalars. For
example:

    
    import numpy as np
    
    def my_func(arg):
      arg = tf.convert_to_tensor(arg, dtype=tf.float32)
      return tf.matmul(arg, arg) + arg
    
    # The following calls are equivalent.
    value_1 = my_func(tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]))
    value_2 = my_func([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
    value_3 = my_func(np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]], dtype=np.float32))
    
This function can be useful when composing a new operation in Python (such as
`my_func` in the example above). All standard Python op constructors apply
this function to each of their Tensor-valued inputs, which allows those ops to
accept numpy arrays, Python lists, and scalars in addition to `Tensor`
objects.

> Note: This function diverges from default Numpy behavior for `float` and
> `string` types when `None` is present in a Python list or scalar. Rather
> than silently converting `None` values, an error will be thrown.
Args  
---  
`value` |  An object whose type has a registered `Tensor` conversion function.   
`dtype` |  Optional element type for the returned tensor. If missing, the type is inferred from the type of `value`.   
`name` |  Optional name to use if a new `Tensor` is created.   
`preferred_dtype` |  Optional element type for the returned tensor, used when dtype is None. In some cases, a caller may not have a dtype in mind when converting to a tensor, so preferred_dtype can be used as a soft preference. If the conversion to `preferred_dtype` is not possible, this argument has no effect.   
`dtype_hint` |  same meaning as preferred_dtype, and overrides it.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` based on `value`.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If no conversion function is registered for `value` to `dtype`.   
`RuntimeError` |  If a registered conversion function returns an invalid value.   
`ValueError` |  If the `value` is a tensor not of given `dtype` in graph mode.
