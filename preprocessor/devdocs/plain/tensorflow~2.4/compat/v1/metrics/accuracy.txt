# tf.compat.v1.metrics.accuracy

Calculates how often `predictions` matches `labels`.

    
    tf.compat.v1.metrics.accuracy(
        labels, predictions, weights=None, metrics_collections=None,
        updates_collections=None, name=None
    )
    
The `accuracy` function creates two local variables, `total` and `count` that
are used to compute the frequency with which `predictions` matches `labels`.
This frequency is ultimately returned as `accuracy`: an idempotent operation
that simply divides `total` by `count`.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `accuracy`.
Internally, an `is_correct` operation computes a `Tensor` with elements 1.0
where the corresponding elements of `predictions` and `labels` match and 0.0
otherwise. Then `update_op` increments `total` with the reduced sum of the
product of `weights` and `is_correct`, and it increments `count` with the
reduced sum of `weights`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

Args  
---  
`labels` |  The ground truth values, a `Tensor` whose shape matches `predictions`.   
`predictions` |  The predicted values, a `Tensor` of any shape.   
`weights` |  Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).   
`metrics_collections` |  An optional list of collections that `accuracy` should be added to.   
`updates_collections` |  An optional list of collections that `update_op` should be added to.   
`name` |  An optional variable_scope name.   
Returns  
---  
`accuracy` |  A `Tensor` representing the accuracy, the value of `total` divided by `count`.   
`update_op` |  An operation that increments the `total` and `count` variables appropriately and whose value matches `accuracy`.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `predictions` and `labels` have mismatched shapes, or if `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or tuple.   
`RuntimeError` |  If eager execution is enabled.
