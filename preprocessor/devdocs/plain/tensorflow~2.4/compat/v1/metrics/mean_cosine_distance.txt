# tf.compat.v1.metrics.mean_cosine_distance

Computes the cosine distance between the labels and predictions.

    
    tf.compat.v1.metrics.mean_cosine_distance(
        labels, predictions, dim, weights=None, metrics_collections=None,
        updates_collections=None, name=None
    )
    
The `mean_cosine_distance` function creates two local variables, `total` and
`count` that are used to compute the average cosine distance between
`predictions` and `labels`. This average is weighted by `weights`, and it is
ultimately returned as `mean_distance`, which is an idempotent operation that
simply divides `total` by `count`.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`mean_distance`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

Args  
---  
`labels` |  A `Tensor` of arbitrary shape.   
`predictions` |  A `Tensor` of the same shape as `labels`.   
`dim` |  The dimension along which the cosine distance is computed.   
`weights` |  Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension). Also, dimension `dim` must be `1`.   
`metrics_collections` |  An optional list of collections that the metric value variable should be added to.   
`updates_collections` |  An optional list of collections that the metric update ops should be added to.   
`name` |  An optional variable_scope name.   
Returns  
---  
`mean_distance` |  A `Tensor` representing the current mean, the value of `total` divided by `count`.   
`update_op` |  An operation that increments the `total` and `count` variables appropriately.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `predictions` and `labels` have mismatched shapes, or if `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or tuple.   
`RuntimeError` |  If eager execution is enabled.
