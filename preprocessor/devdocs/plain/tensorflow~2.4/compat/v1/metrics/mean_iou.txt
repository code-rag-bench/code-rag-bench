# tf.compat.v1.metrics.mean_iou

Calculate per-step mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIOU).

    
    tf.compat.v1.metrics.mean_iou(
        labels, predictions, num_classes, weights=None, metrics_collections=None,
        updates_collections=None, name=None
    )
    
Mean Intersection-Over-Union is a common evaluation metric for semantic image
segmentation, which first computes the IOU for each semantic class and then
computes the average over classes. IOU is defined as follows: IOU =
true_positive / (true_positive + false_positive + false_negative). The
predictions are accumulated in a confusion matrix, weighted by `weights`, and
mIOU is then calculated from it.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `mean_iou`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

Args  
---  
`labels` |  A `Tensor` of ground truth labels with shape [batch size] and of type `int32` or `int64`. The tensor will be flattened if its rank > 1\.   
`predictions` |  A `Tensor` of prediction results for semantic labels, whose shape is [batch size] and type `int32` or `int64`. The tensor will be flattened if its rank > 1\.   
`num_classes` |  The possible number of labels the prediction task can have. This value must be provided, since a confusion matrix of dimension = [num_classes, num_classes] will be allocated.   
`weights` |  Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).   
`metrics_collections` |  An optional list of collections that `mean_iou` should be added to.   
`updates_collections` |  An optional list of collections `update_op` should be added to.   
`name` |  An optional variable_scope name.   
Returns  
---  
`mean_iou` |  A `Tensor` representing the mean intersection-over-union.   
`update_op` |  An operation that increments the confusion matrix.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `predictions` and `labels` have mismatched shapes, or if `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or tuple.   
`RuntimeError` |  If eager execution is enabled.
