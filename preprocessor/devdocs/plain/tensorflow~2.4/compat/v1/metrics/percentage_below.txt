# tf.compat.v1.metrics.percentage_below

Computes the percentage of values less than the given threshold.

    
    tf.compat.v1.metrics.percentage_below(
        values, threshold, weights=None, metrics_collections=None,
        updates_collections=None, name=None
    )
    
The `percentage_below` function creates two local variables, `total` and
`count` that are used to compute the percentage of `values` that fall below
`threshold`. This rate is weighted by `weights`, and it is ultimately returned
as `percentage` which is an idempotent operation that simply divides `total`
by `count`.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`percentage`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

Args  
---  
`values` |  A numeric `Tensor` of arbitrary size.   
`threshold` |  A scalar threshold.   
`weights` |  Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `values`, and must be broadcastable to `values` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `values` dimension).   
`metrics_collections` |  An optional list of collections that the metric value variable should be added to.   
`updates_collections` |  An optional list of collections that the metric update ops should be added to.   
`name` |  An optional variable_scope name.   
Returns  
---  
`percentage` |  A `Tensor` representing the current mean, the value of `total` divided by `count`.   
`update_op` |  An operation that increments the `total` and `count` variables appropriately.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `values`, or if either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or tuple.   
`RuntimeError` |  If eager execution is enabled.
