# tf.compat.v1.metrics.recall_at_k

Computes recall@k of the predictions with respect to sparse labels.

    
    tf.compat.v1.metrics.recall_at_k(
        labels, predictions, k, class_id=None, weights=None, metrics_collections=None,
        updates_collections=None, name=None
    )
    
If `class_id` is specified, we calculate recall by considering only the
entries in the batch for which `class_id` is in the label, and computing the
fraction of them for which `class_id` is in the top-k `predictions`. If
`class_id` is not specified, we'll calculate recall as how often on average a
class among the labels of a batch entry is in the top-k `predictions`.

`sparse_recall_at_k` creates two local variables, `true_positive_at_<k>` and
`false_negative_at_<k>`, that are used to compute the recall_at_k frequency.
This frequency is ultimately returned as `recall_at_<k>`: an idempotent
operation that simply divides `true_positive_at_<k>` by total
(`true_positive_at_<k>` \+ `false_negative_at_<k>`).

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`recall_at_<k>`. Internally, a `top_k` operation computes a `Tensor`
indicating the top `k` `predictions`. Set operations applied to `top_k` and
`labels` calculate the true positives and false negatives weighted by
`weights`. Then `update_op` increments `true_positive_at_<k>` and
`false_negative_at_<k>` using these values.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

Args  
---  
`labels` |  `int64` `Tensor` or `SparseTensor` with shape [D1, ... DN, num_labels] or [D1, ... DN], where the latter implies num_labels=1. N >= 1 and num_labels is the number of target classes for the associated prediction. Commonly, N=1 and `labels` has shape [batch_size, num_labels]. [D1, ... DN] must match `predictions`. Values should be in range [0, num_classes), where num_classes is the last dimension of `predictions`. Values outside this range always count towards `false_negative_at_<k>`.   
`predictions` |  Float `Tensor` with shape [D1, ... DN, num_classes] where N >= 1. Commonly, N=1 and predictions has shape [batch size, num_classes]. The final dimension contains the logit values for each class. [D1, ... DN] must match `labels`.   
`k` |  Integer, k for @k metric.   
`class_id` |  Integer class ID for which we want binary metrics. This should be in range [0, num_classes), where num_classes is the last dimension of `predictions`. If class_id is outside this range, the method returns NAN.   
`weights` |  `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or n-1, where n is the rank of `labels`. If the latter, it must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).   
`metrics_collections` |  An optional list of collections that values should be added to.   
`updates_collections` |  An optional list of collections that updates should be added to.   
`name` |  Name of new update operation, and namespace for other dependent ops.   
Returns  
---  
`recall` |  Scalar `float64` `Tensor` with the value of `true_positives` divided by the sum of `true_positives` and `false_negatives`.   
`update_op` |  `Operation` that increments `true_positives` and `false_negatives` variables appropriately, and whose value matches `recall`.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or tuple.   
`RuntimeError` |  If eager execution is enabled.
