# tf.compat.v1.metrics.mean_tensor

Computes the element-wise (weighted) mean of the given tensors.

    
    tf.compat.v1.metrics.mean_tensor(
        values, weights=None, metrics_collections=None, updates_collections=None,
        name=None
    )
    
In contrast to the `mean` function which returns a scalar with the mean, this
function returns an average tensor with the same shape as the input tensors.

The `mean_tensor` function creates two local variables, `total_tensor` and
`count_tensor` that are used to compute the average of `values`. This average
is ultimately returned as `mean` which is an idempotent operation that simply
divides `total` by `count`.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `mean`.
`update_op` increments `total` with the reduced sum of the product of `values`
and `weights`, and it increments `count` with the reduced sum of `weights`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

Args  
---  
`values` |  A `Tensor` of arbitrary dimensions.   
`weights` |  Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `values`, and must be broadcastable to `values` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `values` dimension).   
`metrics_collections` |  An optional list of collections that `mean` should be added to.   
`updates_collections` |  An optional list of collections that `update_op` should be added to.   
`name` |  An optional variable_scope name.   
Returns  
---  
`mean` |  A float `Tensor` representing the current mean, the value of `total` divided by `count`.   
`update_op` |  An operation that increments the `total` and `count` variables appropriately and whose value matches `mean_value`.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `values`, or if either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or tuple.   
`RuntimeError` |  If eager execution is enabled.
