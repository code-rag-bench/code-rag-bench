# tf.compat.v1.estimator.experimental.KMeans

An Estimator for K-Means clustering.

Inherits From: `Estimator`

    
    tf.compat.v1.estimator.experimental.KMeans(
        num_clusters, model_dir=None, initial_clusters=RANDOM_INIT,
        distance_metric=SQUARED_EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE, seed=None, use_mini_batch=True,
        mini_batch_steps_per_iteration=1, kmeans_plus_plus_num_retries=2,
        relative_tolerance=None, config=None, feature_columns=None
    )
    
#### Example:

    
    import numpy as np
    import tensorflow as tf
    
    num_points = 100
    dimensions = 2
    points = np.random.uniform(0, 1000, [num_points, dimensions])
    
    def input_fn():
      return tf.compat.v1.train.limit_epochs(
          tf.convert_to_tensor(points, dtype=tf.float32), num_epochs=1)
    
    num_clusters = 5
    kmeans = tf.compat.v1.estimator.experimental.KMeans(
        num_clusters=num_clusters, use_mini_batch=False)
    
    # train
    num_iterations = 10
    previous_centers = None
    for _ in xrange(num_iterations):
      kmeans.train(input_fn)
      cluster_centers = kmeans.cluster_centers()
      if previous_centers is not None:
        print 'delta:', cluster_centers - previous_centers
      previous_centers = cluster_centers
      print 'score:', kmeans.score(input_fn)
    print 'cluster centers:', cluster_centers
    
    # map the input points to their clusters
    cluster_indices = list(kmeans.predict_cluster_index(input_fn))
    for i, point in enumerate(points):
      cluster_index = cluster_indices[i]
      center = cluster_centers[cluster_index]
      print 'point:', point, 'is in cluster', cluster_index, 'centered at', center
    
The `SavedModel` saved by the `export_saved_model` method does not include the
cluster centers. However, the cluster centers may be retrieved by the latest
checkpoint saved during training. Specifically,

    
    kmeans.cluster_centers()
    
is equivalent to

    
    tf.train.load_variable(
        kmeans.model_dir, KMeansClustering.CLUSTER_CENTERS_VAR_NAME)
    
Args  
---  
`num_clusters` |  An integer tensor specifying the number of clusters. This argument is ignored if `initial_clusters` is a tensor or numpy array.   
`model_dir` |  The directory to save the model results and log files.   
`initial_clusters` |  Specifies how the initial cluster centers are chosen. One of the following: * a tensor or numpy array with the initial cluster centers. * a callable `f(inputs, k)` that selects and returns up to `k` centers from an input batch. `f` is free to return any number of centers from `0` to `k`. It will be invoked on successive input batches as necessary until all `num_clusters` centers are chosen. 
  * `KMeansClustering.RANDOM_INIT`: Choose centers randomly from an input batch. If the batch size is less than `num_clusters` then the entire batch is chosen to be initial cluster centers and the remaining centers are chosen from successive input batches.
  * `KMeansClustering.KMEANS_PLUS_PLUS_INIT`: Use kmeans++ to choose centers from the first input batch. If the batch size is less than `num_clusters`, a TensorFlow runtime error occurs. 

  
`distance_metric` |  The distance metric used for clustering. One of: 
* `KMeansClustering.SQUARED_EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE`: Euclidean distance between vectors `u` and `v` is defined as \\(||u - v||_2\\) which is the square root of the sum of the absolute squares of the elements' difference.
* `KMeansClustering.COSINE_DISTANCE`: Cosine distance between vectors `u` and `v` is defined as \\(1 - (u . v) / (||u||_2 ||v||_2)\\).   
`seed` |  Python integer. Seed for PRNG used to initialize centers.   
`use_mini_batch` |  A boolean specifying whether to use the mini-batch k-means algorithm. See explanation above.   
`mini_batch_steps_per_iteration` |  The number of steps after which the updated cluster centers are synced back to a master copy. Used only if `use_mini_batch=True`. See explanation above.   
`kmeans_plus_plus_num_retries` |  For each point that is sampled during kmeans++ initialization, this parameter specifies the number of additional points to draw from the current distribution before selecting the best. If a negative value is specified, a heuristic is used to sample `O(log(num_to_sample))` additional points. Used only if `initial_clusters=KMeansClustering.KMEANS_PLUS_PLUS_INIT`.   
`relative_tolerance` |  A relative tolerance of change in the loss between iterations. Stops learning if the loss changes less than this amount. This may not work correctly if `use_mini_batch=True`.   
`config` |  See `tf.estimator.Estimator`.   
`feature_columns` |  An optionable iterable containing all the feature columns used by the model. All items in the set should be feature column instances that can be passed to `tf.feature_column.input_layer`. If this is None, all features will be used.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  An invalid argument was passed to `initial_clusters` or `distance_metric`.   
Attributes  
---  
`config` |   
`model_dir` |   
`model_fn` |  Returns the `model_fn` which is bound to `self.params`.

## Methods

### `cluster_centers`

View source

    
    cluster_centers()
    
Returns the cluster centers.

### `eval_dir`

View source

    
    eval_dir(
        name=None
    )
    
Shows the directory name where evaluation metrics are dumped.

Args  
---  
`name` |  Name of the evaluation if user needs to run multiple evaluations on different data sets, such as on training data vs test data. Metrics for different evaluations are saved in separate folders, and appear separately in tensorboard.   
Returns  
---  
A string which is the path of directory contains evaluation metrics.  
### `evaluate`

View source

    
    evaluate(
        input_fn, steps=None, hooks=None, checkpoint_path=None, name=None
    )
    
Evaluates the model given evaluation data `input_fn`.

For each step, calls `input_fn`, which returns one batch of data. Evaluates
until:

  * `steps` batches are processed, or
  * `input_fn` raises an end-of-input exception (`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` or `StopIteration`).

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  A function that constructs the input data for evaluation. See Premade Estimators for more information. The function should construct and return one of the following: 
  * A `tf.data.Dataset` object: Outputs of `Dataset` object must be a tuple `(features, labels)` with same constraints as below.
  * A tuple `(features, labels)`: Where `features` is a `tf.Tensor` or a dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor` and `labels` is a `Tensor` or a dictionary of string label name to `Tensor`. Both `features` and `labels` are consumed by `model_fn`. They should satisfy the expectation of `model_fn` from inputs. 

  
`steps` |  Number of steps for which to evaluate model. If `None`, evaluates until `input_fn` raises an end-of-input exception.   
`hooks` |  List of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` subclass instances. Used for callbacks inside the evaluation call.   
`checkpoint_path` |  Path of a specific checkpoint to evaluate. If `None`, the latest checkpoint in `model_dir` is used. If there are no checkpoints in `model_dir`, evaluation is run with newly initialized `Variables` instead of ones restored from checkpoint.   
`name` |  Name of the evaluation if user needs to run multiple evaluations on different data sets, such as on training data vs test data. Metrics for different evaluations are saved in separate folders, and appear separately in tensorboard.   
Returns  
---  
A dict containing the evaluation metrics specified in `model_fn` keyed by
name, as well as an entry `global_step` which contains the value of the global
step for which this evaluation was performed. For canned estimators, the dict
contains the `loss` (mean loss per mini-batch) and the `average_loss` (mean
loss per sample). Canned classifiers also return the `accuracy`. Canned
regressors also return the `label/mean` and the `prediction/mean`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `steps <= 0`.   
### `experimental_export_all_saved_models`

View source

    
    experimental_export_all_saved_models(
        export_dir_base, input_receiver_fn_map, assets_extra=None, as_text=False,
        checkpoint_path=None
    )
    
Exports a `SavedModel` with `tf.MetaGraphDefs` for each requested mode.

For each mode passed in via the `input_receiver_fn_map`, this method builds a
new graph by calling the `input_receiver_fn` to obtain feature and label
`Tensor`s. Next, this method calls the `Estimator`'s `model_fn` in the passed
mode to generate the model graph based on those features and labels, and
restores the given checkpoint (or, lacking that, the most recent checkpoint)
into the graph. Only one of the modes is used for saving variables to the
`SavedModel` (order of preference: `tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN`,
`tf.estimator.ModeKeys.EVAL`, then `tf.estimator.ModeKeys.PREDICT`), such that
up to three `tf.MetaGraphDefs` are saved with a single set of variables in a
single `SavedModel` directory.

For the variables and `tf.MetaGraphDefs`, a timestamped export directory below
`export_dir_base`, and writes a `SavedModel` into it containing the
`tf.MetaGraphDef` for the given mode and its associated signatures.

For prediction, the exported `MetaGraphDef` will provide one `SignatureDef`
for each element of the `export_outputs` dict returned from the `model_fn`,
named using the same keys. One of these keys is always
`tf.saved_model.signature_constants.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY`,
indicating which signature will be served when a serving request does not
specify one. For each signature, the outputs are provided by the corresponding
`tf.estimator.export.ExportOutput`s, and the inputs are always the input
receivers provided by the `serving_input_receiver_fn`.

For training and evaluation, the `train_op` is stored in an extra collection,
and loss, metrics, and predictions are included in a `SignatureDef` for the
mode in question.

Extra assets may be written into the `SavedModel` via the `assets_extra`
argument. This should be a dict, where each key gives a destination path
(including the filename) relative to the assets.extra directory. The
corresponding value gives the full path of the source file to be copied. For
example, the simple case of copying a single file without renaming it is
specified as `{'my_asset_file.txt': '/path/to/my_asset_file.txt'}`.

Args  
---  
`export_dir_base` |  A string containing a directory in which to create timestamped subdirectories containing exported `SavedModel`s.   
`input_receiver_fn_map` |  dict of `tf.estimator.ModeKeys` to `input_receiver_fn` mappings, where the `input_receiver_fn` is a function that takes no arguments and returns the appropriate subclass of `InputReceiver`.   
`assets_extra` |  A dict specifying how to populate the assets.extra directory within the exported `SavedModel`, or `None` if no extra assets are needed.   
`as_text` |  whether to write the `SavedModel` proto in text format.   
`checkpoint_path` |  The checkpoint path to export. If `None` (the default), the most recent checkpoint found within the model directory is chosen.   
Returns  
---  
The path to the exported directory as a bytes object.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if any `input_receiver_fn` is `None`, no `export_outputs` are provided, or no checkpoint can be found.   
### `export_saved_model`

View source

    
    export_saved_model(
        export_dir_base, serving_input_receiver_fn, assets_extra=None, as_text=False,
        checkpoint_path=None, experimental_mode=ModeKeys.PREDICT
    )
    
Exports inference graph as a `SavedModel` into the given dir.

For a detailed guide, see SavedModel from Estimators.

This method builds a new graph by first calling the
`serving_input_receiver_fn` to obtain feature `Tensor`s, and then calling this
`Estimator`'s `model_fn` to generate the model graph based on those features.
It restores the given checkpoint (or, lacking that, the most recent
checkpoint) into this graph in a fresh session. Finally it creates a
timestamped export directory below the given `export_dir_base`, and writes a
`SavedModel` into it containing a single `tf.MetaGraphDef` saved from this
session.

The exported `MetaGraphDef` will provide one `SignatureDef` for each element
of the `export_outputs` dict returned from the `model_fn`, named using the
same keys. One of these keys is always
`tf.saved_model.signature_constants.DEFAULT_SERVING_SIGNATURE_DEF_KEY`,
indicating which signature will be served when a serving request does not
specify one. For each signature, the outputs are provided by the corresponding
`tf.estimator.export.ExportOutput`s, and the inputs are always the input
receivers provided by the `serving_input_receiver_fn`.

Extra assets may be written into the `SavedModel` via the `assets_extra`
argument. This should be a dict, where each key gives a destination path
(including the filename) relative to the assets.extra directory. The
corresponding value gives the full path of the source file to be copied. For
example, the simple case of copying a single file without renaming it is
specified as `{'my_asset_file.txt': '/path/to/my_asset_file.txt'}`.

The experimental_mode parameter can be used to export a single
train/eval/predict graph as a `SavedModel`. See
`experimental_export_all_saved_models` for full docs.

Args  
---  
`export_dir_base` |  A string containing a directory in which to create timestamped subdirectories containing exported `SavedModel`s.   
`serving_input_receiver_fn` |  A function that takes no argument and returns a `tf.estimator.export.ServingInputReceiver` or `tf.estimator.export.TensorServingInputReceiver`.   
`assets_extra` |  A dict specifying how to populate the assets.extra directory within the exported `SavedModel`, or `None` if no extra assets are needed.   
`as_text` |  whether to write the `SavedModel` proto in text format.   
`checkpoint_path` |  The checkpoint path to export. If `None` (the default), the most recent checkpoint found within the model directory is chosen.   
`experimental_mode` |  `tf.estimator.ModeKeys` value indicating with mode will be exported. Note that this feature is experimental.   
Returns  
---  
The path to the exported directory as a bytes object.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if no `serving_input_receiver_fn` is provided, no `export_outputs` are provided, or no checkpoint can be found.

View source

    
    predict(
        input_fn, predict_keys=None, hooks=None, checkpoint_path=None,
        yield_single_examples=True
    )
    
Yields predictions for given features.

Please note that interleaving two predict outputs does not work. See:
issue/20506

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  A function that constructs the features. Prediction continues until `input_fn` raises an end-of-input exception (`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` or `StopIteration`). See Premade Estimators for more information. The function should construct and return one of the following: 
  * `tf.data.Dataset` object -- Outputs of `Dataset` object must have same constraints as below.

  * A tuple, in which case the first item is extracted as features. 

  
`predict_keys` |  list of `str`, name of the keys to predict. It is used if the `tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec.predictions` is a `dict`. If `predict_keys` is used then rest of the predictions will be filtered from the dictionary. If `None`, returns all.

`checkpoint_path` |  Path of a specific checkpoint to predict. If `None`, the latest checkpoint in `model_dir` is used. If there are no checkpoints in `model_dir`, prediction is run with newly initialized `Variables` instead of ones restored from checkpoint.   
`yield_single_examples` |  If `False`, yields the whole batch as returned by the `model_fn` instead of decomposing the batch into individual elements. This is useful if `model_fn` returns some tensors whose first dimension is not equal to the batch size.   
Yields  
---  
Evaluated values of `predictions` tensors.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If batch length of predictions is not the same and `yield_single_examples` is `True`.   
`ValueError` |  If there is a conflict between `predict_keys` and `predictions`. For example if `predict_keys` is not `None` but `tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec.predictions` is not a `dict`.   
### `predict_cluster_index`

View source

    
    predict_cluster_index(

    )
    
Finds the index of the closest cluster center to each input point.

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  Input points. See `tf.estimator.Estimator.predict`.   
Yields  
---  
The index of the closest cluster center for each input point.  
### `score`

View source

    
    score(
        input_fn
    )
    
Returns the sum of squared distances to nearest clusters.

Note that this function is different from the corresponding one in sklearn
which returns the negative sum.

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  Input points. See `tf.estimator.Estimator.evaluate`. Only one batch is retrieved.   
Returns  
---  
The sum of the squared distance from each point in the first batch of inputs
to its nearest cluster center.  
### `train`

View source

    
    train(
        input_fn, hooks=None, steps=None, max_steps=None, saving_listeners=None
    )
    
Trains a model given training data `input_fn`.

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  A function that provides input data for training as minibatches. See Premade Estimators for more information. The function should construct and return one of the following: 
  * A `tf.data.Dataset` object: Outputs of `Dataset` object must be a tuple `(features, labels)` with same constraints as below.
  * A tuple `(features, labels)`: Where `features` is a `tf.Tensor` or a dictionary of string feature name to `Tensor` and `labels` is a `Tensor` or a dictionary of string label name to `Tensor`. Both `features` and `labels` are consumed by `model_fn`. They should satisfy the expectation of `model_fn` from inputs. 

  
`hooks` |  List of `tf.train.SessionRunHook` subclass instances. Used for callbacks inside the training loop.   
`steps` |  Number of steps for which to train the model. If `None`, train forever or train until `input_fn` generates the `tf.errors.OutOfRange` error or `StopIteration` exception. `steps` works incrementally. If you call two times `train(steps=10)` then training occurs in total 20 steps. If `OutOfRange` or `StopIteration` occurs in the middle, training stops before 20 steps. If you don't want to have incremental behavior please set `max_steps` instead. If set, `max_steps` must be `None`.   
`max_steps` |  Number of total steps for which to train model. If `None`, train forever or train until `input_fn` generates the `tf.errors.OutOfRange` error or `StopIteration` exception. If set, `steps` must be `None`. If `OutOfRange` or `StopIteration` occurs in the middle, training stops before `max_steps` steps. Two calls to `train(steps=100)` means 200 training iterations. On the other hand, two calls to `train(max_steps=100)` means that the second call will not do any iteration since first call did all 100 steps.   
`saving_listeners` |  list of `CheckpointSaverListener` objects. Used for callbacks that run immediately before or after checkpoint savings.   
Returns  
---  
`self`, for chaining.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If both `steps` and `max_steps` are not `None`.   
`ValueError` |  If either `steps` or `max_steps <= 0`.   
### `transform`

View source

    
    transform(
        input_fn
    )
    
Transforms each input point to its distances to all cluster centers.

Note that if `distance_metric=KMeansClustering.SQUARED_EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE`,
this function returns the squared Euclidean distance while the corresponding
sklearn function returns the Euclidean distance.

Args  
---  
`input_fn` |  Input points. See `tf.estimator.Estimator.predict`.   
Yields  
---  
The distances from each input point to each cluster center.  
Class Variables
