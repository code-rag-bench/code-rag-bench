# tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs.numpy_input_fn

Returns input function that would feed dict of numpy arrays into the model.

    
    tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs.numpy_input_fn(
        x, y=None, batch_size=128, num_epochs=1, shuffle=None, queue_capacity=1000,
        num_threads=1
    )
    
This returns a function outputting `features` and `targets` based on the dict
of numpy arrays. The dict `features` has the same keys as the `x`. The dict
`targets` has the same keys as the `y` if `y` is a dict.

#### Example:

    
    age = np.arange(4) * 1.0
    height = np.arange(32, 36)
    x = {'age': age, 'height': height}
    y = np.arange(-32, -28)
    
    with tf.Session() as session:
      input_fn = numpy_io.numpy_input_fn(
          x, y, batch_size=2, shuffle=False, num_epochs=1)
    
Args  
---  
`x` |  numpy array object or dict of numpy array objects. If an array, the array will be treated as a single feature.   
`y` |  numpy array object or dict of numpy array object. `None` if absent.   
`batch_size` |  Integer, size of batches to return.   
`num_epochs` |  Integer, number of epochs to iterate over data. If `None` will run forever.   
`shuffle` |  Boolean, if True shuffles the queue. Avoid shuffle at prediction time.   
`queue_capacity` |  Integer, size of queue to accumulate.   
`num_threads` |  Integer, number of threads used for reading and enqueueing. In order to have predicted and repeatable order of reading and enqueueing, such as in prediction and evaluation mode, `num_threads` should be 1.   
Returns  
---  
Function, that has signature of ()->(dict of `features`, `targets`)  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if the shape of `y` mismatches the shape of values in `x` (i.e., values in `x` have same shape).   
`ValueError` |  if duplicate keys are in both `x` and `y` when `y` is a dict.   
`ValueError` |  if x or y is an empty dict.   
`TypeError` |  `x` is not a dict or array.   
`ValueError` |  if 'shuffle' is not provided or a bool.
