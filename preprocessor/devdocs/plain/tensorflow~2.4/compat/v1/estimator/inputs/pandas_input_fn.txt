# tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs.pandas_input_fn

Returns input function that would feed Pandas DataFrame into the model.

    
    tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs.pandas_input_fn(
        x, y=None, batch_size=128, num_epochs=1, shuffle=None, queue_capacity=1000,
        num_threads=1, target_column='target'
    )
    
> Note: `y`'s index must match `x`'s index.
Args  
---  
`x` |  pandas `DataFrame` object.   
`y` |  pandas `Series` object or `DataFrame`. `None` if absent.   
`batch_size` |  int, size of batches to return.   
`num_epochs` |  int, number of epochs to iterate over data. If not `None`, read attempts that would exceed this value will raise `OutOfRangeError`.   
`shuffle` |  bool, whether to read the records in random order.   
`queue_capacity` |  int, size of the read queue. If `None`, it will be set roughly to the size of `x`.   
`num_threads` |  Integer, number of threads used for reading and enqueueing. In order to have predicted and repeatable order of reading and enqueueing, such as in prediction and evaluation mode, `num_threads` should be 1.   
`target_column` |  str, name to give the target column `y`. This parameter is not used when `y` is a `DataFrame`.   
Returns  
---  
Function, that has signature of ()->(dict of `features`, `target`)  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if `x` already contains a column with the same name as `y`, or if the indexes of `x` and `y` don't match.   
`ValueError` |  if 'shuffle' is not provided or a bool.
