`tf.compat.v1.io.decode_csv`

    
    tf.compat.v1.decode_csv(
        records, record_defaults, field_delim=',', use_quote_delim=True,
        name=None, na_value='', select_cols=None
    )
    
RFC 4180 format is expected for the CSV records.
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) Note that we allow leading and trailing
spaces with int or float field.

Args  
---  
`records` |  A `Tensor` of type `string`. Each string is a record/row in the csv and all records should have the same format.   
`record_defaults` |  A list of `Tensor` objects with specific types. Acceptable types are `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `int64`, `string`. One tensor per column of the input record, with either a scalar default value for that column or an empty vector if the column is required.   
`field_delim` |  An optional `string`. Defaults to `","`. char delimiter to separate fields in a record.   
`use_quote_delim` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. If false, treats double quotation marks as regular characters inside of the string fields (ignoring RFC 4180, Section 2, Bullet 5).   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
`na_value` |  Additional string to recognize as NA/NaN.   
`select_cols` |  Optional sorted list of column indices to select. If specified, only this subset of columns will be parsed and returned.   
Returns  
---  
A list of `Tensor` objects. Has the same type as `record_defaults`. Each
tensor will have the same shape as records.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If any of the arguments is malformed.
