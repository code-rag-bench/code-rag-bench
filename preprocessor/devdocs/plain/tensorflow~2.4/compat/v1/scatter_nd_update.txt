# tf.compat.v1.scatter_nd_update

Applies sparse `updates` to individual values or slices in a Variable.

    
    tf.compat.v1.scatter_nd_update(
        ref, indices, updates, use_locking=True, name=None
    )
    
`ref` is a `Tensor` with rank `P` and `indices` is a `Tensor` of rank `Q`.

`indices` must be integer tensor, containing indices into `ref`. It must be
shape `[d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}, K]` where `0 < K <= P`.

The innermost dimension of `indices` (with length `K`) corresponds to indices
into elements (if `K = P`) or slices (if `K < P`) along the `K`th dimension of
`ref`.

`updates` is `Tensor` of rank `Q-1+P-K` with shape:

    
    [d_0, ..., d_{Q-2}, ref.shape[K], ..., ref.shape[P-1]].
    
For example, say we want to update 4 scattered elements to a rank-1 tensor to
8 elements. In Python, that update would look like this:

    
    ref = tf.Variable([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
    indices = tf.constant([[4], [3], [1] ,[7]])
    updates = tf.constant([9, 10, 11, 12])
    update = tf.compat.v1.scatter_nd_update(ref, indices, updates)
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
      print sess.run(update)
    
The resulting update to ref would look like this:

    
    [1, 11, 3, 10, 9, 6, 7, 12]
    
See `tf.scatter_nd` for more details about how to make updates to slices.

Args  
---  
`ref` |  A Variable.   
`indices` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `int32`, `int64`. A tensor of indices into ref.   
`updates` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `ref`. A Tensor. Must have the same type as ref. A tensor of updated values to add to ref.   
`use_locking` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `True`. An optional bool. Defaults to True. If True, the assignment will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The value of the variable after the update.
