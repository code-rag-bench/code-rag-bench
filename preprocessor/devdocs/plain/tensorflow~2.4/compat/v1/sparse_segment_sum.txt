`tf.compat.v1.sparse.segment_sum`

    
    tf.compat.v1.sparse_segment_sum(
        data, indices, segment_ids, name=None, num_segments=None
    )
    
Read the section on segmentation for an explanation of segments.

Like `tf.math.segment_sum`, but `segment_ids` can have rank less than `data`'s
first dimension, selecting a subset of dimension 0, specified by `indices`.
`segment_ids` is allowed to have missing ids, in which case the output will be
zeros at those indices. In those cases `num_segments` is used to determine the
size of the output.

#### For example:

    
    c = tf.constant([[1,2,3,4], [-1,-2,-3,-4], [5,6,7,8]])
    
    # Select two rows, one segment.
    tf.sparse.segment_sum(c, tf.constant([0, 1]), tf.constant([0, 0]))
    # => [[0 0 0 0]]
    
    # Select two rows, two segment.
    tf.sparse.segment_sum(c, tf.constant([0, 1]), tf.constant([0, 1]))
    # => [[ 1  2  3  4]
    #     [-1 -2 -3 -4]]
    
    # With missing segment ids.
    tf.sparse.segment_sum(c, tf.constant([0, 1]), tf.constant([0, 2]),
                          num_segments=4)
    # => [[ 1  2  3  4]
    #     [ 0  0  0  0]
    #     [-1 -2 -3 -4]
    #     [ 0  0  0  0]]
    
    # Select all rows, two segments.
    tf.sparse.segment_sum(c, tf.constant([0, 1, 2]), tf.constant([0, 0, 1]))
    # => [[0 0 0 0]
    #     [5 6 7 8]]
    
    # Which is equivalent to:
    tf.math.segment_sum(c, tf.constant([0, 0, 1]))
    
Args  
---  
`data` |  A `Tensor` with data that will be assembled in the output.   
`indices` |  A 1-D `Tensor` with indices into `data`. Has same rank as `segment_ids`.   
`segment_ids` |  A 1-D `Tensor` with indices into the output `Tensor`. Values should be sorted and can be repeated.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
`num_segments` |  An optional int32 scalar. Indicates the size of the output `Tensor`.   
Returns  
---  
A `tensor` of the shape as data, except for dimension 0 which has size `k`,
the number of segments specified via `num_segments` or inferred for the last
element in `segments_ids`.
