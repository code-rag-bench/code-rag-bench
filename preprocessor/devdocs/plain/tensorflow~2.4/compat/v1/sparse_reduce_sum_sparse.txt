`tf.compat.v1.sparse.reduce_sum_sparse`

    
    tf.compat.v1.sparse_reduce_sum_sparse(
        sp_input, axis=None, keepdims=None, reduction_axes=None, keep_dims=None
    )
    
Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(keep_dims)`. They will be removed in
a future version. Instructions for updating: keep_dims is deprecated, use
keepdims instead

This Op takes a SparseTensor and is the sparse counterpart to
`tf.reduce_sum()`. In contrast to SparseReduceSum, this Op returns a
SparseTensor.

> Note: A gradient is not defined for this function, so it can't be used in
> training models that need gradient descent.
Reduces `sp_input` along the dimensions given in `reduction_axes`. Unless
`keepdims` is true, the rank of the tensor is reduced by 1 for each entry in
`reduction_axes`. If `keepdims` is true, the reduced dimensions are retained
with length 1.

If `reduction_axes` has no entries, all dimensions are reduced, and a tensor
with a single element is returned. Additionally, the axes can be negative,
which are interpreted according to the indexing rules in Python.

Args  
---  
`sp_input` |  The SparseTensor to reduce. Should have numeric type.   
`axis` |  The dimensions to reduce; list or scalar. If `None` (the default), reduces all dimensions.   
`keepdims` |  If true, retain reduced dimensions with length 1.   
`reduction_axes` |  Deprecated name of axis.   
`keep_dims` |  Deprecated alias for `keepdims`.   
Returns  
---  
The reduced SparseTensor.
