# tf.compat.v1.saved_model.simple_save

Convenience function to build a SavedModel suitable for serving. (deprecated)

    
    tf.compat.v1.saved_model.simple_save(
        session, export_dir, inputs, outputs, legacy_init_op=None
    )
    
Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: This function will only be available through the v1
compatibility library as tf.compat.v1.saved_model.simple_save.

In many common cases, saving models for serving will be as simple as:

    
    simple_save(session,
                export_dir,
                inputs={"x": x, "y": y},
                outputs={"z": z})
    
Although in many cases it's not necessary to understand all of the many ways
to configure a SavedModel, this method has a few practical implications:

  * It will be treated as a graph for inference / serving (i.e. uses the tag `saved_model.SERVING`)
  * The SavedModel will load in TensorFlow Serving and supports the Predict API. To use the Classify, Regress, or MultiInference APIs, please use either tf.Estimator or the lower level SavedModel APIs.
  * Some TensorFlow ops depend on information on disk or other information called "assets". These are generally handled automatically by adding the assets to the `GraphKeys.ASSET_FILEPATHS` collection. Only assets in that collection are exported; if you need more custom behavior, you'll need to use the SavedModelBuilder.

Args  
---  
`session` |  The TensorFlow session from which to save the meta graph and variables.   
`export_dir` |  The path to which the SavedModel will be stored.   
`inputs` |  dict mapping string input names to tensors. These are added to the SignatureDef as the inputs.   
`outputs` |  dict mapping string output names to tensors. These are added to the SignatureDef as the outputs.   
`legacy_init_op` |  Legacy support for op or group of ops to execute after the restore op upon a load.
