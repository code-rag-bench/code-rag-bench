# tf.compat.v1.distributions.StudentT

Student's t-distribution.

Inherits From: `Distribution`

    
    tf.compat.v1.distributions.StudentT(
        df, loc, scale, validate_args=False, allow_nan_stats=True,
        name='StudentT'
    )
    
This distribution has parameters: degree of freedom `df`, location `loc`, and
`scale`.

#### Mathematical details

The probability density function (pdf) is,

    
    pdf(x; df, mu, sigma) = (1 + y**2 / df)**(-0.5 (df + 1)) / Z
    where,
    y = (x - mu) / sigma
    Z = abs(sigma) sqrt(df pi) Gamma(0.5 df) / Gamma(0.5 (df + 1))
    
where:

  * `loc = mu`,
  * `scale = sigma`, and,
  * `Z` is the normalization constant, and,
  * `Gamma` is the gamma function.

The StudentT distribution is a member of the location-scale family, i.e., it
can be constructed as,

    
    X ~ StudentT(df, loc=0, scale=1)
    Y = loc + scale * X
    
Notice that `scale` has semantics more similar to standard deviation than
variance. However it is not actually the std. deviation; the Student's
t-distribution std. dev. is `scale sqrt(df / (df - 2))` when `df > 2`.

Samples of this distribution are reparameterized (pathwise differentiable).
The derivatives are computed using the approach described in (Figurnov et al.,
2018).

#### Examples

Examples of initialization of one or a batch of distributions.

    
    import tensorflow_probability as tfp
    tfd = tfp.distributions
    
    # Define a single scalar Student t distribution.
    single_dist = tfd.StudentT(df=3)
    
    # Evaluate the pdf at 1, returning a scalar Tensor.
    single_dist.prob(1.)
    
    # Define a batch of two scalar valued Student t's.
    # The first has degrees of freedom 2, mean 1, and scale 11.
    # The second 3, 2 and 22.
    multi_dist = tfd.StudentT(df=[2, 3], loc=[1, 2.], scale=[11, 22.])
    
    # Evaluate the pdf of the first distribution on 0, and the second on 1.5,
    # returning a length two tensor.
    multi_dist.prob([0, 1.5])
    
    # Get 3 samples, returning a 3 x 2 tensor.
    multi_dist.sample(3)
    
Arguments are broadcast when possible.

    
    # Define a batch of two Student's t distributions.
    # Both have df 2 and mean 1, but different scales.
    dist = tfd.StudentT(df=2, loc=1, scale=[11, 22.])
    
    # Evaluate the pdf of both distributions on the same point, 3.0,
    # returning a length 2 tensor.
    dist.prob(3.0)
    
Compute the gradients of samples w.r.t. the parameters:

    
    df = tf.constant(2.0)
    loc = tf.constant(2.0)
    scale = tf.constant(11.0)
    dist = tfd.StudentT(df=df, loc=loc, scale=scale)
    samples = dist.sample(5)  # Shape [5]
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(samples))  # Arbitrary loss function
    # Unbiased stochastic gradients of the loss function
    grads = tf.gradients(loss, [df, loc, scale])

Args  
---  
`df` |  Floating-point `Tensor`. The degrees of freedom of the distribution(s). `df` must contain only positive values.   
`loc` |  Floating-point `Tensor`. The mean(s) of the distribution(s).   
`scale` |  Floating-point `Tensor`. The scaling factor(s) for the distribution(s). Note that `scale` is not technically the standard deviation of this distribution but has semantics more similar to standard deviation than variance.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect outputs.   
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.   
`name` |  Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.   
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  if loc and scale are different dtypes.   
Attributes  
---  
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool` describing behavior when a stat is undefined. Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a Cauchy distribution is infinity. However, sometimes the statistic is undefined, e.g., if a distribution's pdf does not achieve a maximum within the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or - infinity), so the variance = E[(X - mean)**2] is also undefined.   
`batch_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single event index as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown. The batch dimensions are indexes into independent, non-identical parameterizations of this distribution.   
`df` |  Degrees of freedom in these Student's t distribution(s).   
`dtype` |  The `DType` of `Tensor`s handled by this `Distribution`.   
`event_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single batch as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown.   
`loc` |  Locations of these Student's t distribution(s).   
`name` |  Name prepended to all ops created by this `Distribution`.   
`parameters` |  Dictionary of parameters used to instantiate this `Distribution`.   
`reparameterization_type` |  Describes how samples from the distribution are reparameterized. Currently this is one of the static instances `distributions.FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED` or `distributions.NOT_REPARAMETERIZED`.   
`scale` |  Scaling factors of these Student's t distribution(s).   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool` indicating possibly expensive checks are enabled.

### `copy`

View source

    
    copy(
        **override_parameters_kwargs
    )

> Note: the copy distribution may continue to depend on the original
> initialization arguments.

Returns  
---  
`distribution` |  A new instance of `type(self)` initialized from the union of self.parameters and override_parameters_kwargs, i.e., `dict(self.parameters, **override_parameters_kwargs)`.   
### `covariance`

View source

    
    covariance(
        name='covariance'
    )
    
Covariance.

Covariance is (possibly) defined only for non-scalar-event distributions.

For example, for a length-`k`, vector-valued distribution, it is calculated
as,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - E[X_i]) (X_j - E[X_j])]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k x k` matrix, `0 <= (i, j) < k`, and `E` denotes
expectation.

Alternatively, for non-vector, multivariate distributions (e.g., matrix-
valued, Wishart), `Covariance` shall return a (batch of) matrices under some
vectorization of the events, i.e.,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(Vec(X)_i, Vec(X)_j) = [as above]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k' x k'` matrices, `0 <= (i, j) < k' =
reduce_prod(event_shape)`, and `Vec` is some function mapping indices of this
distribution's event dimensions to indices of a length-`k'` vector.

Args  
---  
`name` |  Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.   
Returns  
---  
`covariance` |  Floating-point `Tensor` with shape `[B1, ..., Bn, k', k']` where the first `n` dimensions are batch coordinates and `k' = reduce_prod(self.event_shape)`.

Denote this distribution (`self`) by `p` and the `other` distribution by `q`.
Assuming `p, q` are absolutely continuous with respect to reference measure
`r`, the KL divergence is defined as:

             = -int_F p(x) log q(x) dr(x) + int_F p(x) log p(x) dr(x)
             = H[p, q] - H[p]
    
where `F` denotes the support of the random variable `X ~ p`, `H[., .]`
denotes (Shanon) cross entropy, and `H[.]` denotes (Shanon) entropy.

Args  
---  
`other` |  `tfp.distributions.Distribution` instance.

Given random variable `X`, the cumulative distribution function `cdf` is:

    
    log_cdf(x) := Log[ P[X <= x] ]

                             = Log[ 1 - cdf(x) ]
    
Typically, different numerical approximations can be used for the log survival
function, which are more accurate than `1 - cdf(x)` when `x >> 1`.
