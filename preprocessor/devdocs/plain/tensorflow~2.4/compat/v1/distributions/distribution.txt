# tf.compat.v1.distributions.Distribution

A generic probability distribution base class.

    
    tf.compat.v1.distributions.Distribution(
        dtype, reparameterization_type, validate_args, allow_nan_stats, parameters=None,
        graph_parents=None, name=None
    )
    
`Distribution` is a base class for constructing and organizing properties
(e.g., mean, variance) of random variables (e.g, Bernoulli, Gaussian).

#### Subclassing

Subclasses are expected to implement a leading-underscore version of the same-
named function. The argument signature should be identical except for the
omission of `name="..."`. For example, to enable `log_prob(value,
name="log_prob")` a subclass should implement `_log_prob(value)`.

Subclasses can append to public-level docstrings by providing docstrings for
their method specializations. For example:

    
    @util.AppendDocstring("Some other details.")
    def _log_prob(self, value):
      ...
    
would add the string "Some other details." to the `log_prob` function
docstring. This is implemented as a simple decorator to avoid python linter
complaining about missing Args/Returns/Raises sections in the partial
docstrings.

#### Broadcasting, batching, and shapes

All distributions support batches of independent distributions of that type.
The batch shape is determined by broadcasting together the parameters.

The shape of arguments to `__init__`, `cdf`, `log_cdf`, `prob`, and `log_prob`
reflect this broadcasting, as does the return value of `sample` and
`sample_n`.

`sample_n_shape = [n] + batch_shape + event_shape`, where `sample_n_shape` is
the shape of the `Tensor` returned from `sample_n`, `n` is the number of
samples, `batch_shape` defines how many independent distributions there are,
and `event_shape` defines the shape of samples from each of those independent
distributions. Samples are independent along the `batch_shape` dimensions, but
not necessarily so along the `event_shape` dimensions (depending on the
particulars of the underlying distribution).

Using the `Uniform` distribution as an example:

    
    minval = 3.0
    maxval = [[4.0, 6.0],
              [10.0, 12.0]]
    
    # Broadcasting:
    # This instance represents 4 Uniform distributions. Each has a lower bound at
    # 3.0 as the `minval` parameter was broadcasted to match `maxval`'s shape.
    u = Uniform(minval, maxval)
    
    # `event_shape` is `TensorShape([])`.
    event_shape = u.event_shape
    # `event_shape_t` is a `Tensor` which will evaluate to [].
    event_shape_t = u.event_shape_tensor()
    
    # Sampling returns a sample per distribution. `samples` has shape
    # [5, 2, 2], which is [n] + batch_shape + event_shape, where n=5,
    # batch_shape=[2, 2], and event_shape=[].
    samples = u.sample_n(5)
    
    # The broadcasting holds across methods. Here we use `cdf` as an example. The
    # same holds for `log_cdf` and the likelihood functions.
    
    # `cum_prob` has shape [2, 2] as the `value` argument was broadcasted to the
    # shape of the `Uniform` instance.
    cum_prob_broadcast = u.cdf(4.0)
    
    # `cum_prob`'s shape is [2, 2], one per distribution. No broadcasting
    # occurred.
    cum_prob_per_dist = u.cdf([[4.0, 5.0],
                               [6.0, 7.0]])
    
    # INVALID as the `value` argument is not broadcastable to the distribution's
    # shape.
    cum_prob_invalid = u.cdf([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
    
#### Shapes

There are three important concepts associated with TensorFlow Distributions
shapes:

  * Event shape describes the shape of a single draw from the distribution; it may be dependent across dimensions. For scalar distributions, the event shape is `[]`. For a 5-dimensional MultivariateNormal, the event shape is `[5]`.
  * Batch shape describes independent, not identically distributed draws, aka a "collection" or "bunch" of distributions.
  * Sample shape describes independent, identically distributed draws of batches from the distribution family.

The event shape and the batch shape are properties of a Distribution object,
whereas the sample shape is associated with a specific call to `sample` or
`log_prob`.

For detailed usage examples of TensorFlow Distributions shapes, see this
tutorial

#### Parameter values leading to undefined statistics or distributions.

Some distributions do not have well-defined statistics for all initialization
parameter values. For example, the beta distribution is parameterized by
positive real numbers `concentration1` and `concentration0`, and does not have
well-defined mode if `concentration1 < 1` or `concentration0 < 1`.

The user is given the option of raising an exception or returning `NaN`.

    
    a = tf.exp(tf.matmul(logits, weights_a))
    b = tf.exp(tf.matmul(logits, weights_b))
    
    # Will raise exception if ANY batch member has a < 1 or b < 1.
    dist = distributions.beta(a, b, allow_nan_stats=False)
    mode = dist.mode().eval()
    
    # Will return NaN for batch members with either a < 1 or b < 1.
    dist = distributions.beta(a, b, allow_nan_stats=True)  # Default behavior
    mode = dist.mode().eval()
    
In all cases, an exception is raised if invalid parameters are passed, e.g.

    
    # Will raise an exception if any Op is run.
    negative_a = -1.0 * a  # beta distribution by definition has a > 0.
    dist = distributions.beta(negative_a, b, allow_nan_stats=True)
    dist.mean().eval()
    
Args  
---  
`dtype` |  The type of the event samples. `None` implies no type-enforcement.   
`reparameterization_type` |  Instance of `ReparameterizationType`. If `distributions.FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED`, this `Distribution` can be reparameterized in terms of some standard distribution with a function whose Jacobian is constant for the support of the standard distribution. If `distributions.NOT_REPARAMETERIZED`, then no such reparameterization is available.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect outputs.   
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.   
`parameters` |  Python `dict` of parameters used to instantiate this `Distribution`.   
`graph_parents` |  Python `list` of graph prerequisites of this `Distribution`.   
`name` |  Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class. Default: subclass name.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if any member of graph_parents is `None` or not a `Tensor`.   
Attributes  
---  
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool` describing behavior when a stat is undefined. Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a Cauchy distribution is infinity. However, sometimes the statistic is undefined, e.g., if a distribution's pdf does not achieve a maximum within the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or - infinity), so the variance = E[(X - mean)**2] is also undefined.   
`batch_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single event index as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown. The batch dimensions are indexes into independent, non-identical parameterizations of this distribution.   
`dtype` |  The `DType` of `Tensor`s handled by this `Distribution`.   
`event_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single batch as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown.   
`name` |  Name prepended to all ops created by this `Distribution`.   
`parameters` |  Dictionary of parameters used to instantiate this `Distribution`.   
`reparameterization_type` |  Describes how samples from the distribution are reparameterized. Currently this is one of the static instances `distributions.FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED` or `distributions.NOT_REPARAMETERIZED`.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool` indicating possibly expensive checks are enabled.

Covariance is (possibly) defined only for non-scalar-event distributions.

For example, for a length-`k`, vector-valued distribution, it is calculated
as,

where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k x k` matrix, `0 <= (i, j) < k`, and `E` denotes
expectation.

Alternatively, for non-vector, multivariate distributions (e.g., matrix-
valued, Wishart), `Covariance` shall return a (batch of) matrices under some
vectorization of the events, i.e.,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(Vec(X)_i, Vec(X)_j) = [as above]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k' x k'` matrices, `0 <= (i, j) < k' =
reduce_prod(event_shape)`, and `Vec` is some function mapping indices of this
distribution's event dimensions to indices of a length-`k'` vector.

Args

denotes (Shanon) cross entropy, and `H[.]` denotes (Shanon) entropy.

Args  
---

                             = Log[ 1 - cdf(x) ]
    
Typically, different numerical approximations can be used for the log survival
function, which are more accurate than `1 - cdf(x)` when `x >> 1`.
