# tf.compat.v1.distributions.Bernoulli

Bernoulli distribution.

Inherits From: `Distribution`

    
    tf.compat.v1.distributions.Bernoulli(
        logits=None, probs=None, dtype=tf.dtypes.int32, validate_args=False,
        allow_nan_stats=True, name='Bernoulli'
    )
    
The Bernoulli distribution with `probs` parameter, i.e., the probability of a
`1` outcome (vs a `0` outcome).

Args  
---  
`logits` |  An N-D `Tensor` representing the log-odds of a `1` event. Each entry in the `Tensor` parametrizes an independent Bernoulli distribution where the probability of an event is sigmoid(logits). Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be passed in.   
`probs` |  An N-D `Tensor` representing the probability of a `1` event. Each entry in the `Tensor` parameterizes an independent Bernoulli distribution. Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be passed in.   
`dtype` |  The type of the event samples. Default: `int32`.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect outputs.   
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.   
`name` |  Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If p and logits are passed, or if neither are passed.   
Attributes  
---  
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool` describing behavior when a stat is undefined. Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a Cauchy distribution is infinity. However, sometimes the statistic is undefined, e.g., if a distribution's pdf does not achieve a maximum within the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or - infinity), so the variance = E[(X - mean)**2] is also undefined.   
`batch_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single event index as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown. The batch dimensions are indexes into independent, non-identical parameterizations of this distribution.   
`dtype` |  The `DType` of `Tensor`s handled by this `Distribution`.   
`event_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single batch as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown.   
`logits` |  Log-odds of a `1` outcome (vs `0`).   
`name` |  Name prepended to all ops created by this `Distribution`.   
`parameters` |  Dictionary of parameters used to instantiate this `Distribution`.   
`probs` |  Probability of a `1` outcome (vs `0`).   
`reparameterization_type` |  Describes how samples from the distribution are reparameterized. Currently this is one of the static instances `distributions.FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED` or `distributions.NOT_REPARAMETERIZED`.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool` indicating possibly expensive checks are enabled.

        name='batch_shape_tensor'
    )

The batch dimensions are indexes into independent, non-identical
parameterizations of this distribution.

Args  
---  
`name` |  name to give to the op   
Returns  
---  
`batch_shape` |  `Tensor`.   
### `cdf`

        value, name='cdf'
    )
    
Cumulative distribution function.

Given random variable `X`, the cumulative distribution function `cdf` is:

    
    cdf(x) := P[X <= x]
    
Args  
---

`name` |  Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.   
Returns  
---  
`cdf` |  a `Tensor` of shape `sample_shape(x) + self.batch_shape` with values of type `self.dtype`.   
### `copy`

View source

    
    copy(
        **override_parameters_kwargs
    )
    
Creates a deep copy of the distribution.

> Note: the copy distribution may continue to depend on the original
> initialization arguments.
Args  
---  
`**override_parameters_kwargs` |  String/value dictionary of initialization arguments to override with new values.   
Returns  
---  
`distribution` |  A new instance of `type(self)` initialized from the union of self.parameters and override_parameters_kwargs, i.e., `dict(self.parameters, **override_parameters_kwargs)`.   
### `covariance`

View source

    
    covariance(
        name='covariance'
    )
    
Covariance.

Covariance is (possibly) defined only for non-scalar-event distributions.

For example, for a length-`k`, vector-valued distribution, it is calculated
as,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - E[X_i]) (X_j - E[X_j])]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k x k` matrix, `0 <= (i, j) < k`, and `E` denotes
expectation.

Alternatively, for non-vector, multivariate distributions (e.g., matrix-
valued, Wishart), `Covariance` shall return a (batch of) matrices under some
vectorization of the events, i.e.,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(Vec(X)_i, Vec(X)_j) = [as above]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k' x k'` matrices, `0 <= (i, j) < k' =
reduce_prod(event_shape)`, and `Vec` is some function mapping indices of this
distribution's event dimensions to indices of a length-`k'` vector.

Args  
---  
`name` |  Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.   
Returns  
---  
`covariance` |  Floating-point `Tensor` with shape `[B1, ..., Bn, k', k']` where the first `n` dimensions are batch coordinates and `k' = reduce_prod(self.event_shape)`.

Assuming `P, Q` are absolutely continuous with respect to one another and
permit densities `p(x) dr(x)` and `q(x) dr(x)`, (Shanon) cross entropy is
defined as:

        other, name='kl_divergence'

Denote this distribution (`self`) by `p` and the `other` distribution by `q`.
Assuming `p, q` are absolutely continuous with respect to reference measure
`r`, the KL divergence is defined as:

    
    KL[p, q] = E_p[log(p(X)/q(X))]
             = -int_F p(x) log q(x) dr(x) + int_F p(x) log p(x) dr(x)
             = H[p, q] - H[p]
    
where `F` denotes the support of the random variable `X ~ p`, `H[., .]`
denotes (Shanon) cross entropy, and `H[.]` denotes (Shanon) entropy.

Args  
---  
`other` |  `tfp.distributions.Distribution` instance.   
`name` |  Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.   
Returns

                             = Log[ 1 - cdf(x) ]
    
Typically, different numerical approximations can be used for the log survival
function, which are more accurate than `1 - cdf(x)` when `x >> 1`.
