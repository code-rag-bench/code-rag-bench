# tf.compat.v1.distributions.DirichletMultinomial

Dirichlet-Multinomial compound distribution.

Inherits From: `Distribution`

    
    tf.compat.v1.distributions.DirichletMultinomial(
        total_count, concentration, validate_args=False, allow_nan_stats=True,
        name='DirichletMultinomial'
    )
    
The Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution is parameterized by a (batch of)
length-`K` `concentration` vectors (`K > 1`) and a `total_count` number of
trials, i.e., the number of trials per draw from the DirichletMultinomial. It
is defined over a (batch of) length-`K` vector `counts` such that
`tf.reduce_sum(counts, -1) = total_count`. The Dirichlet-Multinomial is
identically the Beta-Binomial distribution when `K = 2`.

#### Mathematical Details

The Dirichlet-Multinomial is a distribution over `K`-class counts, i.e., a
length-`K` vector of non-negative integer `counts = n = [n_0, ..., n_{K-1}]`.

The probability mass function (pmf) is,

    
    pmf(n; alpha, N) = Beta(alpha + n) / (prod_j n_j!) / Z
    Z = Beta(alpha) / N!
    
where:

  * `concentration = alpha = [alpha_0, ..., alpha_{K-1}]`, `alpha_j > 0`,
  * `total_count = N`, `N` a positive integer,
  * `N!` is `N` factorial, and,
  * `Beta(x) = prod_j Gamma(x_j) / Gamma(sum_j x_j)` is the multivariate beta function, and,
  * `Gamma` is the gamma function.

Dirichlet-Multinomial is a compound distribution, i.e., its samples are
generated as follows.

  1. Choose class probabilities: `probs = [p_0,...,p_{K-1}] ~ Dir(concentration)`
  2. Draw integers: `counts = [n_0,...,n_{K-1}] ~ Multinomial(total_count, probs)`

The last `concentration` dimension parametrizes a single Dirichlet-Multinomial
distribution. When calling distribution functions (e.g., `dist.prob(counts)`),
`concentration`, `total_count` and `counts` are broadcast to the same shape.
The last dimension of `counts` corresponds single Dirichlet-Multinomial
distributions.

Distribution parameters are automatically broadcast in all functions; see
examples for details.

#### Pitfalls

The number of classes, `K`, must not exceed:

  * the largest integer representable by `self.dtype`, i.e., `2**(mantissa_bits+1)` (IEE754),
  * the maximum `Tensor` index, i.e., `2**31-1`.

In other words,

    
    K <= min(2**31-1, {
      tf.float16: 2**11,
      tf.float32: 2**24,
      tf.float64: 2**53 }[param.dtype])
    
> Note: This condition is validated only when `self.validate_args = True`.
#### Examples

    
    alpha = [1., 2., 3.]
    n = 2.
    dist = DirichletMultinomial(n, alpha)
    
Creates a 3-class distribution, with the 3rd class is most likely to be drawn.
The distribution functions can be evaluated on counts.

    
    # counts same shape as alpha.
    counts = [0., 0., 2.]
    dist.prob(counts)  # Shape []
    
    # alpha will be broadcast to [[1., 2., 3.], [1., 2., 3.]] to match counts.
    counts = [[1., 1., 0.], [1., 0., 1.]]
    dist.prob(counts)  # Shape [2]
    
    # alpha will be broadcast to shape [5, 7, 3] to match counts.
    counts = [[...]]  # Shape [5, 7, 3]
    dist.prob(counts)  # Shape [5, 7]
    
Creates a 2-batch of 3-class distributions.

    
    alpha = [[1., 2., 3.], [4., 5., 6.]]  # Shape [2, 3]
    n = [3., 3.]
    dist = DirichletMultinomial(n, alpha)
    
    # counts will be broadcast to [[2., 1., 0.], [2., 1., 0.]] to match alpha.
    counts = [2., 1., 0.]
    dist.prob(counts)  # Shape [2]
    
Args  
---  
`total_count` |  Non-negative floating point tensor, whose dtype is the same as `concentration`. The shape is broadcastable to `[N1,..., Nm]` with `m >= 0`. Defines this as a batch of `N1 x ... x Nm` different Dirichlet multinomial distributions. Its components should be equal to integer values.   
`concentration` |  Positive floating point tensor, whose dtype is the same as `n` with shape broadcastable to `[N1,..., Nm, K]` `m >= 0`. Defines this as a batch of `N1 x ... x Nm` different `K` class Dirichlet multinomial distributions.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect outputs.   
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.   
`name` |  Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.   
Attributes  
---  
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool` describing behavior when a stat is undefined. Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a Cauchy distribution is infinity. However, sometimes the statistic is undefined, e.g., if a distribution's pdf does not achieve a maximum within the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or - infinity), so the variance = E[(X - mean)**2] is also undefined.   
`batch_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single event index as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown. The batch dimensions are indexes into independent, non-identical parameterizations of this distribution.   
`concentration` |  Concentration parameter; expected prior counts for that coordinate.   
`dtype` |  The `DType` of `Tensor`s handled by this `Distribution`.   
`event_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single batch as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown.   
`name` |  Name prepended to all ops created by this `Distribution`.   
`parameters` |  Dictionary of parameters used to instantiate this `Distribution`.   
`reparameterization_type` |  Describes how samples from the distribution are reparameterized. Currently this is one of the static instances `distributions.FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED` or `distributions.NOT_REPARAMETERIZED`.   
`total_concentration` |  Sum of last dim of concentration parameter.   
`total_count` |  Number of trials used to construct a sample.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool` indicating possibly expensive checks are enabled.

### `copy`

View source

Returns  
---  
`distribution` |  A new instance of `type(self)` initialized from the union of self.parameters and override_parameters_kwargs, i.e., `dict(self.parameters, **override_parameters_kwargs)`.   
### `covariance`

View source

    
    covariance(
        name='covariance'
    )
    
Covariance.

Covariance is (possibly) defined only for non-scalar-event distributions.

For example, for a length-`k`, vector-valued distribution, it is calculated
as,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - E[X_i]) (X_j - E[X_j])]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k x k` matrix, `0 <= (i, j) < k`, and `E` denotes
expectation.

Alternatively, for non-vector, multivariate distributions (e.g., matrix-
valued, Wishart), `Covariance` shall return a (batch of) matrices under some
vectorization of the events, i.e.,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(Vec(X)_i, Vec(X)_j) = [as above]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k' x k'` matrices, `0 <= (i, j) < k' =
reduce_prod(event_shape)`, and `Vec` is some function mapping indices of this
distribution's event dimensions to indices of a length-`k'` vector.

Additional documentation from `DirichletMultinomial`:

The covariance for each batch member is defined as the following:

    
    Var(X_j) = n * alpha_j / alpha_0 * (1 - alpha_j / alpha_0) *
    (n + alpha_0) / (1 + alpha_0)
    
where `concentration = alpha` and `total_concentration = alpha_0 = sum_j
alpha_j`.

The covariance between elements in a batch is defined as:

    
    Cov(X_i, X_j) = -n * alpha_i * alpha_j / alpha_0 ** 2 *
    (n + alpha_0) / (1 + alpha_0)

Additional documentation from `DirichletMultinomial`:

probability that after sampling `self.total_count` draws from this Dirichlet-
Multinomial distribution, the number of draws falling in class `j` is `n_j`.
Since this definition is exchangeable; different sequences have the same
counts so the probability includes a combinatorial coefficient.

                             = Log[ 1 - cdf(x) ]
    
Typically, different numerical approximations can be used for the log survival
function, which are more accurate than `1 - cdf(x)` when `x >> 1`.
