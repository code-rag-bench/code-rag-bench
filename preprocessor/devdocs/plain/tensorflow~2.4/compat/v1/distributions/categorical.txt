# tf.compat.v1.distributions.Categorical

Categorical distribution.

Inherits From: `Distribution`

    
    tf.compat.v1.distributions.Categorical(
        logits=None, probs=None, dtype=tf.dtypes.int32, validate_args=False,
        allow_nan_stats=True, name='Categorical'
    )
    
The Categorical distribution is parameterized by either probabilities or log-
probabilities of a set of `K` classes. It is defined over the integers `{0, 1,
..., K}`.

The Categorical distribution is closely related to the `OneHotCategorical` and
`Multinomial` distributions. The Categorical distribution can be intuited as
generating samples according to `argmax{ OneHotCategorical(probs) }` itself
being identical to `argmax{ Multinomial(probs, total_count=1) }`.

#### Mathematical Details

The probability mass function (pmf) is,

    
    pmf(k; pi) = prod_j pi_j**[k == j]
    
#### Pitfalls

The number of classes, `K`, must not exceed:

  * the largest integer representable by `self.dtype`, i.e., `2**(mantissa_bits+1)` (IEEE 754),
  * the maximum `Tensor` index, i.e., `2**31-1`.

In other words,

    
    K <= min(2**31-1, {
      tf.float16: 2**11,
      tf.float32: 2**24,
      tf.float64: 2**53 }[param.dtype])
    
> Note: This condition is validated only when `self.validate_args = True`.
#### Examples

Creates a 3-class distribution with the 2nd class being most likely.

    
    dist = Categorical(probs=[0.1, 0.5, 0.4])
    n = 1e4
    empirical_prob = tf.cast(
        tf.histogram_fixed_width(
          dist.sample(int(n)),
          [0., 2],
          nbins=3),
        dtype=tf.float32) / n
    # ==> array([ 0.1005,  0.5037,  0.3958], dtype=float32)
    
Creates a 3-class distribution with the 2nd class being most likely.
Parameterized by logits rather than probabilities.

    
    dist = Categorical(logits=np.log([0.1, 0.5, 0.4])
    n = 1e4
    empirical_prob = tf.cast(
        tf.histogram_fixed_width(
          dist.sample(int(n)),
          [0., 2],
          nbins=3),
        dtype=tf.float32) / n
    # ==> array([0.1045,  0.5047, 0.3908], dtype=float32)
    
Creates a 3-class distribution with the 3rd class being most likely. The
distribution functions can be evaluated on counts.

    
    # counts is a scalar.
    p = [0.1, 0.4, 0.5]
    dist = Categorical(probs=p)
    dist.prob(0)  # Shape []
    
    # p will be broadcast to [[0.1, 0.4, 0.5], [0.1, 0.4, 0.5]] to match counts.
    counts = [1, 0]
    dist.prob(counts)  # Shape [2]
    
    # p will be broadcast to shape [3, 5, 7, 3] to match counts.
    counts = [[...]] # Shape [5, 7, 3]
    dist.prob(counts)  # Shape [5, 7, 3]
    
Args  
---  
`logits` |  An N-D `Tensor`, `N >= 1`, representing the log probabilities of a set of Categorical distributions. The first `N - 1` dimensions index into a batch of independent distributions and the last dimension represents a vector of logits for each class. Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be passed in.   
`probs` |  An N-D `Tensor`, `N >= 1`, representing the probabilities of a set of Categorical distributions. The first `N - 1` dimensions index into a batch of independent distributions and the last dimension represents a vector of probabilities for each class. Only one of `logits` or `probs` should be passed in.   
`dtype` |  The type of the event samples (default: int32).   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect outputs.   
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.   
`name` |  Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.   
Attributes  
---  
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool` describing behavior when a stat is undefined. Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a Cauchy distribution is infinity. However, sometimes the statistic is undefined, e.g., if a distribution's pdf does not achieve a maximum within the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or - infinity), so the variance = E[(X - mean)**2] is also undefined.   
`batch_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single event index as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown. The batch dimensions are indexes into independent, non-identical parameterizations of this distribution.   
`dtype` |  The `DType` of `Tensor`s handled by this `Distribution`.   
`event_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single batch as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown.   
`event_size` |  Scalar `int32` tensor: the number of classes.   
`logits` |  Vector of coordinatewise logits.   
`name` |  Name prepended to all ops created by this `Distribution`.   
`parameters` |  Dictionary of parameters used to instantiate this `Distribution`.   
`probs` |  Vector of coordinatewise probabilities.   
`reparameterization_type` |  Describes how samples from the distribution are reparameterized. Currently this is one of the static instances `distributions.FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED` or `distributions.NOT_REPARAMETERIZED`.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool` indicating possibly expensive checks are enabled.

### `copy`

View source

Returns  
---  
`distribution` |  A new instance of `type(self)` initialized from the union of self.parameters and override_parameters_kwargs, i.e., `dict(self.parameters, **override_parameters_kwargs)`.   
### `covariance`

View source

        name='covariance'
    )
    
Covariance.

Covariance is (possibly) defined only for non-scalar-event distributions.

For example, for a length-`k`, vector-valued distribution, it is calculated
as,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - E[X_i]) (X_j - E[X_j])]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k x k` matrix, `0 <= (i, j) < k`, and `E` denotes
expectation.

Alternatively, for non-vector, multivariate distributions (e.g., matrix-
valued, Wishart), `Covariance` shall return a (batch of) matrices under some
vectorization of the events, i.e.,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(Vec(X)_i, Vec(X)_j) = [as above]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k' x k'` matrices, `0 <= (i, j) < k' =
reduce_prod(event_shape)`, and `Vec` is some function mapping indices of this
distribution's event dimensions to indices of a length-`k'` vector.

Args  
---  
`name` |  Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.   
Returns

             = -int_F p(x) log q(x) dr(x) + int_F p(x) log p(x) dr(x)
             = H[p, q] - H[p]
    
where `F` denotes the support of the random variable `X ~ p`, `H[., .]`
denotes (Shanon) cross entropy, and `H[.]` denotes (Shanon) entropy.

                             = Log[ 1 - cdf(x) ]
    
Typically, different numerical approximations can be used for the log survival
function, which are more accurate than `1 - cdf(x)` when `x >> 1`.
