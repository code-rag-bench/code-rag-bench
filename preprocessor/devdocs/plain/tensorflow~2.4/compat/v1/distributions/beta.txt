# tf.compat.v1.distributions.Beta

Beta distribution.

Inherits From: `Distribution`

    
    tf.compat.v1.distributions.Beta(
        concentration1=None, concentration0=None, validate_args=False,
        allow_nan_stats=True, name='Beta'
    )
    
The Beta distribution is defined over the `(0, 1)` interval using parameters
`concentration1` (aka "alpha") and `concentration0` (aka "beta").

#### Mathematical Details

The probability density function (pdf) is,

    
    pdf(x; alpha, beta) = x**(alpha - 1) (1 - x)**(beta - 1) / Z
    Z = Gamma(alpha) Gamma(beta) / Gamma(alpha + beta)
    
where:

  * `concentration1 = alpha`,
  * `concentration0 = beta`,
  * `Z` is the normalization constant, and,
  * `Gamma` is the gamma function.

The concentration parameters represent mean total counts of a `1` or a `0`,
i.e.,

    
    concentration1 = alpha = mean * total_concentration
    concentration0 = beta  = (1. - mean) * total_concentration
    
where `mean` in `(0, 1)` and `total_concentration` is a positive real number
representing a mean `total_count = concentration1 + concentration0`.

Distribution parameters are automatically broadcast in all functions; see
examples for details.

Warning: The samples can be zero due to finite precision. This happens more
often when some of the concentrations are very small. Make sure to round the
samples to `np.finfo(dtype).tiny` before computing the density.

Samples of this distribution are reparameterized (pathwise differentiable).
The derivatives are computed using the approach described in (Figurnov et al.,
2018).

#### Examples

    
    import tensorflow_probability as tfp
    tfd = tfp.distributions
    
    # Create a batch of three Beta distributions.
    alpha = [1, 2, 3]
    beta = [1, 2, 3]
    dist = tfd.Beta(alpha, beta)
    
    dist.sample([4, 5])  # Shape [4, 5, 3]
    
    # `x` has three batch entries, each with two samples.
    x = [[.1, .4, .5],
         [.2, .3, .5]]
    # Calculate the probability of each pair of samples under the corresponding
    # distribution in `dist`.
    dist.prob(x)         # Shape [2, 3]
    
    
    # Create batch_shape=[2, 3] via parameter broadcast:
    alpha = [[1.], [2]]      # Shape [2, 1]
    beta = [3., 4, 5]        # Shape [3]
    dist = tfd.Beta(alpha, beta)
    
    # alpha broadcast as: [[1., 1, 1,],
    #                      [2, 2, 2]]
    # beta broadcast as:  [[3., 4, 5],
    #                      [3, 4, 5]]
    # batch_Shape [2, 3]
    dist.sample([4, 5])  # Shape [4, 5, 2, 3]
    
    x = [.2, .3, .5]
    # x will be broadcast as [[.2, .3, .5],
    #                         [.2, .3, .5]],
    # thus matching batch_shape [2, 3].
    dist.prob(x)         # Shape [2, 3]
    
Compute the gradients of samples w.r.t. the parameters:

    
    alpha = tf.constant(1.0)
    beta = tf.constant(2.0)
    dist = tfd.Beta(alpha, beta)
    samples = dist.sample(5)  # Shape [5]
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(samples))  # Arbitrary loss function
    # Unbiased stochastic gradients of the loss function
    grads = tf.gradients(loss, [alpha, beta])

Args  
---  
`concentration1` |  Positive floating-point `Tensor` indicating mean number of successes; aka "alpha". Implies `self.dtype` and `self.batch_shape`, i.e., `concentration1.shape = [N1, N2, ..., Nm] = self.batch_shape`.   
`concentration0` |  Positive floating-point `Tensor` indicating mean number of failures; aka "beta". Otherwise has same semantics as `concentration1`.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect outputs.   
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.   
`name` |  Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.   
Attributes  
---  
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool` describing behavior when a stat is undefined. Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a Cauchy distribution is infinity. However, sometimes the statistic is undefined, e.g., if a distribution's pdf does not achieve a maximum within the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or - infinity), so the variance = E[(X - mean)**2] is also undefined.   
`batch_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single event index as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown. The batch dimensions are indexes into independent, non-identical parameterizations of this distribution.   
`concentration0` |  Concentration parameter associated with a `0` outcome.   
`concentration1` |  Concentration parameter associated with a `1` outcome.   
`dtype` |  The `DType` of `Tensor`s handled by this `Distribution`.   
`event_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single batch as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown.   
`name` |  Name prepended to all ops created by this `Distribution`.   
`parameters` |  Dictionary of parameters used to instantiate this `Distribution`.   
`reparameterization_type` |  Describes how samples from the distribution are reparameterized. Currently this is one of the static instances `distributions.FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED` or `distributions.NOT_REPARAMETERIZED`.   
`total_concentration` |  Sum of concentration parameters.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool` indicating possibly expensive checks are enabled.

### `copy`

View source

        **override_parameters_kwargs
    )

Returns  
---  
`distribution` |  A new instance of `type(self)` initialized from the union of self.parameters and override_parameters_kwargs, i.e., `dict(self.parameters, **override_parameters_kwargs)`.   
### `covariance`

View source

    
    covariance(
        name='covariance'
    )
    
Covariance.

Covariance is (possibly) defined only for non-scalar-event distributions.

For example, for a length-`k`, vector-valued distribution, it is calculated
as,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - E[X_i]) (X_j - E[X_j])]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k x k` matrix, `0 <= (i, j) < k`, and `E` denotes
expectation.

Alternatively, for non-vector, multivariate distributions (e.g., matrix-
valued, Wishart), `Covariance` shall return a (batch of) matrices under some
vectorization of the events, i.e.,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(Vec(X)_i, Vec(X)_j) = [as above]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k' x k'` matrices, `0 <= (i, j) < k' =
reduce_prod(event_shape)`, and `Vec` is some function mapping indices of this
distribution's event dimensions to indices of a length-`k'` vector.

Args  
---  
`name` |  Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.   
Returns  
---  
`covariance` |  Floating-point `Tensor` with shape `[B1, ..., Bn, k', k']` where the first `n` dimensions are batch coordinates and `k' = reduce_prod(self.event_shape)`.

Denote this distribution (`self`) by `p` and the `other` distribution by `q`.
Assuming `p, q` are absolutely continuous with respect to reference measure
`r`, the KL divergence is defined as:

    
    KL[p, q] = E_p[log(p(X)/q(X))]
             = -int_F p(x) log q(x) dr(x) + int_F p(x) log p(x) dr(x)
             = H[p, q] - H[p]
    
where `F` denotes the support of the random variable `X ~ p`, `H[., .]`
denotes (Shanon) cross entropy, and `H[.]` denotes (Shanon) entropy.

Args  
---

Given random variable `X`, the cumulative distribution function `cdf` is:

    
    log_cdf(x) := Log[ P[X <= x] ]
    
Often, a numerical approximation can be used for `log_cdf(x)` that yields a
more accurate answer than simply taking the logarithm of the `cdf` when `x <<
-1`.

        value, name='log_survival_function'
    )

Given random variable `X`, the survival function is defined:

    
    log_survival_function(x) = Log[ P[X > x] ]
                             = Log[ 1 - P[X <= x] ]
                             = Log[ 1 - cdf(x) ]
    
Typically, different numerical approximations can be used for the log survival
function, which are more accurate than `1 - cdf(x)` when `x >> 1`.
