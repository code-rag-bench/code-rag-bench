# tf.compat.v1.distributions.Dirichlet

Dirichlet distribution.

Inherits From: `Distribution`

    
    tf.compat.v1.distributions.Dirichlet(
        concentration, validate_args=False, allow_nan_stats=True,
        name='Dirichlet'
    )
    
The Dirichlet distribution is defined over the `(k-1)`-simplex using a
positive, length-`k` vector `concentration` (`k > 1`). The Dirichlet is
identically the Beta distribution when `k = 2`.

#### Mathematical Details

The Dirichlet is a distribution over the open `(k-1)`-simplex, i.e.,

    
    S^{k-1} = { (x_0, ..., x_{k-1}) in R^k : sum_j x_j = 1 and all_j x_j > 0 }.
    
The probability density function (pdf) is,

    
    pdf(x; alpha) = prod_j x_j**(alpha_j - 1) / Z
    Z = prod_j Gamma(alpha_j) / Gamma(sum_j alpha_j)
    
where:

  * `x in S^{k-1}`, i.e., the `(k-1)`-simplex,
  * `concentration = alpha = [alpha_0, ..., alpha_{k-1}]`, `alpha_j > 0`,
  * `Z` is the normalization constant aka the multivariate beta function, and,
  * `Gamma` is the gamma function.

The `concentration` represents mean total counts of class occurrence, i.e.,

    
    concentration = alpha = mean * total_concentration
    
where `mean` in `S^{k-1}` and `total_concentration` is a positive real number
representing a mean total count.

Distribution parameters are automatically broadcast in all functions; see
examples for details.

Warning: Some components of the samples can be zero due to finite precision.
This happens more often when some of the concentrations are very small. Make
sure to round the samples to `np.finfo(dtype).tiny` before computing the
density.

Samples of this distribution are reparameterized (pathwise differentiable).
The derivatives are computed using the approach described in (Figurnov et al.,
2018).

#### Examples

    
    import tensorflow_probability as tfp
    tfd = tfp.distributions
    
    # Create a single trivariate Dirichlet, with the 3rd class being three times
    # more frequent than the first. I.e., batch_shape=[], event_shape=[3].
    alpha = [1., 2, 3]
    dist = tfd.Dirichlet(alpha)
    
    dist.sample([4, 5])  # shape: [4, 5, 3]
    
    # x has one sample, one batch, three classes:
    x = [.2, .3, .5]   # shape: [3]
    dist.prob(x)       # shape: []
    
    # x has two samples from one batch:
    x = [[.1, .4, .5],
         [.2, .3, .5]]
    dist.prob(x)         # shape: [2]
    
    # alpha will be broadcast to shape [5, 7, 3] to match x.
    x = [[...]]   # shape: [5, 7, 3]
    dist.prob(x)  # shape: [5, 7]
    
    
    # Create batch_shape=[2], event_shape=[3]:
    alpha = [[1., 2, 3],
             [4, 5, 6]]   # shape: [2, 3]
    dist = tfd.Dirichlet(alpha)
    
    dist.sample([4, 5])  # shape: [4, 5, 2, 3]
    
    x = [.2, .3, .5]
    # x will be broadcast as [[.2, .3, .5],
    #                         [.2, .3, .5]],
    # thus matching batch_shape [2, 3].
    dist.prob(x)         # shape: [2]
    
Compute the gradients of samples w.r.t. the parameters:

    
    alpha = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    dist = tfd.Dirichlet(alpha)
    samples = dist.sample(5)  # Shape [5, 3]
    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(samples))  # Arbitrary loss function
    # Unbiased stochastic gradients of the loss function
    grads = tf.gradients(loss, alpha)

Args  
---  
`concentration` |  Positive floating-point `Tensor` indicating mean number of class occurrences; aka "alpha". Implies `self.dtype`, and `self.batch_shape`, `self.event_shape`, i.e., if `concentration.shape = [N1, N2, ..., Nm, k]` then `batch_shape = [N1, N2, ..., Nm]` and `event_shape = [k]`.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool`, default `False`. When `True` distribution parameters are checked for validity despite possibly degrading runtime performance. When `False` invalid inputs may silently render incorrect outputs.   
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool`, default `True`. When `True`, statistics (e.g., mean, mode, variance) use the value "`NaN`" to indicate the result is undefined. When `False`, an exception is raised if one or more of the statistic's batch members are undefined.   
`name` |  Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this class.   
Attributes  
---  
`allow_nan_stats` |  Python `bool` describing behavior when a stat is undefined. Stats return +/- infinity when it makes sense. E.g., the variance of a Cauchy distribution is infinity. However, sometimes the statistic is undefined, e.g., if a distribution's pdf does not achieve a maximum within the support of the distribution, the mode is undefined. If the mean is undefined, then by definition the variance is undefined. E.g. the mean for Student's T for df = 1 is undefined (no clear way to say it is either + or - infinity), so the variance = E[(X - mean)**2] is also undefined.   
`batch_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single event index as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown. The batch dimensions are indexes into independent, non-identical parameterizations of this distribution.   
`concentration` |  Concentration parameter; expected counts for that coordinate.   
`dtype` |  The `DType` of `Tensor`s handled by this `Distribution`.   
`event_shape` |  Shape of a single sample from a single batch as a `TensorShape`. May be partially defined or unknown.   
`name` |  Name prepended to all ops created by this `Distribution`.   
`parameters` |  Dictionary of parameters used to instantiate this `Distribution`.   
`reparameterization_type` |  Describes how samples from the distribution are reparameterized. Currently this is one of the static instances `distributions.FULLY_REPARAMETERIZED` or `distributions.NOT_REPARAMETERIZED`.   
`total_concentration` |  Sum of last dim of concentration parameter.   
`validate_args` |  Python `bool` indicating possibly expensive checks are enabled.

### `copy`

View source

Returns

### `covariance`

View source

        name='covariance'
    )
    
Covariance.

Covariance is (possibly) defined only for non-scalar-event distributions.

For example, for a length-`k`, vector-valued distribution, it is calculated
as,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - E[X_i]) (X_j - E[X_j])]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k x k` matrix, `0 <= (i, j) < k`, and `E` denotes
expectation.

Alternatively, for non-vector, multivariate distributions (e.g., matrix-
valued, Wishart), `Covariance` shall return a (batch of) matrices under some
vectorization of the events, i.e.,

    
    Cov[i, j] = Covariance(Vec(X)_i, Vec(X)_j) = [as above]
    
where `Cov` is a (batch of) `k' x k'` matrices, `0 <= (i, j) < k' =
reduce_prod(event_shape)`, and `Vec` is some function mapping indices of this
distribution's event dimensions to indices of a length-`k'` vector.

Args  
---  
`name` |  Python `str` prepended to names of ops created by this function.   
Returns  
---  
`covariance` |  Floating-point `Tensor` with shape `[B1, ..., Bn, k', k']` where the first `n` dimensions are batch coordinates and `k' = reduce_prod(self.event_shape)`.

Denote this distribution (`self`) by `p` and the `other` distribution by `q`.
Assuming `p, q` are absolutely continuous with respect to reference measure
`r`, the KL divergence is defined as:

    
    KL[p, q] = E_p[log(p(X)/q(X))]
             = -int_F p(x) log q(x) dr(x) + int_F p(x) log p(x) dr(x)
             = H[p, q] - H[p]
    
where `F` denotes the support of the random variable `X ~ p`, `H[., .]`
denotes (Shanon) cross entropy, and `H[.]` denotes (Shanon) entropy.

Args  
---  
`other` |  `tfp.distributions.Distribution` instance.

Given random variable `X`, the cumulative distribution function `cdf` is:

    
    log_cdf(x) := Log[ P[X <= x] ]
    
Often, a numerical approximation can be used for `log_cdf(x)` that yields a
more accurate answer than simply taking the logarithm of the `cdf` when `x <<

        value, name='log_survival_function'
    )

Given random variable `X`, the survival function is defined:

    
    log_survival_function(x) = Log[ P[X > x] ]
                             = Log[ 1 - P[X <= x] ]
                             = Log[ 1 - cdf(x) ]
    
Typically, different numerical approximations can be used for the log survival
function, which are more accurate than `1 - cdf(x)` when `x >> 1`.

> modes are undefined.
