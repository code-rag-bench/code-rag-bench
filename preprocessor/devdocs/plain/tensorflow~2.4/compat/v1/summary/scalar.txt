# tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar

Outputs a `Summary` protocol buffer containing a single scalar value.

    
    tf.compat.v1.summary.scalar(
        name, tensor, collections=None, family=None
    )
    
The generated Summary has a Tensor.proto containing the input Tensor.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the generated node. Will also serve as the series name in TensorBoard.   
`tensor` |  A real numeric Tensor containing a single value.   
`collections` |  Optional list of graph collections keys. The new summary op is added to these collections. Defaults to `[GraphKeys.SUMMARIES]`.   
`family` |  Optional; if provided, used as the prefix of the summary tag name, which controls the tab name used for display on Tensorboard.   
Returns  
---  
A scalar `Tensor` of type `string`. Which contains a `Summary` protobuf.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If tensor has the wrong shape or type.
