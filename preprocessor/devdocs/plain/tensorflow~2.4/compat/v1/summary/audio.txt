# tf.compat.v1.summary.audio

Outputs a `Summary` protocol buffer with audio.

    
    tf.compat.v1.summary.audio(
        name, tensor, sample_rate, max_outputs=3, collections=None, family=None
    )
    
The summary has up to `max_outputs` summary values containing audio. The audio
is built from `tensor` which must be 3-D with shape `[batch_size, frames,
channels]` or 2-D with shape `[batch_size, frames]`. The values are assumed to
be in the range of `[-1.0, 1.0]` with a sample rate of `sample_rate`.

The `tag` in the outputted Summary.Value protobufs is generated based on the
name, with a suffix depending on the max_outputs setting:

  * If `max_outputs` is 1, the summary value tag is 'name/audio'.
  * If `max_outputs` is greater than 1, the summary value tags are generated sequentially as 'name/audio/0', 'name/audio/1', etc

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the generated node. Will also serve as a series name in TensorBoard.   
`tensor` |  A 3-D `float32` `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, frames, channels]` or a 2-D `float32` `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, frames]`.   
`sample_rate` |  A Scalar `float32` `Tensor` indicating the sample rate of the signal in hertz.   
`max_outputs` |  Max number of batch elements to generate audio for.   
`collections` |  Optional list of ops.GraphKeys. The collections to add the summary to. Defaults to [_ops.GraphKeys.SUMMARIES]   
`family` |  Optional; if provided, used as the prefix of the summary tag name, which controls the tab name used for display on Tensorboard.   
Returns  
---  
A scalar `Tensor` of type `string`. The serialized `Summary` protocol buffer.
