# tf.compat.v1.summary.tensor_summary

Outputs a `Summary` protocol buffer with a serialized tensor.proto.

    
    tf.compat.v1.summary.tensor_summary(
        name, tensor, summary_description=None, collections=None, summary_metadata=None,
        family=None, display_name=None
    )
    
Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the generated node. If display_name is not set, it will also serve as the tag name in TensorBoard. (In that case, the tag name will inherit tf name scopes.)   
`tensor` |  A tensor of any type and shape to serialize.   
`summary_description` |  A long description of the summary sequence. Markdown is supported.   
`collections` |  Optional list of graph collections keys. The new summary op is added to these collections. Defaults to `[GraphKeys.SUMMARIES]`.   
`summary_metadata` |  Optional SummaryMetadata proto (which describes which plugins may use the summary value).   
`family` |  Optional; if provided, used as the prefix of the summary tag, which controls the name used for display on TensorBoard when display_name is not set.   
`display_name` |  A string used to name this data in TensorBoard. If this is not set, then the node name will be used instead.   
Returns  
---  
A scalar `Tensor` of type `string`. The serialized `Summary` protocol buffer.
