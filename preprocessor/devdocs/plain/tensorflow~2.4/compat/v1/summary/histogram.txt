# tf.compat.v1.summary.histogram

Outputs a `Summary` protocol buffer with a histogram.

    
    tf.compat.v1.summary.histogram(
        name, values, collections=None, family=None
    )
    
Adding a histogram summary makes it possible to visualize your data's
distribution in TensorBoard. You can see a detailed explanation of the
TensorBoard histogram dashboard here.

The generated `Summary` has one summary value containing a histogram for
`values`.

This op reports an `InvalidArgument` error if any value is not finite.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the generated node. Will also serve as a series name in TensorBoard.   
`values` |  A real numeric `Tensor`. Any shape. Values to use to build the histogram.   
`collections` |  Optional list of graph collections keys. The new summary op is added to these collections. Defaults to `[GraphKeys.SUMMARIES]`.   
`family` |  Optional; if provided, used as the prefix of the summary tag name, which controls the tab name used for display on Tensorboard.   
Returns  
---  
A scalar `Tensor` of type `string`. The serialized `Summary` protocol buffer.
