# tf.compat.v1.summary.get_summary_description

Given a TensorSummary node_def, retrieve its SummaryDescription.

    
    tf.compat.v1.summary.get_summary_description(
        node_def
    )
    
When a Summary op is instantiated, a SummaryDescription of associated metadata
is stored in its NodeDef. This method retrieves the description.

Args  
---  
`node_def` |  the node_def_pb2.NodeDef of a TensorSummary op   
Returns  
---  
a summary_pb2.SummaryDescription  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if the node is not a summary op.   
#### Eager Compatibility

Not compatible with eager execution. To write TensorBoard summaries under
eager execution, use `tf.contrib.summary` instead.
