    tf.compat.v1.mixed_precision.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite(
        opt, loss_scale='dynamic'
    )
    
Mixed precision is the use of both float32 and float16 data types when
training a model to improve performance. This is achieved via a graph rewrite
operation and a loss-scale optimizer.

Performing arithmetic operations in float16 takes advantage of specialized
processing units, such as NVIDIA Tensor Cores, for much higher arithmetic
throughput. However, due to the smaller representable range, performing the
entire training with float16 can result in gradient underflow, that is, small
gradient values becoming zeroes. Instead, performing only select arithmetic
operations in float16 results in higher throughput and decreased training time
when using compatible hardware accelerators while also reducing memory usage,
typically without sacrificing model accuracy.

> Note: While the mixed precision rewrite changes the datatype of various
> layers throughout the model, the same accuracy reached in float32 is
> expected. If a `NaN` gradient occurs with dynamic loss scaling, the model
> update for that batch is skipped. In this case, the global step count is not
> incremented, and the `LossScaleOptimizer` attempts to decrease the loss
> scaling value to avoid `NaN` values in subsequent iterations. This approach
> has been shown to achieve the same accuracy as float32 and, in most cases,
> better training throughput.
#### Example:

    
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='softmax'),
    ])
    
    opt = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD()
    opt = tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite(opt)
    model.compile(loss="mse", optimizer=opt)
    
    x_train = np.random.random((1024, 64))
    y_train = np.random.random((1024, 64))
    model.fit(x_train, y_train)
    
Calling `enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite(opt)` enables the graph rewrite
operation before computing gradients. The function additionally returns an
`Optimizer` (`opt`) wrapped with a `LossScaleOptimizer`. This prevents
underflow in the float16 tensors during the backward pass. An optimizer of
type `tf.train.Optimizer` or `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` must be passed to
this function, which will then be wrapped to use loss scaling.

The graph rewrite operation changes the `dtype` of certain operations in the
graph from float32 to float16. There are several categories of operations that
are either included or excluded by this rewrite operation. The following
categories of Ops are defined inside corresponding functions under the class
`AutoMixedPrecisionLists` in  auto_mixed_precision_lists.h:

  * `ClearList`: Ops that do not have numerically significant adverse effects. E.g. `ArgMax` and `Floor`.
  * `AllowList`: Ops that are considered numerically safe for execution in float16, and thus are always converted. E.g. `Conv2D`.
  * `DenyList`: Ops that are numerically unsafe to execute in float16 and can negatively affect downstream nodes. E.g. `Softmax`.
  * `GrayList`: Ops that are considered numerically safe for execution in float16 unless downstream from a DenyList Op. E.g. `Add` and `AvgPool`.

When this function is used, gradients should only be computed and applied with
the returned optimizer, either by calling `opt.minimize()` or
`opt.compute_gradients()` followed by `opt.apply_gradients()`. Gradients
should not be computed with `tf.gradients` or `tf.GradientTape`. This is
because the returned optimizer will apply loss scaling, and `tf.gradients` or
`tf.GradientTape` will not. If you do directly use `tf.gradients` or
`tf.GradientTape`, your model may not converge due to float16 underflow
problems.

When eager execution is enabled, the mixed precision graph rewrite is only
enabled within `tf.function`s, as outside `tf.function`s, there is no graph.

For NVIDIA GPUs with Tensor cores, as a general performance guide, dimensions
(such as batch size, input size, output size, and channel counts) should be
powers of two if under 256, or otherwise divisible by 8 if above 256. For more
information, check out the NVIDIA Deep Learning Performance Guide.

Currently, mixed precision is only enabled on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs with
Compute Capability 7.0 and above (Volta, Turing, or newer architectures). The
parts of the graph on CPUs and TPUs are untouched by the graph rewrite.

Raises  
---  
`ValueError`, if the `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API is also used by calling
`tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy`. Only one mixed precision
API can be used.  
Args  
---  
`opt` |  An instance of a `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` or a `tf.train.Optimizer`.   
`loss_scale` |  Either an int/float, the string `"dynamic"`, or an instance of a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale`. The loss scale to use. It is recommended to keep this as its default value of `"dynamic"`, which will adjust the scaling automatically to prevent `Inf` or `NaN` values.   
Returns  
---  
A version of `opt` that will use loss scaling to prevent underflow.
