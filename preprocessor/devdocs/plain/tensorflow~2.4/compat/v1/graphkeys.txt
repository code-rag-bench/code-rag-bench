# tf.compat.v1.GraphKeys

Standard names to use for graph collections.

The standard library uses various well-known names to collect and retrieve
values associated with a graph. For example, the `tf.Optimizer` subclasses
default to optimizing the variables collected under
`tf.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` if none is specified, but it is also
possible to pass an explicit list of variables.

The following standard keys are defined:

  * `GLOBAL_VARIABLES`: the default collection of `Variable` objects, shared across distributed environment (model variables are subset of these). See `tf.compat.v1.global_variables` for more details. Commonly, all `TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` variables will be in `MODEL_VARIABLES`, and all `MODEL_VARIABLES` variables will be in `GLOBAL_VARIABLES`.
  * `LOCAL_VARIABLES`: the subset of `Variable` objects that are local to each machine. Usually used for temporarily variables, like counters. Note: use `tf.contrib.framework.local_variable` to add to this collection.
  * `MODEL_VARIABLES`: the subset of `Variable` objects that are used in the model for inference (feed forward). Note: use `tf.contrib.framework.model_variable` to add to this collection.
  * `TRAINABLE_VARIABLES`: the subset of `Variable` objects that will be trained by an optimizer. See `tf.compat.v1.trainable_variables` for more details.
  * `SUMMARIES`: the summary `Tensor` objects that have been created in the graph. See `tf.compat.v1.summary.merge_all` for more details.
  * `QUEUE_RUNNERS`: the `QueueRunner` objects that are used to produce input for a computation. See `tf.compat.v1.train.start_queue_runners` for more details.
  * `MOVING_AVERAGE_VARIABLES`: the subset of `Variable` objects that will also keep moving averages. See `tf.compat.v1.moving_average_variables` for more details.
  * `REGULARIZATION_LOSSES`: regularization losses collected during graph construction.

The following standard keys are defined, but their collections are not
automatically populated as many of the others are:

  * `WEIGHTS`
  * `BIASES`
  * `ACTIVATIONS`
