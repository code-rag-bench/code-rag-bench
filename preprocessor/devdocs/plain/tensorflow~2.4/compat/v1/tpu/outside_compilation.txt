# tf.compat.v1.tpu.outside_compilation

Builds part of a computation outside any current TPU replicate scope.

    
    tf.compat.v1.tpu.outside_compilation(
        computation, *args, **kwargs
    )
    
`tf.tpu.outside_compilation()` is used to run ops in `computation` on CPU
instead of running on TPU. For example, users can run ops that are not
supported on TPU's (e.g. tf.summary.write()) by explicitly placing those ops
on CPU's. Below usage of outside compilation will place ops in
`computation_with_string_ops` on CPU.

#### Example usage:

    
    def computation_with_string_ops(x):
      # strings types are not supported on TPU's and below ops must
      # run on CPU instead.
      output = tf.strings.format('1{}', x)
      return tf.strings.to_number(output)
    
    def tpu_computation():
      # Expected output is 11.
      output = tf.tpu.outside_compilation(computation_with_string_ops, 1)
    
Outside compilation should be called inside TPUReplicateContext. That is,
`tf.tpu.outside_compilation()` should be called inside a function that is
passed to `tpu.split_compile_and_replicate()` \-- this is implied when outside
compilation is invoked inside a function passed to TPUStrategy `run()`. If
invoked outside of TPUReplicateContext, then this simply returns the result of
`computation`, and therefore, would be a no-op. Note that outside compilation
is different from `tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy.merge_call()` as
logic in outside compilation is replicated and executed separately for each
replica. On the other hand, `merge_call()` requires a `merge_fn` to aggregate
the inputs from different replicas and is executed only once.

For variables placed in TPU device, which includes variables created inside
TPUStrategy scope, outside compilation logic must not include variable
read/write. For variables placed on host, which is the case when variables
created via TPUEstimator, variable read/write is only allowed if the variable
is not accessed by any other ops in the TPU computation. Variable read/write
from outside compilation cluster is not visible from TPU computation and vice
versa. Therefore, if outside compilation logic contains such host variables
read/write ops and if the variables are accessed by TPU computation as well,
then this may lead to deadlock.

Internally, `tf.tpu.outside_compilation()` adds outside compilation attributes
to all ops in `computation`. During later graph pass, these ops with outside
compilation attribute is extracted out and replicated into a host-side graph.
Inputs to this extract host-side graph is sent from TPU computation graph to
host graph via a pair of XlaSendToHost and XlaRecvFromHost ops. Note that
using `tf.tpu.outside_compilation()` may result in tensor transfer between TPU
and CPU, leading to non-trivial performance impact.
