# tf.compat.v1.get_collection

Wrapper for `Graph.get_collection()` using the default graph.

    
    tf.compat.v1.get_collection(
        key, scope=None
    )
    
See `tf.Graph.get_collection` for more details.

Args  
---  
`key` |  The key for the collection. For example, the `GraphKeys` class contains many standard names for collections.   
`scope` |  (Optional.) If supplied, the resulting list is filtered to include only items whose `name` attribute matches using `re.match`. Items without a `name` attribute are never returned if a scope is supplied and the choice or `re.match` means that a `scope` without special tokens filters by prefix.   
Returns  
---  
The list of values in the collection with the given `name`, or an empty list
if no value has been added to that collection. The list contains the values in
the order under which they were collected.  
#### Eager Compatibility

Collections are not supported when eager execution is enabled.
