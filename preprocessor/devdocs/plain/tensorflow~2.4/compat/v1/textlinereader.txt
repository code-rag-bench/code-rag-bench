# tf.compat.v1.TextLineReader

A Reader that outputs the lines of a file delimited by newlines.

Inherits From: `ReaderBase`

    
    tf.compat.v1.TextLineReader(
        skip_header_lines=None, name=None
    )
    
Newlines are stripped from the output. See ReaderBase for supported methods.

Args  
---  
`skip_header_lines` |  An optional int. Defaults to 0. Number of lines to skip from the beginning of every file.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
#### Eager Compatibility

Readers are not compatible with eager execution. Instead, please use `tf.data`
to get data into your model.

Attributes  
---  
`reader_ref` |  Op that implements the reader.   
`supports_serialize` |  Whether the Reader implementation can serialize its state.   
## Methods

### `num_records_produced`

View source

    
    num_records_produced(
        name=None
    )
    
Returns the number of records this reader has produced.

This is the same as the number of Read executions that have succeeded.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
An int64 Tensor.  
### `num_work_units_completed`

View source

    
    num_work_units_completed(
        name=None
    )
    
Returns the number of work units this reader has finished processing.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
An int64 Tensor.  
### `read`

View source

    
    read(
        queue, name=None
    )
    
Returns the next record (key, value) pair produced by a reader.

Will dequeue a work unit from queue if necessary (e.g. when the Reader needs
to start reading from a new file since it has finished with the previous
file).

Args  
---  
`queue` |  A Queue or a mutable string Tensor representing a handle to a Queue, with string work items.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of Tensors (key, value).  
`key` |  A string scalar Tensor.   
`value` |  A string scalar Tensor.   
### `read_up_to`

View source

    
    read_up_to(
        queue, num_records, name=None
    )
    
Returns up to num_records (key, value) pairs produced by a reader.

Will dequeue a work unit from queue if necessary (e.g., when the Reader needs
to start reading from a new file since it has finished with the previous
file). It may return less than num_records even before the last batch.

Args  
---  
`queue` |  A Queue or a mutable string Tensor representing a handle to a Queue, with string work items.   
`num_records` |  Number of records to read.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of Tensors (keys, values).  
`keys` |  A 1-D string Tensor.   
`values` |  A 1-D string Tensor.   
### `reset`

View source

    
    reset(
        name=None
    )
    
Restore a reader to its initial clean state.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The created Operation.  
### `restore_state`

View source

    
    restore_state(
        state, name=None
    )
    
Restore a reader to a previously saved state.

Not all Readers support being restored, so this can produce an Unimplemented
error.

Args  
---  
`state` |  A string Tensor. Result of a SerializeState of a Reader with matching type.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The created Operation.  
### `serialize_state`

View source

    
    serialize_state(
        name=None
    )
    
Produce a string tensor that encodes the state of a reader.

Not all Readers support being serialized, so this can produce an Unimplemented
error.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A string Tensor.
