# tf.compat.v1.cond

Return `true_fn()` if the predicate `pred` is true else `false_fn()`.
(deprecated arguments)

    
    tf.compat.v1.cond(
        pred, true_fn=None, false_fn=None, strict=False, name=None, fn1=None, fn2=None
    )
    
Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(fn1, fn2)`. They will be removed in
a future version. Instructions for updating: fn1/fn2 are deprecated in favor
of the true_fn/false_fn arguments.

`true_fn` and `false_fn` both return lists of output tensors. `true_fn` and
`false_fn` must have the same non-zero number and type of outputs.

Warning: Any Tensors or Operations created outside of `true_fn` and `false_fn`
will be executed regardless of which branch is selected at runtime.

Although this behavior is consistent with the dataflow model of TensorFlow, it
has frequently surprised users who expected a lazier semantics. Consider the
following simple program:

    
    z = tf.multiply(a, b)
    result = tf.cond(x < y, lambda: tf.add(x, z), lambda: tf.square(y))
    
If `x < y`, the `tf.add` operation will be executed and `tf.square` operation
will not be executed. Since `z` is needed for at least one branch of the
`cond`, the `tf.multiply` operation is always executed, unconditionally.

Note that `cond` calls `true_fn` and `false_fn` exactly once (inside the call
to `cond`, and not at all during `Session.run()`). `cond` stitches together
the graph fragments created during the `true_fn` and `false_fn` calls with
some additional graph nodes to ensure that the right branch gets executed
depending on the value of `pred`.

`tf.cond` supports nested structures as implemented in
`tensorflow.python.util.nest`. Both `true_fn` and `false_fn` must return the
same (possibly nested) value structure of lists, tuples, and/or named tuples.
Singleton lists and tuples form the only exceptions to this: when returned by
`true_fn` and/or `false_fn`, they are implicitly unpacked to single values.
This behavior is disabled by passing `strict=True`.

Args  
---  
`pred` |  A scalar determining whether to return the result of `true_fn` or `false_fn`.   
`true_fn` |  The callable to be performed if pred is true.   
`false_fn` |  The callable to be performed if pred is false.   
`strict` |  A boolean that enables/disables 'strict' mode; see above.   
`name` |  Optional name prefix for the returned tensors.   
Returns  
---  
Tensors returned by the call to either `true_fn` or `false_fn`. If the
callables return a singleton list, the element is extracted from the list.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  if `true_fn` or `false_fn` is not callable.   
`ValueError` |  if `true_fn` and `false_fn` do not return the same number of tensors, or return tensors of different types.   
#### Example:

    
    x = tf.constant(2)
    y = tf.constant(5)
    def f1(): return tf.multiply(x, 17)
    def f2(): return tf.add(y, 23)
    r = tf.cond(tf.less(x, y), f1, f2)
    # r is set to f1().
    # Operations in f2 (e.g., tf.add) are not executed.
