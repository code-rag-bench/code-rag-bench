# tf.compat.v1.assign_sub

Update `ref` by subtracting `value` from it.

    
    tf.compat.v1.assign_sub(
        ref, value, use_locking=None, name=None
    )
    
This operation outputs `ref` after the update is done. This makes it easier to
chain operations that need to use the reset value. Unlike `tf.math.subtract`,
this op does not broadcast. `ref` and `value` must have the same shape.

Args  
---  
`ref` |  A mutable `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int64`, `int32`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `int16`, `int8`, `complex64`, `complex128`, `qint8`, `quint8`, `qint32`, `half`. Should be from a `Variable` node.   
`value` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same shape and dtype as `ref`. The value to be subtracted to the variable.   
`use_locking` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. If True, the subtraction will be protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is undefined, but may exhibit less contention.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
Same as "ref". Returned as a convenience for operations that want to use the
new value after the variable has been updated.
