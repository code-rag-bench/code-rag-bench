# tf.compat.v1.variable_axis_size_partitioner

Get a partitioner for VariableScope to keep shards below `max_shard_bytes`.

    
    tf.compat.v1.variable_axis_size_partitioner(
        max_shard_bytes, axis=0, bytes_per_string_element=16, max_shards=None
    )
    
This partitioner will shard a Variable along one axis, attempting to keep the
maximum shard size below `max_shard_bytes`. In practice, this is not always
possible when sharding along only one axis. When this happens, this axis is
sharded as much as possible (i.e., every dimension becomes a separate shard).

If the partitioner hits the `max_shards` limit, then each shard may end up
larger than `max_shard_bytes`. By default `max_shards` equals `None` and no
limit on the number of shards is enforced.

One reasonable value for `max_shard_bytes` is `(64 << 20) - 1`, or almost
`64MB`, to keep below the protobuf byte limit.

Args  
---  
`max_shard_bytes` |  The maximum size any given shard is allowed to be.   
`axis` |  The axis to partition along. Default: outermost axis.   
`bytes_per_string_element` |  If the `Variable` is of type string, this provides an estimate of how large each scalar in the `Variable` is.   
`max_shards` |  The maximum number of shards in int created taking precedence over `max_shard_bytes`.   
Returns  
---  
A partition function usable as the `partitioner` argument to `variable_scope`
and `get_variable`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If any of the byte counts are non-positive.
