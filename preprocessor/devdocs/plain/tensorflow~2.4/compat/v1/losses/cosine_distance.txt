# tf.compat.v1.losses.cosine_distance

Adds a cosine-distance loss to the training procedure. (deprecated arguments)

    
    tf.compat.v1.losses.cosine_distance(
        labels, predictions, axis=None, weights=1.0, scope=None,
        loss_collection=tf.GraphKeys.LOSSES, reduction=Reduction.SUM_BY_NONZERO_WEIGHTS,
        dim=None
    )
    
Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(dim)`. They will be removed in a
future version. Instructions for updating: dim is deprecated, use axis instead

Note that the function assumes that `predictions` and `labels` are already
unit-normalized.

Args  
---  
`labels` |  `Tensor` whose shape matches 'predictions'   
`predictions` |  An arbitrary matrix.   
`axis` |  The dimension along which the cosine distance is computed.   
`weights` |  Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `losses` dimension).   
`scope` |  The scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.   
`loss_collection` |  collection to which this loss will be added.   
`reduction` |  Type of reduction to apply to loss.   
`dim` |  The old (deprecated) name for `axis`.   
Returns  
---  
Weighted loss float `Tensor`. If `reduction` is `NONE`, this has the same
shape as `labels`; otherwise, it is scalar.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `predictions` shape doesn't match `labels` shape, or `axis`, `labels`, `predictions` or `weights` is `None`.   
#### Eager Compatibility

The `loss_collection` argument is ignored when executing eagerly. Consider
holding on to the return value or collecting losses via a `tf.keras.Model`.
