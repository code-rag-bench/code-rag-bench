# tf.compat.v1.losses.sigmoid_cross_entropy

Creates a cross-entropy loss using tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits.

    
    tf.compat.v1.losses.sigmoid_cross_entropy(
        multi_class_labels, logits, weights=1.0, label_smoothing=0, scope=None,
        loss_collection=tf.GraphKeys.LOSSES, reduction=Reduction.SUM_BY_NONZERO_WEIGHTS
    )
    
`weights` acts as a coefficient for the loss. If a scalar is provided, then
the loss is simply scaled by the given value. If `weights` is a tensor of
shape `[batch_size]`, then the loss weights apply to each corresponding
sample.

If `label_smoothing` is nonzero, smooth the labels towards 1/2:

    
    new_multiclass_labels = multiclass_labels * (1 - label_smoothing)
    
                            + 0.5 * label_smoothing
    
Args  
---  
`multi_class_labels` |  `[batch_size, num_classes]` target integer labels in `{0, 1}`.   
`logits` |  Float `[batch_size, num_classes]` logits outputs of the network.   
`weights` |  Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `multi_class_labels`, and must be broadcastable to `multi_class_labels` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `losses` dimension).   
`label_smoothing` |  If greater than `0` then smooth the labels.   
`scope` |  The scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.   
`loss_collection` |  collection to which the loss will be added.   
`reduction` |  Type of reduction to apply to loss.   
Returns  
---  
Weighted loss `Tensor` of the same type as `logits`. If `reduction` is `NONE`,
this has the same shape as `logits`; otherwise, it is scalar.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the shape of `logits` doesn't match that of `multi_class_labels` or if the shape of `weights` is invalid, or if `weights` is None. Also if `multi_class_labels` or `logits` is None.   
#### Eager Compatibility

The `loss_collection` argument is ignored when executing eagerly. Consider
holding on to the return value or collecting losses via a `tf.keras.Model`.
