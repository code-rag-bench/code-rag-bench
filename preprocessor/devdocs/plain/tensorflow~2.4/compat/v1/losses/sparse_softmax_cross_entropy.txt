# tf.compat.v1.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy

Cross-entropy loss using `tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`.

    
    tf.compat.v1.losses.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy(
        labels, logits, weights=1.0, scope=None, loss_collection=tf.GraphKeys.LOSSES,
        reduction=Reduction.SUM_BY_NONZERO_WEIGHTS
    )
    
`weights` acts as a coefficient for the loss. If a scalar is provided, then
the loss is simply scaled by the given value. If `weights` is a tensor of
shape `[batch_size]`, then the loss weights apply to each corresponding
sample.

Args  
---  
`labels` |  `Tensor` of shape `[d_0, d_1, ..., d_{r-1}]` (where `r` is rank of `labels` and result) and dtype `int32` or `int64`. Each entry in `labels` must be an index in `[0, num_classes)`. Other values will raise an exception when this op is run on CPU, and return `NaN` for corresponding loss and gradient rows on GPU.   
`logits` |  Unscaled log probabilities of shape `[d_0, d_1, ..., d_{r-1}, num_classes]` and dtype `float16`, `float32` or `float64`.   
`weights` |  Coefficients for the loss. This must be scalar or broadcastable to `labels` (i.e. same rank and each dimension is either 1 or the same).   
`scope` |  the scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.   
`loss_collection` |  collection to which the loss will be added.   
`reduction` |  Type of reduction to apply to loss.   
Returns  
---  
Weighted loss `Tensor` of the same type as `logits`. If `reduction` is `NONE`,
this has the same shape as `labels`; otherwise, it is scalar.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the shapes of `logits`, `labels`, and `weights` are incompatible, or if any of them are None.   
#### Eager Compatibility

The `loss_collection` argument is ignored when executing eagerly. Consider
holding on to the return value or collecting losses via a `tf.keras.Model`.
