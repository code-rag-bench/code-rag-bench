# tf.compat.v1.losses.mean_squared_error

Adds a Sum-of-Squares loss to the training procedure.

    
    tf.compat.v1.losses.mean_squared_error(
        labels, predictions, weights=1.0, scope=None,
        loss_collection=tf.GraphKeys.LOSSES, reduction=Reduction.SUM_BY_NONZERO_WEIGHTS
    )
    
`weights` acts as a coefficient for the loss. If a scalar is provided, then
the loss is simply scaled by the given value. If `weights` is a tensor of size
`[batch_size]`, then the total loss for each sample of the batch is rescaled
by the corresponding element in the `weights` vector. If the shape of
`weights` matches the shape of `predictions`, then the loss of each measurable
element of `predictions` is scaled by the corresponding value of `weights`.

Args  
---  
`labels` |  The ground truth output tensor, same dimensions as 'predictions'.   
`predictions` |  The predicted outputs.   
`weights` |  Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `losses` dimension).   
`scope` |  The scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.   
`loss_collection` |  collection to which the loss will be added.   
`reduction` |  Type of reduction to apply to loss.   
Returns  
---  
Weighted loss float `Tensor`. If `reduction` is `NONE`, this has the same
shape as `labels`; otherwise, it is scalar.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the shape of `predictions` doesn't match that of `labels` or if the shape of `weights` is invalid. Also if `labels` or `predictions` is None.   
#### Eager Compatibility

The `loss_collection` argument is ignored when executing eagerly. Consider
holding on to the return value or collecting losses via a `tf.keras.Model`.
