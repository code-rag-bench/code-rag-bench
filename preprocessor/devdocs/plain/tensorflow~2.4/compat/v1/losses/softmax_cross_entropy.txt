# tf.compat.v1.losses.softmax_cross_entropy

Creates a cross-entropy loss using tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2.

    
    tf.compat.v1.losses.softmax_cross_entropy(
        onehot_labels, logits, weights=1.0, label_smoothing=0, scope=None,
        loss_collection=tf.GraphKeys.LOSSES, reduction=Reduction.SUM_BY_NONZERO_WEIGHTS
    )
    
`weights` acts as a coefficient for the loss. If a scalar is provided, then
the loss is simply scaled by the given value. If `weights` is a tensor of
shape `[batch_size]`, then the loss weights apply to each corresponding
sample.

If `label_smoothing` is nonzero, smooth the labels towards 1/num_classes:
new_onehot_labels = onehot_labels * (1 - label_smoothing)

    
    + label_smoothing / num_classes
    
Note that `onehot_labels` and `logits` must have the same shape, e.g.
`[batch_size, num_classes]`. The shape of `weights` must be broadcastable to
loss, whose shape is decided by the shape of `logits`. In case the shape of
`logits` is `[batch_size, num_classes]`, loss is a `Tensor` of shape
`[batch_size]`.

Args  
---  
`onehot_labels` |  One-hot-encoded labels.   
`logits` |  Logits outputs of the network.   
`weights` |  Optional `Tensor` that is broadcastable to loss.   
`label_smoothing` |  If greater than 0 then smooth the labels.   
`scope` |  the scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.   
`loss_collection` |  collection to which the loss will be added.   
`reduction` |  Type of reduction to apply to loss.   
Returns  
---  
Weighted loss `Tensor` of the same type as `logits`. If `reduction` is `NONE`,
this has shape `[batch_size]`; otherwise, it is scalar.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the shape of `logits` doesn't match that of `onehot_labels` or if the shape of `weights` is invalid or if `weights` is None. Also if `onehot_labels` or `logits` is None.   
#### Eager Compatibility

The `loss_collection` argument is ignored when executing eagerly. Consider
holding on to the return value or collecting losses via a `tf.keras.Model`.
