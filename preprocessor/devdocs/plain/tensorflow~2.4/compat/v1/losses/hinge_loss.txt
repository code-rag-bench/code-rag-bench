# tf.compat.v1.losses.hinge_loss

Adds a hinge loss to the training procedure.

    
    tf.compat.v1.losses.hinge_loss(
        labels, logits, weights=1.0, scope=None, loss_collection=tf.GraphKeys.LOSSES,
        reduction=Reduction.SUM_BY_NONZERO_WEIGHTS
    )
    
Args  
---  
`labels` |  The ground truth output tensor. Its shape should match the shape of logits. The values of the tensor are expected to be 0.0 or 1.0. Internally the {0,1} labels are converted to {-1,1} when calculating the hinge loss.   
`logits` |  The logits, a float tensor. Note that logits are assumed to be unbounded and 0-centered. A value > 0 (resp. < 0) is considered a positive (resp. negative) binary prediction.   
`weights` |  Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `losses` dimension).   
`scope` |  The scope for the operations performed in computing the loss.   
`loss_collection` |  collection to which the loss will be added.   
`reduction` |  Type of reduction to apply to loss.   
Returns  
---  
Weighted loss float `Tensor`. If `reduction` is `NONE`, this has the same
shape as `labels`; otherwise, it is scalar.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the shapes of `logits` and `labels` don't match or if `labels` or `logits` is None.   
#### Eager Compatibility

The `loss_collection` argument is ignored when executing eagerly. Consider
holding on to the return value or collecting losses via a `tf.keras.Model`.
