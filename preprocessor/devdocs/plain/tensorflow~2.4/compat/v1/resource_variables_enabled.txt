Returns `True` if resource variables are enabled.

    
    tf.compat.v1.resource_variables_enabled()
    
Resource variables are improved versions of TensorFlow variables with a well-
defined memory model. Accessing a resource variable reads its value, and all
ops which access a specific read value of the variable are guaranteed to see
the same value for that tensor. Writes which happen after a read (by having a
control or data dependency on the read) are guaranteed not to affect the value
of the read tensor, and similarly writes which happen before a read are
guaranteed to affect the value. No guarantees are made about unordered
read/write pairs.

Calling tf.enable_resource_variables() lets you opt-in to this TensorFlow 2.0
feature.
