`tf.compat.v1.debugging.assert_near`

    
    tf.compat.v1.assert_near(
        x, y, rtol=None, atol=None, data=None, summarize=None, message=None, name=None
    )
    
Example of adding a dependency to an operation:

    
    with tf.control_dependencies([tf.compat.v1.assert_near(x, y)]):
      output = tf.reduce_sum(x)
    
This condition holds if for every pair of (possibly broadcast) elements
`x[i]`, `y[i]`, we have

`tf.abs(x[i] - y[i]) <= atol + rtol * tf.abs(y[i])`.

If both `x` and `y` are empty, this is trivially satisfied.

The default `atol` and `rtol` is `10 * eps`, where `eps` is the smallest
representable positive number such that `1 + eps != 1`. This is about `1.2e-6`
in `32bit`, `2.22e-15` in `64bit`, and `0.00977` in `16bit`. See
`numpy.finfo`.

Args  
---  
`x` |  Float or complex `Tensor`.   
`y` |  Float or complex `Tensor`, same `dtype` as, and broadcastable to, `x`.   
`rtol` |  `Tensor`. Same `dtype` as, and broadcastable to, `x`. The relative tolerance. Default is `10 * eps`.   
`atol` |  `Tensor`. Same `dtype` as, and broadcastable to, `x`. The absolute tolerance. Default is `10 * eps`.   
`data` |  The tensors to print out if the condition is False. Defaults to error message and first few entries of `x`, `y`.   
`summarize` |  Print this many entries of each tensor.   
`message` |  A string to prefix to the default message.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional). Defaults to "assert_near".   
Returns  
---  
Op that raises `InvalidArgumentError` if `x` and `y` are not close enough.  
#### Numpy Compatibility

Similar to `numpy.testing.assert_allclose`, except tolerance depends on data
type. This is due to the fact that `TensorFlow` is often used with `32bit`,
`64bit`, and even `16bit` data.
