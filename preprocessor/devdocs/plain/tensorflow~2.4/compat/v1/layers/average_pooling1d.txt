# tf.compat.v1.layers.average_pooling1d

Average Pooling layer for 1D inputs.

    
    tf.compat.v1.layers.average_pooling1d(
        inputs, pool_size, strides, padding='valid',
        data_format='channels_last', name=None
    )
    
Arguments  
---  
`inputs` |  The tensor over which to pool. Must have rank 3.   
`pool_size` |  An integer or tuple/list of a single integer, representing the size of the pooling window.   
`strides` |  An integer or tuple/list of a single integer, specifying the strides of the pooling operation.   
`padding` |  A string. The padding method, either 'valid' or 'same'. Case-insensitive.   
`data_format` |  A string, one of `channels_last` (default) or `channels_first`. The ordering of the dimensions in the inputs. `channels_last` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, length, channels)` while `channels_first` corresponds to inputs with shape `(batch, channels, length)`.   
`name` |  A string, the name of the layer.   
Returns  
---  
The output tensor, of rank 3.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if eager execution is enabled.
