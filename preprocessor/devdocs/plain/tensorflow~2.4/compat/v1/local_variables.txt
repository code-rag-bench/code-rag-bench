# tf.compat.v1.local_variables

Returns local variables.

    
    tf.compat.v1.local_variables(
        scope=None
    )
    
Local variables - per process variables, usually not saved/restored to
checkpoint and used for temporary or intermediate values. For example, they
can be used as counters for metrics computation or number of epochs this
machine has read data. The `tf.contrib.framework.local_variable()` function
automatically adds the new variable to `GraphKeys.LOCAL_VARIABLES`. This
convenience function returns the contents of that collection.

An alternative to local variables are global variables. See
`tf.compat.v1.global_variables`

Args  
---  
`scope` |  (Optional.) A string. If supplied, the resulting list is filtered to include only items whose `name` attribute matches `scope` using `re.match`. Items without a `name` attribute are never returned if a scope is supplied. The choice of `re.match` means that a `scope` without special tokens filters by prefix.   
Returns  
---  
A list of local `Variable` objects.
