`tf.compat.v1.sparse.add`

    
    tf.compat.v1.sparse_add(
        a, b, threshold=None, thresh=None
    )
    
Warning: SOME ARGUMENTS ARE DEPRECATED: `(thresh)`. They will be removed in a
future version. Instructions for updating: thresh is deprecated, use threshold
instead

If one `SparseTensor` and one `Tensor` are passed in, returns a `Tensor`. If
both arguments are `SparseTensor`s, this returns a `SparseTensor`. The order
of arguments does not matter. Use vanilla `tf.add()` for adding two dense
`Tensor`s.

The shapes of the two operands must match: broadcasting is not supported.

The indices of any input `SparseTensor` are assumed ordered in standard
lexicographic order. If this is not the case, before this step run
`SparseReorder` to restore index ordering.

If both arguments are sparse, we perform "clipping" as follows. By default, if
two values sum to zero at some index, the output `SparseTensor` would still
include that particular location in its index, storing a zero in the
corresponding value slot. To override this, callers can specify `thresh`,
indicating that if the sum has a magnitude strictly smaller than `thresh`, its
corresponding value and index would then not be included. In particular,
`thresh == 0.0` (default) means everything is kept and actual thresholding
happens only for a positive value.

For example, suppose the logical sum of two sparse operands is (densified):

    
    [       2]
    [.1     0]
    [ 6   -.2]
    
Then,

  * `thresh == 0` (the default): all 5 index/value pairs will be returned.
  * `thresh == 0.11`: only .1 and 0 will vanish, and the remaining three index/value pairs will be returned.
  * `thresh == 0.21`: .1, 0, and -.2 will vanish.

Args  
---  
`a` |  The first operand; `SparseTensor` or `Tensor`.   
`b` |  The second operand; `SparseTensor` or `Tensor`. At least one operand must be sparse.   
`threshold` |  An optional 0-D `Tensor` (defaults to `0`). The magnitude threshold that determines if an output value/index pair takes space. Its dtype should match that of the values if they are real; if the latter are complex64/complex128, then the dtype should be float32/float64, correspondingly.   
`thresh` |  Deprecated alias for `threshold`.   
Returns  
---  
A `SparseTensor` or a `Tensor`, representing the sum.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If both `a` and `b` are `Tensor`s. Use `tf.add()` instead.
