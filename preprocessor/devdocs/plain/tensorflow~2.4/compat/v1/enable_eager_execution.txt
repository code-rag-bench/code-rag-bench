# tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution

Enables eager execution for the lifetime of this program.

    
    tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution(
        config=None, device_policy=None, execution_mode=None
    )
    
Eager execution provides an imperative interface to TensorFlow. With eager
execution enabled, TensorFlow functions execute operations immediately (as
opposed to adding to a graph to be executed later in a `tf.compat.v1.Session`)
and return concrete values (as opposed to symbolic references to a node in a
computational graph).

#### For example:

    
    tf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()
    
    # After eager execution is enabled, operations are executed as they are
    # defined and Tensor objects hold concrete values, which can be accessed as
    # numpy.ndarray`s through the numpy() method.
    assert tf.multiply(6, 7).numpy() == 42
    
Eager execution cannot be enabled after TensorFlow APIs have been used to
create or execute graphs. It is typically recommended to invoke this function
at program startup and not in a library (as most libraries should be usable
both with and without eager execution).

Args  
---  
`config` |  (Optional.) A `tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto` to use to configure the environment in which operations are executed. Note that `tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto` is also used to configure graph execution (via `tf.compat.v1.Session`) and many options within `tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto` are not implemented (or are irrelevant) when eager execution is enabled.   
`device_policy` |  (Optional.) Policy controlling how operations requiring inputs on a specific device (e.g., a GPU 0) handle inputs on a different device (e.g. GPU 1 or CPU). When set to None, an appropriate value will be picked automatically. The value picked may change between TensorFlow releases. Valid values: 
  * tf.contrib.eager.DEVICE_PLACEMENT_EXPLICIT: raises an error if the placement is not correct.
  * tf.contrib.eager.DEVICE_PLACEMENT_WARN: copies the tensors which are not on the right device but logs a warning.
  * tf.contrib.eager.DEVICE_PLACEMENT_SILENT: silently copies the tensors. Note that this may hide performance problems as there is no notification provided when operations are blocked on the tensor being copied between devices.
  * tf.contrib.eager.DEVICE_PLACEMENT_SILENT_FOR_INT32: silently copies int32 tensors, raising errors on the other ones. 

  
`execution_mode` |  (Optional.) Policy controlling how operations dispatched are actually executed. When set to None, an appropriate value will be picked automatically. The value picked may change between TensorFlow releases. Valid values: 
* tf.contrib.eager.SYNC: executes each operation synchronously.
* tf.contrib.eager.ASYNC: executes each operation asynchronously. These operations may return "non-ready" handles.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If eager execution is enabled after creating/executing a TensorFlow graph, or if options provided conflict with a previous call to this function.
