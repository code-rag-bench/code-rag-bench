# tf.nn.conv3d

View source on GitHub  Computes a 3-D convolution given 5-D `input` and
`filters` tensors.

    
    tf.nn.conv3d(
        input, filters, strides, padding, data_format='NDHWC', dilations=None,
        name=None
    )
    
In signal processing, cross-correlation is a measure of similarity of two waveforms as a function of a time-lag applied to one of them. This is also known as a sliding dot product or sliding inner-product. Our Conv3D implements a form of cross-correlation. | Args  
---  
`input` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `bfloat16`, `float32`, `float64`. Shape `[batch, in_depth, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`.   
`filters` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `input`. Shape `[filter_depth, filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`. `in_channels` must match between `input` and `filters`.   
`strides` |  A list of `ints` that has length `>= 5`. 1-D tensor of length 5. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. Must have `strides[0] = strides[4] = 1`.   
`padding` |  A `string` from: `"SAME", "VALID"`. The type of padding algorithm to use.   
`data_format` |  An optional `string` from: `"NDHWC", "NCDHW"`. Defaults to `"NDHWC"`. The data format of the input and output data. With the default format "NDHWC", the data is stored in the order of: [batch, in_depth, in_height, in_width, in_channels]. Alternatively, the format could be "NCDHW", the data storage order is: [batch, in_channels, in_depth, in_height, in_width].   
`dilations` |  An optional list of `ints`. Defaults to `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. 1-D tensor of length 5. The dilation factor for each dimension of `input`. If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`, see above for details. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions must be 1.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `input`.
