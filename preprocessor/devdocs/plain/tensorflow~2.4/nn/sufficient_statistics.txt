# tf.nn.sufficient_statistics

View source on GitHub  Calculate the sufficient statistics for the mean and
variance of `x`.

    
    tf.nn.sufficient_statistics(
        x, axes, shift=None, keepdims=False, name=None
    )
    
These sufficient statistics are computed using the one pass algorithm on an input that's optionally shifted. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Computing_shifted_data | Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`.   
`axes` |  Array of ints. Axes along which to compute mean and variance.   
`shift` |  A `Tensor` containing the value by which to shift the data for numerical stability, or `None` if no shift is to be performed. A shift close to the true mean provides the most numerically stable results.   
`keepdims` |  produce statistics with the same dimensionality as the input.   
`name` |  Name used to scope the operations that compute the sufficient stats.   
Returns  
---  
Four `Tensor` objects of the same type as `x`:

  * the count (number of elements to average over).
  * the (possibly shifted) sum of the elements in the array.
  * the (possibly shifted) sum of squares of the elements in the array.
  * the shift by which the mean must be corrected or None if `shift` is None.
