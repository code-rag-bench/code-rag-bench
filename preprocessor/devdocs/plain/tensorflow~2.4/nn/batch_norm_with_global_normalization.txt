This op is deprecated. See `tf.nn.batch_normalization`. | Args  
---  
`input` |  A 4D input Tensor.   
`mean` |  A 1D mean Tensor with size matching the last dimension of t. This is the first output from tf.nn.moments, or a saved moving average thereof.   
`variance` |  A 1D variance Tensor with size matching the last dimension of t. This is the second output from tf.nn.moments, or a saved moving average thereof.   
`beta` |  A 1D beta Tensor with size matching the last dimension of t. An offset to be added to the normalized tensor.   
`gamma` |  A 1D gamma Tensor with size matching the last dimension of t. If "scale_after_normalization" is true, this tensor will be multiplied with the normalized tensor.   
`variance_epsilon` |  A small float number to avoid dividing by 0.   
`scale_after_normalization` |  A bool indicating whether the resulted tensor needs to be multiplied with gamma.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A batch-normalized `t`.
