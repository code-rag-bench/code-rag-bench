    tf.nn.avg_pool(
        input, ksize, strides, padding, data_format=None, name=None
    )
    
Each entry in `output` is the mean of the corresponding size `ksize` window in `value`. | Args  
---  
`input` |  Tensor of rank N+2, of shape `[batch_size] + input_spatial_shape + [num_channels]` if `data_format` does not start with "NC" (default), or `[batch_size, num_channels] + input_spatial_shape` if data_format starts with "NC". Pooling happens over the spatial dimensions only.   
`ksize` |  An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `N` or `N+2`. The size of the window for each dimension of the input tensor.   
`strides` |  An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `N` or `N+2`. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of the input tensor.   
`padding` |  A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See the "returns" section of `tf.nn.convolution` for details.   
`data_format` |  A string. Specifies the channel dimension. For N=1 it can be either "NWC" (default) or "NCW", for N=2 it can be either "NHWC" (default) or "NCHW" and for N=3 either "NDHWC" (default) or "NCDHW".   
`name` |  Optional name for the operation.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of format specified by `data_format`. The average pooled output
tensor.
