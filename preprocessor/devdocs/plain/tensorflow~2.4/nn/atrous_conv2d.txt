    tf.nn.atrous_conv2d(
        value, filters, rate, padding, name=None
    )
    
This function is a simpler wrapper around the more general
`tf.nn.convolution`, and exists only for backwards compatibility. You can use
`tf.nn.convolution` to perform 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D atrous convolution. Computes a
2-D atrous convolution, also known as convolution with holes or dilated
convolution, given 4-D `value` and `filters` tensors. If the `rate` parameter
is equal to one, it performs regular 2-D convolution. If the `rate` parameter
is greater than one, it performs convolution with holes, sampling the input
values every `rate` pixels in the `height` and `width` dimensions. This is
equivalent to convolving the input with a set of upsampled filters, produced
by inserting `rate - 1` zeros between two consecutive values of the filters
along the `height` and `width` dimensions, hence the name atrous convolution
or convolution with holes (the French word trous means holes in English).

#### More specifically:

    
    output[batch, height, width, out_channel] =
        sum_{dheight, dwidth, in_channel} (
            filters[dheight, dwidth, in_channel, out_channel] *
            value[batch, height + rate*dheight, width + rate*dwidth, in_channel]
        )
    
Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control how densely to compute
feature responses in fully convolutional networks. Used in conjunction with
bilinear interpolation, it offers an alternative to `conv2d_transpose` in
dense prediction tasks such as semantic image segmentation, optical flow
computation, or depth estimation. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the
field of view of filters without increasing the number of parameters or the
amount of computation. For a description of atrous convolution and how it can
be used for dense feature extraction, please see: (Chen et al., 2015). The
same operation is investigated further in (Yu et al., 2016). Previous works
that effectively use atrous convolution in different ways are, among others,
(Sermanet et al., 2014) and (Giusti et al., 2013). Atrous convolution is also
closely related to the so-called noble identities in multi-rate signal
processing. There are many different ways to implement atrous convolution (see
the refs above). The implementation here reduces

    
    atrous_conv2d(value, filters, rate, padding=padding)
    
to the following three operations:

    
    paddings = ...
    net = space_to_batch(value, paddings, block_size=rate)
    net = conv2d(net, filters, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="VALID")
    crops = ...
    net = batch_to_space(net, crops, block_size=rate)
    
Advanced usage. Note the following optimization: A sequence of `atrous_conv2d`
operations with identical `rate` parameters, 'SAME' `padding`, and filters
with odd heights/ widths:

    
    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters1, rate, padding="SAME")
    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filters2, rate, padding="SAME")
    ...
    net = atrous_conv2d(net, filtersK, rate, padding="SAME")
    
can be equivalently performed cheaper in terms of computation and memory as:

    
    pad = ...  # padding so that the input dims are multiples of rate
    net = space_to_batch(net, paddings=pad, block_size=rate)
    net = conv2d(net, filters1, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
    net = conv2d(net, filters2, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
    ...
    net = conv2d(net, filtersK, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME")
    net = batch_to_space(net, crops=pad, block_size=rate)
    
because a pair of consecutive `space_to_batch` and `batch_to_space` ops with the same `block_size` cancel out when their respective `paddings` and `crops` inputs are identical. | Args  
---  
`value` |  A 4-D `Tensor` of type `float`. It needs to be in the default "NHWC" format. Its shape is `[batch, in_height, in_width, in_channels]`.   
`filters` |  A 4-D `Tensor` with the same type as `value` and shape `[filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`. `filters`' `in_channels` dimension must match that of `value`. Atrous convolution is equivalent to standard convolution with upsampled filters with effective height `filter_height + (filter_height - 1) * (rate - 1)` and effective width `filter_width + (filter_width - 1) * (rate - 1)`, produced by inserting `rate - 1` zeros along consecutive elements across the `filters`' spatial dimensions.   
`rate` |  A positive int32. The stride with which we sample input values across the `height` and `width` dimensions. Equivalently, the rate by which we upsample the filter values by inserting zeros across the `height` and `width` dimensions. In the literature, the same parameter is sometimes called `input stride` or `dilation`.   
`padding` |  A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm.   
`name` |  Optional name for the returned tensor.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`. Output shape with `'VALID'` padding
is: [batch, height - 2 * (filter_width - 1), width - 2 * (filter_height - 1),
out_channels]. Output shape with `'SAME'` padding is: [batch, height, width,
out_channels].  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If input/output depth does not match `filters`' shape, or if padding is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.
