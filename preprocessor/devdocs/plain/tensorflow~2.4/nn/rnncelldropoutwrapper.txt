# tf.nn.RNNCellDropoutWrapper

Operator adding dropout to inputs and outputs of the given cell.

Inherits From: `AbstractRNNCell`, `Layer`, `Module`

    
    tf.nn.RNNCellDropoutWrapper(
        *args, **kwargs
    )
    
Args  
---  
`cell` |  an RNNCell, a projection to output_size is added to it.   
`input_keep_prob` |  unit Tensor or float between 0 and 1, input keep probability; if it is constant and 1, no input dropout will be added.   
`output_keep_prob` |  unit Tensor or float between 0 and 1, output keep probability; if it is constant and 1, no output dropout will be added.   
`state_keep_prob` |  unit Tensor or float between 0 and 1, output keep probability; if it is constant and 1, no output dropout will be added. State dropout is performed on the outgoing states of the cell. Note the state components to which dropout is applied when `state_keep_prob` is in `(0, 1)` are also determined by the argument `dropout_state_filter_visitor` (e.g. by default dropout is never applied to the `c` component of an `LSTMStateTuple`).   
`variational_recurrent` |  Python bool. If `True`, then the same dropout pattern is applied across all time steps per run call. If this parameter is set, `input_size` must be provided.   
`input_size` |  (optional) (possibly nested tuple of) `TensorShape` objects containing the depth(s) of the input tensors expected to be passed in to the `DropoutWrapper`. Required and used iff `variational_recurrent = True` and `input_keep_prob < 1`.   
`dtype` |  (optional) The `dtype` of the input, state, and output tensors. Required and used iff `variational_recurrent = True`.   
`seed` |  (optional) integer, the randomness seed.   
`dropout_state_filter_visitor` |  (optional), default: (see below). Function that takes any hierarchical level of the state and returns a scalar or depth=1 structure of Python booleans describing which terms in the state should be dropped out. In addition, if the function returns `True`, dropout is applied across this sublevel. If the function returns `False`, dropout is not applied across this entire sublevel. Default behavior: perform dropout on all terms except the memory (`c`) state of `LSTMCellState` objects, and don't try to apply dropout to `TensorArray` objects: `def dropout_state_filter_visitor(s): if isinstance(s, LSTMCellState): # Never perform dropout on the c state. return LSTMCellState(c=False, h=True) elif isinstance(s, TensorArray): return False return True`  
`**kwargs` |  dict of keyword arguments for base layer.   
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  if `cell` is not an `RNNCell`, or `keep_state_fn` is provided but not `callable`.   
`ValueError` |  if any of the keep_probs are not between 0 and 1.   
Attributes  
---  
`output_size` |   
`state_size` |   
`wrapped_cell` |
