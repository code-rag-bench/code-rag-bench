# tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits

View source on GitHub  Computes sparse softmax cross entropy between `logits`
and `labels`.

    
    tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(
        labels, logits, name=None
    )
    
Measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which the
classes are mutually exclusive (each entry is in exactly one class). For
example, each CIFAR-10 image is labeled with one and only one label: an image
can be a dog or a truck, but not both.

> Note: For this operation, the probability of a given label is considered
> exclusive. That is, soft classes are not allowed, and the `labels` vector
> must provide a single specific index for the true class for each row of
> `logits` (each minibatch entry). For soft softmax classification with a
> probability distribution for each entry, see
> `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2`.
Warning: This op expects unscaled logits, since it performs a `softmax` on `logits` internally for efficiency. Do not call this op with the output of `softmax`, as it will produce incorrect results. A common use case is to have logits of shape `[batch_size, num_classes]` and have labels of shape `[batch_size]`, but higher dimensions are supported, in which case the `dim`-th dimension is assumed to be of size `num_classes`. `logits` must have the dtype of `float16`, `float32`, or `float64`, and `labels` must have the dtype of `int32` or `int64`. Note that to avoid confusion, it is required to pass only named arguments to this function. | Args  
---  
`labels` |  `Tensor` of shape `[d_0, d_1, ..., d_{r-1}]` (where `r` is rank of `labels` and result) and dtype `int32` or `int64`. Each entry in `labels` must be an index in `[0, num_classes)`. Other values will raise an exception when this op is run on CPU, and return `NaN` for corresponding loss and gradient rows on GPU.   
`logits` |  Unscaled log probabilities of shape `[d_0, d_1, ..., d_{r-1}, num_classes]` and dtype `float16`, `float32`, or `float64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of the same shape as `labels` and of the same type as `logits` with
the softmax cross entropy loss.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If logits are scalars (need to have rank >= 1) or if the rank of the labels is not equal to the rank of the logits minus one.
