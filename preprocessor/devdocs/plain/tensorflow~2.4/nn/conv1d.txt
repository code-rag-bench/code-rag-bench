# tf.nn.conv1d

View source on GitHub  Computes a 1-D convolution given 3-D input and filter
tensors.

    
    tf.nn.conv1d(
        input, filters, stride, padding, data_format='NWC', dilations=None,
        name=None
    )
    
Given an input tensor of shape `batch_shape + [in_width, in_channels]` if `data_format` is `"NWC"`, or `batch_shape + [in_channels, in_width]` if `data_format` is `"NCW"`, and a filter / kernel tensor of shape `[filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`, this op reshapes the arguments to pass them to `conv2d` to perform the equivalent convolution operation. Internally, this op reshapes the input tensors and invokes `tf.nn.conv2d`. For example, if `data_format` does not start with `"NC"`, a tensor of shape `batch_shape + [in_width, in_channels]` is reshaped to `batch_shape + [1, in_width, in_channels]`, and the filter is reshaped to `[1, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels]`. The result is then reshaped back to `batch_shape + [out_width, out_channels]` (where out_width is a function of the stride and padding as in conv2d) and returned to the caller. | Args  
---  
`input` |  A Tensor of rank at least 3. Must be of type `float16`, `float32`, or `float64`.   
`filters` |  A Tensor of rank at least 3. Must have the same type as `input`.   
`stride` |  An int or list of `ints` that has length `1` or `3`. The number of entries by which the filter is moved right at each step.   
`padding` |  'SAME' or 'VALID'   
`data_format` |  An optional `string` from `"NWC", "NCW"`. Defaults to `"NWC"`, the data is stored in the order of `batch_shape + [in_width, in_channels]`. The `"NCW"` format stores data as `batch_shape + [in_channels, in_width]`.   
`dilations` |  An int or list of `ints` that has length `1` or `3` which defaults to 1. The dilation factor for each dimension of input. If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension. Dilations in the batch and depth dimensions must be 1.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as input.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if `data_format` is invalid.
