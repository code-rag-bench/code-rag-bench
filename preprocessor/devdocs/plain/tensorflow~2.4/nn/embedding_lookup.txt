# tf.nn.embedding_lookup

View source on GitHub  Looks up embeddings for the given `ids` from a list of
tensors.

    
    tf.nn.embedding_lookup(
        params, ids, max_norm=None, name=None
    )
    
This function is used to perform parallel lookups on the list of tensors in `params`. It is a generalization of `tf.gather`, where `params` is interpreted as a partitioning of a large embedding tensor. If `len(params) > 1`, each element `id` of `ids` is partitioned between the elements of `params` according to the "div" partition strategy, which means we assign ids to partitions in a contiguous manner. For instance, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as: `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]`. If the id space does not evenly divide the number of partitions, each of the first `(max_id + 1) % len(params)` partitions will be assigned one more id. The results of the lookup are concatenated into a dense tensor. The returned tensor has shape `shape(ids) + shape(params)[1:]`. | Args  
---  
`params` |  A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a list of tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension, representing sharded embedding tensors following "div" partition strategy.   
`ids` |  A `Tensor` with type `int32` or `int64` containing the ids to be looked up in `params`.   
`max_norm` |  If not `None`, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger than this value.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same type as the tensors in `params`. For instance, if
`params` is a 5x2 matrix:

    
    [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]]
    
or a list of matrices:

    
    params[0]: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    params[1]: [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
    params[2]: [[9, 10]]
    
and `ids` is:

    
    [0, 3, 4]
    
The output will be a 3x2 matrix:

    
    [[1, 2], [7, 8], [9, 10]]
      
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `params` is empty.
