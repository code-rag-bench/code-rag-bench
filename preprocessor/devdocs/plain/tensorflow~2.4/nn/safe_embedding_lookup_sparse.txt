View source on GitHub  Lookup embedding results, accounting for invalid IDs
and empty features.

    
    tf.nn.safe_embedding_lookup_sparse(
        embedding_weights, sparse_ids, sparse_weights=None, combiner='mean',
        default_id=None, max_norm=None, name=None
    )
    
The partitioned embedding in `embedding_weights` must all be the same shape except for the first dimension. The first dimension is allowed to vary as the vocabulary size is not necessarily a multiple of num of shards. Invalid IDs (< 0) are pruned from input IDs and weights, as well as any IDs with non-positive weight. For an entry with no features, the embedding vector for `default_id` is returned, or the 0-vector if `default_id` is not supplied. The ids and weights may be multi-dimensional. Embeddings are always aggregated along the last dimension. If `len(embedding_weights) > 1`, each element `id` of `ids` is partitioned between the elements of `embedding_weights` according to the "div" partition strategy, which means we assign ids to partitions in a contiguous manner. For instance, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as: `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]`. If the id space does not evenly divide the number of partitions, each of the first `(max_id + 1) % len(embedding_weights)` partitions will be assigned one more id. | Args  
---  
`embedding_weights` |  A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a list of tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension, representing sharded embedding tensors following "div" partition strategy.   
`sparse_ids` |  `SparseTensor` of shape `[d_0, d_1, ..., d_n]` containing the ids. `d_0` is typically batch size.   
`sparse_weights` |  `SparseTensor` of same shape as `sparse_ids`, containing float weights corresponding to `sparse_ids`, or `None` if all weights are be assumed to be 1.0.   
`combiner` |  A string specifying how to combine embedding results for each entry. Currently "mean", "sqrtn" and "sum" are supported, with "mean" the default.   
`default_id` |  The id to use for an entry with no features. Defaults to 0-vector.   
`max_norm` |  If not `None`, all embeddings are l2-normalized to max_norm before combining.   
`name` |  A name for this operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A dense tensor representing the combined embeddings for the sparse ids. For
each row in the dense tensor represented by `sparse_ids`, the op looks up the
embeddings for all ids in that row, multiplies them by the corresponding
weight, and combines these embeddings as specified. In other words, if
`shape(combined embedding_weights) = [p0, p1, ..., pm]` and `shape(sparse_ids)
= shape(sparse_weights) = [d0, d1, ..., dn]` then `shape(output) = [d0, d1,
... dn-1, p1, ..., pm]`. For instance, if params is a 10x20 matrix, and sp_ids
/ sp_weights are

    
    [0, 0]: id 1, weight 2.0
    [0, 1]: id 3, weight 0.5
    [1, 0]: id -1, weight 1.0
    [2, 3]: id 1, weight 3.0
    
`default_id` is 0. with `combiner`="mean", then the output will be a 3x20
matrix where

    
    output[0, :] = (params[1, :] * 2.0 + params[3, :] * 0.5) / (2.0 + 0.5)
    output[1, :] = (params[0, :] * 1.0) / 1.0
    output[2, :] = (params[1, :] * 3.0) / 3.0
      
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if `embedding_weights` is empty.
