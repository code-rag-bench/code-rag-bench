    tf.nn.compute_accidental_hits(
        true_classes, sampled_candidates, num_true, seed=None, name=None
    )
    
In Candidate Sampling, this operation facilitates virtually removing sampled classes which happen to match target classes. This is done in Sampled Softmax and Sampled Logistic. See our Candidate Sampling Algorithms Reference. We presuppose that the `sampled_candidates` are unique. We call it an 'accidental hit' when one of the target classes matches one of the sampled classes. This operation reports accidental hits as triples `(index, id, weight)`, where `index` represents the row number in `true_classes`, `id` represents the position in `sampled_candidates`, and weight is `-FLOAT_MAX`. The result of this op should be passed through a `sparse_to_dense` operation, then added to the logits of the sampled classes. This removes the contradictory effect of accidentally sampling the true target classes as noise classes for the same example. | Args  
---  
`true_classes` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size, num_true]`. The target classes.   
`sampled_candidates` |  A tensor of type `int64` and shape `[num_sampled]`. The sampled_candidates output of CandidateSampler.   
`num_true` |  An `int`. The number of target classes per training example.   
`seed` |  An `int`. An operation-specific seed. Default is 0.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
`indices` |  A `Tensor` of type `int32` and shape `[num_accidental_hits]`. Values indicate rows in `true_classes`.   
`ids` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[num_accidental_hits]`. Values indicate positions in `sampled_candidates`.   
`weights` |  A `Tensor` of type `float` and shape `[num_accidental_hits]`. Each value is `-FLOAT_MAX`.
