# tf.nn.fractional_avg_pool

View source on GitHub  Performs fractional average pooling on the input.

    
    tf.nn.fractional_avg_pool(
        value, pooling_ratio, pseudo_random=False, overlapping=False, seed=0, name=None
    )
    
Fractional average pooling is similar to Fractional max pooling in the pooling region generation step. The only difference is that after pooling regions are generated, a mean operation is performed instead of a max operation in each pooling region. | Args  
---  
`value` |  A `Tensor`. 4-D with shape `[batch, height, width, channels]`.   
`pooling_ratio` |  A list of `floats` that has length >= 4. Pooling ratio for each dimension of `value`, currently only supports row and col dimension and should be >= 1.0. For example, a valid pooling ratio looks like [1.0, 1.44, 1.73, 1.0]. The first and last elements must be 1.0 because we don't allow pooling on batch and channels dimensions. 1.44 and 1.73 are pooling ratio on height and width dimensions respectively.   
`pseudo_random` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. When set to `True`, generates the pooling sequence in a pseudorandom fashion, otherwise, in a random fashion. Check paper (Graham, 2015) for difference between pseudorandom and random.   
`overlapping` |  An optional `bool`. Defaults to `False`. When set to `True`, it means when pooling, the values at the boundary of adjacent pooling cells are used by both cells. For example: `index 0 1 2 3 4` `value 20 5 16 3 7` If the pooling sequence is [0, 2, 4], then 16, at index 2 will be used twice. The result would be [20, 16] for fractional avg pooling.   
`seed` |  An optional `int`. Defaults to `0`. If set to be non-zero, the random number generator is seeded by the given seed. Otherwise it is seeded by a random seed.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A tuple of `Tensor` objects (`output`, `row_pooling_sequence`,
`col_pooling_sequence`). output: Output `Tensor` after fractional avg pooling.
Has the same type as `value`. row_pooling_sequence: A `Tensor` of type
`int64`. col_pooling_sequence: A `Tensor` of type `int64`.
