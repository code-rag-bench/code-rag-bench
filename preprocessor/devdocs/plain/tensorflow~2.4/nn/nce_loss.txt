# tf.nn.nce_loss

View source on GitHub  Computes and returns the noise-contrastive estimation
training loss.

    
    tf.nn.nce_loss(
        weights, biases, labels, inputs, num_sampled, num_classes, num_true=1,
        sampled_values=None, remove_accidental_hits=False, name='nce_loss'
    )
    
See Noise-contrastive estimation: A new estimation principle for unnormalized
statistical models. Also see our Candidate Sampling Algorithms Reference A
common use case is to use this method for training, and calculate the full
sigmoid loss for evaluation or inference as in the following example:

    
    if mode == "train":
      loss = tf.nn.nce_loss(
          weights=weights,
          biases=biases,
          labels=labels,
          inputs=inputs,
          ...)
    elif mode == "eval":
      logits = tf.matmul(inputs, tf.transpose(weights))
      logits = tf.nn.bias_add(logits, biases)
      labels_one_hot = tf.one_hot(labels, n_classes)
      loss = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(
          labels=labels_one_hot,
          logits=logits)
      loss = tf.reduce_sum(loss, axis=1)
    
> Note: when doing embedding lookup on `weights` and `bias`, "div" partition

> Note: In the case where `num_true` > 1, we assign to each target class the
> target probability 1 / `num_true` so that the target probabilities sum to 1

> Note: It would be useful to allow a variable number of target classes per
> example. We hope to provide this functionality in a future release. For now,
> if you have a variable number of target classes, you can pad them out to a
> constant number by either repeating them or by padding with an otherwise
> unused class.
| Args  
---  
`weights` |  A `Tensor` of shape `[num_classes, dim]`, or a list of `Tensor` objects whose concatenation along dimension 0 has shape [num_classes, dim]. The (possibly-partitioned) class embeddings.   
`biases` |  A `Tensor` of shape `[num_classes]`. The class biases.   
`labels` |  A `Tensor` of type `int64` and shape `[batch_size, num_true]`. The target classes.   
`inputs` |  A `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, dim]`. The forward activations of the input network.   
`num_sampled` |  An `int`. The number of negative classes to randomly sample per batch. This single sample of negative classes is evaluated for each element in the batch.   
`num_classes` |  An `int`. The number of possible classes.   
`num_true` |  An `int`. The number of target classes per training example.   
`sampled_values` |  a tuple of (`sampled_candidates`, `true_expected_count`, `sampled_expected_count`) returned by a `*_candidate_sampler` function. (if None, we default to `log_uniform_candidate_sampler`)   
`remove_accidental_hits` |  A `bool`. Whether to remove "accidental hits" where a sampled class equals one of the target classes. If set to `True`, this is a "Sampled Logistic" loss instead of NCE, and we are learning to generate log-odds instead of log probabilities. See our Candidate Sampling Algorithms Reference. Default is False.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `batch_size` 1-D tensor of per-example NCE losses.
