# tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse

View source on GitHub  Looks up embeddings for the given ids and weights from
a list of tensors.

    
    tf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse(
        params, sp_ids, sp_weights, combiner=None, max_norm=None, name=None
    )
    
This op assumes that there is at least one id for each row in the dense tensor represented by sp_ids (i.e. there are no rows with empty features), and that all the indices of sp_ids are in canonical row-major order. `sp_ids` and `sp_weights` (if not None) are `SparseTensor`s with rank of 2. Embeddings are always aggregated along the last dimension. It also assumes that all id values lie in the range [0, p0), where p0 is the sum of the size of params along dimension 0. If `len(params) > 1`, each element of `sp_ids` is partitioned between the elements of `params` according to the "div" partition strategy, which means we assign ids to partitions in a contiguous manner. For instance, 13 ids are split across 5 partitions as: `[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]]`. If the id space does not evenly divide the number of partitions, each of the first `(max_id + 1) % len(params)` partitions will be assigned one more id. | Args  
---  
`params` |  A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor, or a list of tensors all of same shape except for the first dimension, representing sharded embedding tensors following "div" partition strategy.   
`sp_ids` |  N x M `SparseTensor` of int64 ids where N is typically batch size and M is arbitrary.   
`sp_weights` |  either a `SparseTensor` of float / double weights, or `None` to indicate all weights should be taken to be 1. If specified, `sp_weights` must have exactly the same shape and indices as `sp_ids`.   
`combiner` |  A string specifying the reduction op. Currently "mean", "sqrtn" and "sum" are supported. "sum" computes the weighted sum of the embedding results for each row. "mean" is the weighted sum divided by the total weight. "sqrtn" is the weighted sum divided by the square root of the sum of the squares of the weights. Defaults to `mean`.   
`max_norm` |  If not `None`, each embedding is clipped if its l2-norm is larger than this value, before combining.   
`name` |  Optional name for the op.   
Returns  
---  
A dense tensor representing the combined embeddings for the sparse ids. For
each row in the dense tensor represented by `sp_ids`, the op looks up the
embeddings for all ids in that row, multiplies them by the corresponding
weight, and combines these embeddings as specified. In other words, if
`shape(combined params) = [p0, p1, ..., pm]` and `shape(sp_ids) =
shape(sp_weights) = [d0, d1]` then `shape(output) = [d0, p1, ..., pm]`. For
instance, if params is a 10x20 matrix, and sp_ids / sp_weights are

    
    [0, 0]: id 1, weight 2.0
    [0, 1]: id 3, weight 0.5
    [1, 0]: id 0, weight 1.0
    [2, 3]: id 1, weight 3.0
    
with `combiner`="mean", then the output will be a 3x20 matrix where

    
    output[0, :] = (params[1, :] * 2.0 + params[3, :] * 0.5) / (2.0 + 0.5)
    output[1, :] = (params[0, :] * 1.0) / 1.0
    output[2, :] = (params[1, :] * 3.0) / 3.0
      
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `sp_ids` is not a `SparseTensor`, or if `sp_weights` is neither `None` nor `SparseTensor`.   
`ValueError` |  If `combiner` is not one of {"mean", "sqrtn", "sum"}.
