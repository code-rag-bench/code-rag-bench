# tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits

View source on GitHub  Computes sigmoid cross entropy given `logits`.

    
    tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(
        labels=None, logits=None, name=None
    )
    
Measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which each
class is independent and not mutually exclusive. For instance, one could
perform multilabel classification where a picture can contain both an elephant
and a dog at the same time. For brevity, let `x = logits`, `z = labels`. The
logistic loss is

    
      z * -log(sigmoid(x)) + (1 - z) * -log(1 - sigmoid(x))
    = z * -log(1 / (1 + exp(-x))) + (1 - z) * -log(exp(-x) / (1 + exp(-x)))
    = z * log(1 + exp(-x)) + (1 - z) * (-log(exp(-x)) + log(1 + exp(-x)))
    = z * log(1 + exp(-x)) + (1 - z) * (x + log(1 + exp(-x))
    = (1 - z) * x + log(1 + exp(-x))
    = x - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))
    
For x < 0, to avoid overflow in exp(-x), we reformulate the above

    
      x - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))
    = log(exp(x)) - x * z + log(1 + exp(-x))
    = - x * z + log(1 + exp(x))
    
Hence, to ensure stability and avoid overflow, the implementation uses this
equivalent formulation

    
    max(x, 0) - x * z + log(1 + exp(-abs(x)))
    
`logits` and `labels` must have the same type and shape. | Args  
---  
`labels` |  A `Tensor` of the same type and shape as `logits`.   
`logits` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32` or `float64`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of the same shape as `logits` with the componentwise logistic
losses.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `logits` and `labels` do not have the same shape.
