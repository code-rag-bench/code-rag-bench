# tf.nn.erosion2d

View source on GitHub  Computes the grayscale erosion of 4-D `value` and 3-D
`filters` tensors.

    
    tf.nn.erosion2d(
        value, filters, strides, padding, data_format, dilations, name=None
    )
    
The `value` tensor has shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, depth]` and the
`filters` tensor has shape `[filters_height, filters_width, depth]`, i.e.,
each input channel is processed independently of the others with its own
structuring function. The `output` tensor has shape `[batch, out_height,
out_width, depth]`. The spatial dimensions of the output tensor depend on the
`padding` algorithm. We currently only support the default "NHWC"
`data_format`. In detail, the grayscale morphological 2-D erosion is given by:

    
    output[b, y, x, c] =
       min_{dy, dx} value[b,
                          strides[1] * y - dilations[1] * dy,
                          strides[2] * x - dilations[2] * dx,
                          c] -
                    filters[dy, dx, c]
    
Duality: The erosion of `value` by the `filters` is equal to the negation of the dilation of `-value` by the reflected `filters`. | Args  
---  
`value` |  A `Tensor`. 4-D with shape `[batch, in_height, in_width, depth]`.   
`filters` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `value`. 3-D with shape `[filters_height, filters_width, depth]`.   
`strides` |  A list of `ints` that has length `>= 4`. 1-D of length 4. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of the input tensor. Must be: `[1, stride_height, stride_width, 1]`.   
`padding` |  A `string` from: `"SAME", "VALID"`. The type of padding algorithm to use.   
`data_format` |  A `string`, only `"NHWC"` is currently supported.   
`dilations` |  A list of `ints` that has length `>= 4`. 1-D of length 4. The input stride for atrous morphological dilation. Must be: `[1, rate_height, rate_width, 1]`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional). If not specified "erosion2d" is used.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `value`. 4-D with shape `[batch, out_height,
out_width, depth]`.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If the `value` depth does not match `filters`' shape, or if padding is other than `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`.
