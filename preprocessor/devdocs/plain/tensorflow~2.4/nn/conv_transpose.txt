`tf.compat.v1.nn.conv_transpose`

    
    tf.nn.conv_transpose(
        input, filters, output_shape, strides, padding='SAME',
        data_format=None, dilations=None, name=None
    )
    
This operation is sometimes called "deconvolution" after (Zeiler et al., 2010), but is really the transpose (gradient) of `conv3d` rather than an actual deconvolution. | Args  
---  
`input` |  An N+2 dimensional `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size] + input_spatial_shape + [in_channels]` if data_format does not start with "NC" (default), or `[batch_size, in_channels] + input_spatial_shape` if data_format starts with "NC". It must be one of the following types: `half`, `bfloat16`, `float32`, `float64`.   
`filters` |  An N+2 dimensional `Tensor` with the same type as `input` and shape `spatial_filter_shape + [in_channels, out_channels]`.   
`output_shape` |  A 1-D `Tensor` representing the output shape of the deconvolution op.   
`strides` |  An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `N` or `N+2`. The stride of the sliding window for each dimension of `input`. If a single value is given it is replicated in the spatial dimensions. By default the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 0. The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`, see below for details.   
`padding` |  A string, either `'VALID'` or `'SAME'`. The padding algorithm. See the "returns" section of `tf.nn.convolution` for details.   
`data_format` |  A string or None. Specifies whether the channel dimension of the `input` and output is the last dimension (default, or if `data_format` does not start with "NC"), or the second dimension (if `data_format` starts with "NC"). For N=1, the valid values are "NWC" (default) and "NCW". For N=2, the valid values are "NHWC" (default) and "NCHW". For N=3, the valid values are "NDHWC" (default) and "NCDHW".   
`dilations` |  An int or list of `ints` that has length `1`, `N` or `N+2`, defaults to 1. The dilation factor for each dimension of`input`. If a single value is given it is replicated in the spatial dimensions. By default the `N` and `C` dimensions are set to 1. If set to k > 1, there will be k-1 skipped cells between each filter element on that dimension. The dimension order is determined by the value of `data_format`, see above for details.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional). If not specified "conv_transpose" is used.   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` with the same type as `value`.
