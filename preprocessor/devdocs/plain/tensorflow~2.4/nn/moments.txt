# tf.nn.moments

View source on GitHub  Calculates the mean and variance of `x`.

    
    tf.nn.moments(
        x, axes, shift=None, keepdims=False, name=None
    )
    
The mean and variance are calculated by aggregating the contents of `x` across
`axes`. If `x` is 1-D and `axes = [0]` this is just the mean and variance of a
vector.

> Note: shift is currently not used; the true mean is computed and used.
When using these moments for batch normalization (see
`tf.nn.batch_normalization`):

  * for so-called "global normalization", used with convolutional filters with shape `[batch, height, width, depth]`, pass `axes=[0, 1, 2]`.
  * for simple batch normalization pass `axes=[0]` (batch only).

| Args  
---  
`x` |  A `Tensor`.   
`axes` |  Array of ints. Axes along which to compute mean and variance.   
`shift` |  Not used in the current implementation.   
`keepdims` |  produce moments with the same dimensionality as the input.   
`name` |  Name used to scope the operations that compute the moments.   
Returns  
---  
Two `Tensor` objects: `mean` and `variance`.
