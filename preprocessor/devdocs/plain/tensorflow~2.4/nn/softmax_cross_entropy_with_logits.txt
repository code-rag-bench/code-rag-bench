# tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits

View source on GitHub  Computes softmax cross entropy between `logits` and
`labels`.

    
    tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(
        labels, logits, axis=-1, name=None
    )
    
Measures the probability error in discrete classification tasks in which the
classes are mutually exclusive (each entry is in exactly one class). For
example, each CIFAR-10 image is labeled with one and only one label: an image
can be a dog or a truck, but not both.

> Note: While the classes are mutually exclusive, their probabilities need not
> be. All that is required is that each row of `labels` is a valid probability
> distribution. If they are not, the computation of the gradient will be
> incorrect.
If using exclusive `labels` (wherein one and only one class is true at a
time), see `sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`.

#### Usage:

    
    logits = [[4.0, 2.0, 1.0], [0.0, 5.0, 1.0]]
    labels = [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.8, 0.2]]
    tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=labels, logits=logits)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2,), dtype=float32,
    numpy=array([0.16984604, 0.82474494], dtype=float32)>
    
Warning: This op expects unscaled logits, since it performs a `softmax` on `logits` internally for efficiency. Do not call this op with the output of `softmax`, as it will produce incorrect results. A common use case is to have logits and labels of shape `[batch_size, num_classes]`, but higher dimensions are supported, with the `axis` argument specifying the class dimension. `logits` and `labels` must have the same dtype (either `float16`, `float32`, or `float64`). Backpropagation will happen into both `logits` and `labels`. To disallow backpropagation into `labels`, pass label tensors through `tf.stop_gradient` before feeding it to this function. Note that to avoid confusion, it is required to pass only named arguments to this function. | Args  
---  
`labels` |  Each vector along the class dimension should hold a valid probability distribution e.g. for the case in which labels are of shape `[batch_size, num_classes]`, each row of `labels[i]` must be a valid probability distribution.   
`logits` |  Per-label activations, typically a linear output. These activation energies are interpreted as unnormalized log probabilities.   
`axis` |  The class dimension. Defaulted to -1 which is the last dimension.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` that contains the softmax cross entropy loss. Its type is the same
as `logits` and its shape is the same as `labels` except that it does not have
the last dimension of `labels`.
