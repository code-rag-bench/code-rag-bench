    tf.nn.log_poisson_loss(
        targets, log_input, compute_full_loss=False, name=None
    )
    
Gives the log-likelihood loss between the prediction and the target under the
assumption that the target has a Poisson distribution. Caveat: By default,
this is not the exact loss, but the loss minus a constant term [log(z!)]. That
has no effect for optimization, but does not play well with relative loss
comparisons. To compute an approximation of the log factorial term, specify
compute_full_loss=True to enable Stirling's Approximation. For brevity, let `c
= log(x) = log_input`, `z = targets`. The log Poisson loss is

    
      -log(exp(-x) * (x^z) / z!)
    = -log(exp(-x) * (x^z)) + log(z!)
    ~ -log(exp(-x)) - log(x^z) [+ z * log(z) - z + 0.5 * log(2 * pi * z)]
        [ Note the second term is the Stirling's Approximation for log(z!).
          It is invariant to x and does not affect optimization, though
          important for correct relative loss comparisons. It is only
          computed when compute_full_loss == True. ]
    = x - z * log(x) [+ z * log(z) - z + 0.5 * log(2 * pi * z)]
    = exp(c) - z * c [+ z * log(z) - z + 0.5 * log(2 * pi * z)]
    
| Args  
---  
`targets` |  A `Tensor` of the same type and shape as `log_input`.   
`log_input` |  A `Tensor` of type `float32` or `float64`.   
`compute_full_loss` |  whether to compute the full loss. If false, a constant term is dropped in favor of more efficient optimization.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of the same shape as `log_input` with the componentwise logistic
losses.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `log_input` and `targets` do not have the same shape.
