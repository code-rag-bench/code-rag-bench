# Module: tf.distribute.cluster_resolver

Library imports for ClusterResolvers.

This library contains all implementations of ClusterResolvers.
ClusterResolvers are a way of specifying cluster information for distributed
execution. Built on top of existing `ClusterSpec` framework, ClusterResolvers
are a way for TensorFlow to communicate with various cluster management
systems (e.g. GCE, AWS, etc...).
