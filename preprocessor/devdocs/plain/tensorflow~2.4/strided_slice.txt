    tf.strided_slice(
        input_, begin, end, strides=None, begin_mask=0, end_mask=0, ellipsis_mask=0,
        new_axis_mask=0, shrink_axis_mask=0, var=None, name=None
    )
    
See also `tf.slice`. Instead of calling this op directly most users will want
to use the NumPy-style slicing syntax (e.g. `tensor[..., 3:4:-1, tf.newaxis,
3]`), which is supported via `tf.Tensor.getitem` and `tf.Variable.getitem`.
The interface of this op is a low-level encoding of the slicing syntax.
Roughly speaking, this op extracts a slice of size `(end-begin)/stride` from
the given `input_` tensor. Starting at the location specified by `begin` the
slice continues by adding `stride` to the index until all dimensions are not
less than `end`. Note that a stride can be negative, which causes a reverse
slice. Given a Python slice `input[spec0, spec1, ..., specn]`, this function
will be called as follows. `begin`, `end`, and `strides` will be vectors of
length n. n in general is not equal to the rank of the `input_` tensor. In
each mask field (`begin_mask`, `end_mask`, `ellipsis_mask`, `new_axis_mask`,
`shrink_axis_mask`) the ith bit will correspond to the ith spec. If the ith
bit of `begin_mask` is set, `begin[i]` is ignored and the fullest possible
range in that dimension is used instead. `end_mask` works analogously, except
with the end range. `foo[5:,:,:3]` on a 7x8x9 tensor is equivalent to
`foo[5:7,0:8,0:3]`. `foo[::-1]` reverses a tensor with shape 8. If the ith bit
of `ellipsis_mask` is set, as many unspecified dimensions as needed will be
inserted between other dimensions. Only one non-zero bit is allowed in
`ellipsis_mask`. For example `foo[3:5,...,4:5]` on a shape 10x3x3x10 tensor is
equivalent to `foo[3:5,:,:,4:5]` and `foo[3:5,...]` is equivalent to
`foo[3:5,:,:,:]`. If the ith bit of `new_axis_mask` is set, then `begin`,
`end`, and `stride` are ignored and a new length 1 dimension is added at this
point in the output tensor. For example, `foo[:4, tf.newaxis, :2]` would
produce a shape `(4, 1, 2)` tensor. If the ith bit of `shrink_axis_mask` is
set, it implies that the ith specification shrinks the dimensionality by 1,
taking on the value at index `begin[i]`. `end[i]` and `strides[i]` are ignored
in this case. For example in Python one might do `foo[:, 3, :]` which would
result in `shrink_axis_mask` equal to 2.

> Note: `begin` and `end` are zero-indexed. `strides` entries must be non-
> zero.
