`tf.compat.v1.train.ExponentialMovingAverage`

    
    tf.train.ExponentialMovingAverage(
        decay, num_updates=None, zero_debias=False,
        name='ExponentialMovingAverage'
    )
    
When training a model, it is often beneficial to maintain moving averages of
the trained parameters. Evaluations that use averaged parameters sometimes
produce significantly better results than the final trained values. The
`apply()` method adds shadow copies of trained variables and add ops that
maintain a moving average of the trained variables in their shadow copies. It
is used when building the training model. The ops that maintain moving
averages are typically run after each training step. The `average()` and
`average_name()` methods give access to the shadow variables and their names.
They are useful when building an evaluation model, or when restoring a model
from a checkpoint file. They help use the moving averages in place of the last
trained values for evaluations. The moving averages are computed using
exponential decay. You specify the decay value when creating the
`ExponentialMovingAverage` object. The shadow variables are initialized with
the same initial values as the trained variables. When you run the ops to
maintain the moving averages, each shadow variable is updated with the
formula: `shadow_variable -= (1 - decay) * (shadow_variable - variable)` This
is mathematically equivalent to the classic formula below, but the use of an
`assign_sub` op (the `"-="` in the formula) allows concurrent lockless updates
to the variables: `shadow_variable = decay * shadow_variable + (1 - decay) *
variable` Reasonable values for `decay` are close to 1.0, typically in the
multiple-nines range: 0.999, 0.9999, etc. Example usage when creating a
training model:

    
    # Create variables.
    var0 = tf.Variable(...)
    var1 = tf.Variable(...)
    # ... use the variables to build a training model...
    ...
    # Create an op that applies the optimizer.  This is what we usually
    # would use as a training op.
    opt_op = opt.minimize(my_loss, [var0, var1])
    
    # Create an ExponentialMovingAverage object
    ema = tf.train.ExponentialMovingAverage(decay=0.9999)
    
    with tf.control_dependencies([opt_op]):
        # Create the shadow variables, and add ops to maintain moving averages
        # of var0 and var1. This also creates an op that will update the moving
        # averages after each training step.  This is what we will use in place
        # of the usual training op.
        training_op = ema.apply([var0, var1])
    
    ...train the model by running training_op...
    
There are two ways to use the moving averages for evaluations:

  * Build a model that uses the shadow variables instead of the variables. For this, use the `average()` method which returns the shadow variable for a given variable.
  * Build a model normally but load the checkpoint files to evaluate by using the shadow variable names. For this use the `average_name()` method. See the `tf.compat.v1.train.Saver` for more information on restoring saved variables.

Example of restoring the shadow variable values:

    
    # Create a Saver that loads variables from their saved shadow values.
    shadow_var0_name = ema.average_name(var0)
    shadow_var1_name = ema.average_name(var1)
    saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver({shadow_var0_name: var0, shadow_var1_name:
    var1})
    saver.restore(...checkpoint filename...)
    # var0 and var1 now hold the moving average values

## Methods

### `apply`

View source

    
    apply(
        var_list=None
    )
    
Maintains moving averages of variables.

`var_list` must be a list of `Variable` or `Tensor` objects. This method
creates shadow variables for all elements of `var_list`. Shadow variables for
`Variable` objects are initialized to the variable's initial value. They will
be added to the `GraphKeys.MOVING_AVERAGE_VARIABLES` collection. For `Tensor`
objects, the shadow variables are initialized to 0 and zero debiased (see
docstring in `assign_moving_average` for more details).

shadow variables are created with `trainable=False` and added to the
`GraphKeys.ALL_VARIABLES` collection. They will be returned by calls to
`tf.compat.v1.global_variables()`.

Returns an op that updates all shadow variables from the current value of
their associated variables.

Note that `apply()` can be called multiple times. When eager execution is
enabled each call to apply will update the variables once, so this needs to be
called in a loop.

Args  
---  
`var_list` |  A list of Variable or Tensor objects. The variables and Tensors must be of types bfloat16, float16, float32, or float64.   
Returns  
---  
An Operation that updates the moving averages.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If the arguments are not an allowed type.   
### `average`

View source

    
    average(
        var
    )
    
Returns the `Variable` holding the average of `var`.

Args  
---  
`var` |  A `Variable` object.   
Returns  
---  
A `Variable` object or `None` if the moving average of `var` is not
maintained.  
### `average_name`

View source

    
    average_name(
        var
    )
    
Returns the name of the `Variable` holding the average for `var`.

The typical scenario for `ExponentialMovingAverage` is to compute moving
averages of variables during training, and restore the variables from the
computed moving averages during evaluations.

To restore variables, you have to know the name of the shadow variables. That
name and the original variable can then be passed to a `Saver()` object to
restore the variable from the moving average value with: `saver =
tf.compat.v1.train.Saver({ema.average_name(var): var})`

`average_name()` can be called whether or not `apply()` has been called.

Args  
---  
`var` |  A `Variable` object.   
Returns  
---  
A string: The name of the variable that will be used or was used by the
`ExponentialMovingAverage class` to hold the moving average of `var`.  
### `variables_to_restore`

View source

    
    variables_to_restore(
        moving_avg_variables=None
    )
    
Returns a map of names to `Variables` to restore.

If a variable has a moving average, use the moving average variable name as
the restore name; otherwise, use the variable name.

For example,

    
    variables_to_restore = ema.variables_to_restore()
    saver = tf.compat.v1.train.Saver(variables_to_restore)
    
Below is an example of such mapping:

    
    conv/batchnorm/gamma/ExponentialMovingAverage: conv/batchnorm/gamma,
    conv_4/conv2d_params/ExponentialMovingAverage: conv_4/conv2d_params,
    global_step: global_step
    
Args  
---  
`moving_avg_variables` |  a list of variables that require to use of the moving average variable name to be restored. If None, it will default to variables.moving_average_variables() + variables.trainable_variables()   
Returns  
---  
A map from restore_names to variables. The restore_name is either the original
or the moving average version of the variable name, depending on whether the
variable name is in the `moving_avg_variables`.
