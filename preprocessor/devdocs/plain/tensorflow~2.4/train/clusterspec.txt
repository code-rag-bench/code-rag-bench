# tf.train.ClusterSpec

View source on GitHub  Represents a cluster as a set of "tasks", organized
into "jobs".

`tf.compat.v1.train.ClusterSpec`

    
    tf.train.ClusterSpec(
        cluster
    )
    
A `tf.train.ClusterSpec` represents the set of processes that participate in a
distributed TensorFlow computation. Every `tf.distribute.Server` is
constructed in a particular cluster. To create a cluster with two jobs and
five tasks, you specify the mapping from job names to lists of network
addresses (typically hostname-port pairs).

    
    cluster = tf.train.ClusterSpec({"worker": ["worker0.example.com:2222",
                                               "worker1.example.com:2222",
                                               "worker2.example.com:2222"],
                                    "ps": ["ps0.example.com:2222",
                                           "ps1.example.com:2222"]})
    
Each job may also be specified as a sparse mapping from task indices to
network addresses. This enables a server to be configured without needing to
know the identity of (for example) all other worker tasks:

    
    cluster = tf.train.ClusterSpec({"worker": {1: "worker1.example.com:2222"},
                                    "ps": ["ps0.example.com:2222",
                                           "ps1.example.com:2222"]})
    
| Args  
---  
`cluster` |  A dictionary mapping one or more job names to (i) a list of network addresses, or (ii) a dictionary mapping integer task indices to network addresses; or a `tf.train.ClusterDef` protocol buffer.   
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If `cluster` is not a dictionary mapping strings to lists of strings, and not a `tf.train.ClusterDef` protobuf.   
Attributes  
---  
`jobs` |  Returns a list of job names in this cluster.   
## Methods

### `as_cluster_def`

View source

    
    as_cluster_def()
    
Returns a `tf.train.ClusterDef` protocol buffer based on this cluster.

### `as_dict`

View source

    
    as_dict()
    
Returns a dictionary from job names to their tasks.

For each job, if the task index space is dense, the corresponding value will
be a list of network addresses; otherwise it will be a dictionary mapping
(sparse) task indices to the corresponding addresses.

Returns  
---  
A dictionary mapping job names to lists or dictionaries describing the tasks
in those jobs.  
### `job_tasks`

View source

    
    job_tasks(
        job_name
    )
    
Returns a mapping from task ID to address in the given job.

> Note: For backwards compatibility, this method returns a list. If the given
> job was defined with a sparse set of task indices, the length of this list
> may not reflect the number of tasks defined in this job. Use the
> `tf.train.ClusterSpec.num_tasks` method to find the number of tasks defined
> in a particular job.
Args  
---  
`job_name` |  The string name of a job in this cluster.   
Returns  
---  
A list of task addresses, where the index in the list corresponds to the task
index of each task. The list may contain `None` if the job was defined with a
sparse set of task indices.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `job_name` does not name a job in this cluster.   
### `num_tasks`

View source

    
    num_tasks(
        job_name
    )
    
Returns the number of tasks defined in the given job.

Args  
---  
`job_name` |  The string name of a job in this cluster.   
Returns  
---  
The number of tasks defined in the given job.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `job_name` does not name a job in this cluster.   
### `task_address`

View source

    
    task_address(
        job_name, task_index
    )
    
Returns the address of the given task in the given job.

Args  
---  
`job_name` |  The string name of a job in this cluster.   
`task_index` |  A non-negative integer.   
Returns  
---  
The address of the given task in the given job.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `job_name` does not name a job in this cluster, or no task with index `task_index` is defined in that job.   
### `task_indices`

View source

    
    task_indices(
        job_name
    )
    
Returns a list of valid task indices in the given job.

Args  
---  
`job_name` |  The string name of a job in this cluster.   
Returns  
---  
A list of valid task indices in the given job.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `job_name` does not name a job in this cluster, or no task with index `task_index` is defined in that job.   
### `__bool__`

View source

    
    __bool__()
    
### `__eq__`

View source

    
    __eq__(
        other
    )
    
Return self==value.

### `__ne__`

View source

    
    __ne__(
        other
    )
    
Return self!=value.
