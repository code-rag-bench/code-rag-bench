    tf.grad_pass_through(
        f
    )
    
Use this function to wrap any op, maintaining its behavior in the forward
pass, but replacing the original op in the backward graph with an identity.
For example:

    
    x = tf.Variable(1.0, name="x")
    z = tf.Variable(3.0, name="z")
    
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
      # y will evaluate to 9.0
      y = tf.grad_pass_through(x.assign)(z**2)
    # grads will evaluate to 6.0
    grads = tape.gradient(y, z)
    
Another example is a 'differentiable' moving average approximation, where
gradients are allowed to flow into the last value fed to the moving average,
but the moving average is still used for the forward pass:

    
    x = ... # Some scalar value
    # A moving average object, we don't need to know how this is implemented
    moving_average = MovingAverage()
    with backprop.GradientTape() as tape:
      # mavg_x will evaluate to the current running average value
      mavg_x = tf.grad_pass_through(moving_average)(x)
    grads = tape.gradient(mavg_x, x) # grads will evaluate to 1.0
    
| Args  
---  
`f` |  function `f(*x)` that returns a `Tensor` or nested structure of `Tensor` outputs.   
Returns  
---  
A function `h(x)` which returns the same values as `f(x)` and whose gradients
are the same as those of an identity function.
