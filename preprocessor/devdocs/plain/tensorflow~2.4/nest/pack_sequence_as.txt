`tf.compat.v1.nest.pack_sequence_as`

    
    tf.nest.pack_sequence_as(
        structure, flat_sequence, expand_composites=False
    )
    
If `structure` is a scalar, `flat_sequence` must be a single-element list; in this case the return value is `flat_sequence[0]`. If `structure` is or contains a dict instance, the keys will be sorted to pack the flat sequence in deterministic order. This is true also for `OrderedDict` instances: their sequence order is ignored, the sorting order of keys is used instead. The same convention is followed in `flatten`. This correctly repacks dicts and `OrderedDict`s after they have been flattened, and also allows flattening an `OrderedDict` and then repacking it back using a corresponding plain dict, or vice-versa. Dictionaries with non-sortable keys cannot be flattened. | Args  
---  
`structure` |  Nested structure, whose structure is given by nested lists, tuples, and dicts. Note: numpy arrays and strings are considered scalars.   
`flat_sequence` |  flat sequence to pack.   
`expand_composites` |  If true, then composite tensors such as `tf.sparse.SparseTensor` and `tf.RaggedTensor` are expanded into their component tensors.   
Returns  
---  
`packed` |  `flat_sequence` converted to have the same recursive structure as `structure`.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `flat_sequence` and `structure` have different element counts.   
`TypeError` |  `structure` is or contains a dict with non-sortable keys.
