    )
    
## Child Classes

`class failureException`

## Methods

### `addCleanup`

    
    addCleanup(
        *args, **kwargs
    )
    
Add a function, with arguments, to be called when the test is completed.
Functions added are called on a LIFO basis and are called after tearDown on
test failure or success. Cleanup items are called even if setUp fails (unlike
tearDown).

### `addTypeEqualityFunc`

    
    addTypeEqualityFunc(
        typeobj, function
    )
    
Add a type specific assertEqual style function to compare a type. This method is for use by TestCase subclasses that need to register their own type equality functions to provide nicer error messages. | Args  
---  
`typeobj` |  The data type to call this function on when both values are of the same type in assertEqual().   
`function` |  The callable taking two arguments and an optional msg= argument that raises self.failureException with a useful error message when the two arguments are not equal.   
### `assertAllClose`

View source

    
    assertAllClose(
        a, b, rtol=1e-06, atol=1e-06, msg=None
    )
    
Asserts that two structures of numpy arrays or Tensors, have near values.

`a` and `b` can be arbitrarily nested structures. A layer of a nested
structure can be a `dict`, `namedtuple`, `tuple` or `list`.

> Note: the implementation follows `numpy.allclose` (and
> numpy.testing.assert_allclose). It checks whether two arrays are element-
> wise equal within a tolerance. The relative difference (`rtol * abs(b)`) and
> the absolute difference `atol` are added together to compare against the
> absolute difference between `a` and `b`.
Args  
---  
`a` |  The expected numpy `ndarray`, or anything that can be converted into a numpy `ndarray` (including Tensor), or any arbitrarily nested of structure of these.   
`b` |  The actual numpy `ndarray`, or anything that can be converted into a numpy `ndarray` (including Tensor), or any arbitrarily nested of structure of these.   
`rtol` |  relative tolerance.   
`atol` |  absolute tolerance.   
`msg` |  Optional message to report on failure.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if only one of `a[p]` and `b[p]` is a dict or `a[p]` and `b[p]` have different length, where `[p]` denotes a path to the nested structure, e.g. given `a = [(1, 1), {'d': (6, 7)}]` and `[p] = [1]['d']`, then `a[p] = (6, 7)`.

### `assertNotStartsWith`

    
    assertNotStartsWith(
        actual, unexpected_start, msg=None
    )
    
Asserts that actual.startswith(unexpected_start) is False.

Args  
---  
`actual` |  str   
`unexpected_start` |  str   
`msg` |  Optional message to report on failure.   
### `assertProtoEquals`

View source

    
    assertProtoEquals(
        expected_message_maybe_ascii, message, msg=None
    )
    
Asserts that message is same as parsed expected_message_ascii.

Creates another prototype of message, reads the ascii message into it and then
compares them using self._AssertProtoEqual().

Args  
---  
`expected_message_maybe_ascii` |  proto message in original or ascii form.   
`message` |  the message to validate.   
`msg` |  Optional message to report on failure.   
### `assertProtoEqualsVersion`

View source

    
    assertProtoEqualsVersion(
        expected, actual, producer=versions.GRAPH_DEF_VERSION,
        min_consumer=versions.GRAPH_DEF_VERSION_MIN_CONSUMER, msg=None
    )
    
### `assertRaises`

    
    assertRaises(
        expected_exception, *args, **kwargs
    )
    
Fail unless an exception of class expected_exception is raised by the callable
when invoked with specified positional and keyword arguments. If a different
type of exception is raised, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an unexpected exception.

If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a context
object used like this::

    
    with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
        do_something()
    
An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertRaises is used
as a context object.

The context manager keeps a reference to the exception as the 'exception'
attribute. This allows you to inspect the exception after the assertion::

    
    with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
        do_something()
    the_exception = cm.exception
    self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)
    
### `assertRaisesOpError`

View source

    
    assertRaisesOpError(
        expected_err_re_or_predicate
    )
    
### `assertRaisesRegex`

    
    assertRaisesRegex(
        expected_exception, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs
    )
    
Asserts that the message in a raised exception matches a regex.

Args  
---  
`expected_exception` |  Exception class expected to be raised.   
`expected_regex` |  Regex (re.Pattern object or string) expected to be found in error message.   
`args` |  Function to be called and extra positional args.   
`kwargs` |  Extra kwargs.   
`msg` |  Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used when assertRaisesRegex is used as a context manager.   
### `assertRaisesRegexp`

    
    assertRaisesRegexp(
        expected_exception, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs
    )
    
Asserts that the message in a raised exception matches a regex.

Args  
---  
`expected_exception` |  Exception class expected to be raised.   
`expected_regex` |  Regex (re.Pattern object or string) expected to be found in error message.   
`args` |  Function to be called and extra positional args.   
`kwargs` |  Extra kwargs.   
`msg` |  Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used when assertRaisesRegex is used as a context manager.   
### `assertRaisesWithLiteralMatch`

    
    assertRaisesWithLiteralMatch(
        expected_exception, expected_exception_message, callable_obj=None, *args,
        **kwargs
    )
    
Asserts that the message in a raised exception equals the given string.

Unlike assertRaisesRegex, this method takes a literal string, not a regular
expression.

with self.assertRaisesWithLiteralMatch(ExType, 'message'): DoSomething()

Args  
---  
`expected_exception` |  Exception class expected to be raised.   
`expected_exception_message` |  String message expected in the raised exception. For a raise exception e, expected_exception_message must equal str(e).   
`callable_obj` |  Function to be called, or None to return a context.   
`*args` |  Extra args.   
`**kwargs` |  Extra kwargs.   
Returns  
---  
A context manager if callable_obj is None. Otherwise, None.  
Raises  
---  
self.failureException if callable_obj does not raise a matching exception.  
### `assertRaisesWithPredicateMatch`

View source

    
    @contextlib.contextmanager
    assertRaisesWithPredicateMatch(
        exception_type, expected_err_re_or_predicate
    )
    
Returns a context manager to enclose code expected to raise an exception.

If the exception is an OpError, the op stack is also included in the message
predicate search.

Args  
---  
`exception_type` |  The expected type of exception that should be raised.   
`expected_err_re_or_predicate` |  If this is callable, it should be a function of one argument that inspects the passed-in exception and returns True (success) or False (please fail the test). Otherwise, the error message is expected to match this regular expression partially.   
Returns  
---  
A context manager to surround code that is expected to raise an exception.  
### `assertRegex`

    
    assertRegex(
        text, expected_regex, msg=None
    )
    
Fail the test unless the text matches the regular expression.

### `assertRegexMatch`

    
    assertRegexMatch(
        actual_str, regexes, message=None
    )
    
Asserts that at least one regex in regexes matches str.

If possible you should use `assertRegex`, which is a simpler version of this
method. `assertRegex` takes a single regular expression (a string or re
compiled object) instead of a list.

#### Notes:

  1. This function uses substring matching, i.e. the matching succeeds if any substring of the error message matches any regex in the list. This is more convenient for the user than full-string matching.
  2. If regexes is the empty list, the matching will always fail.
  3. Use regexes=[''] for a regex that will always pass.
  4. '.' matches any single character except the newline. To match any character, use '(.|\n)'.
  5. '^' matches the beginning of each line, not just the beginning of the string. Similarly, '$' matches the end of each line.
  6. An exception will be thrown if regexes contains an invalid regex.

Args  
---  
`actual_str` |  The string we try to match with the items in regexes.   
`regexes` |  The regular expressions we want to match against str. See "Notes" above for detailed notes on how this is interpreted.   
`message` |  The message to be printed if the test fails.   
### `assertRegexpMatches`

    
    assertRegexpMatches(
        *args, **kwargs
    )
    
### `assertSameElements`

    
    assertSameElements(
        expected_seq, actual_seq, msg=None
    )
    
Asserts that two sequences have the same elements (in any order).

This method, unlike assertCountEqual, doesn't care about any duplicates in the
expected and actual sequences.

> assertSameElements([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1]) # Doesn't raise an
> AssertionError
If possible, you should use assertCountEqual instead of assertSameElements.

Args  
---  
`expected_seq` |  A sequence containing elements we are expecting.   
`actual_seq` |  The sequence that we are testing.   
`msg` |  The message to be printed if the test fails.   
### `assertSameStructure`

    
    assertSameStructure(
        a, b, aname='a', bname='b', msg=None
    )
    
Asserts that two values contain the same structural content.

The two arguments should be data trees consisting of trees of dicts and lists.
They will be deeply compared by walking into the contents of dicts and lists;
other items will be compared using the == operator. If the two structures
differ in content, the failure message will indicate the location within the
structures where the first difference is found. This may be helpful when
comparing large structures.

Mixed Sequence and Set types are supported. Mixed Mapping types are supported,
but the order of the keys will not be considered in the comparison.

Args  
---  
`a` |  The first structure to compare.   
`b` |  The second structure to compare.   
`aname` |  Variable name to use for the first structure in assertion messages.   
`bname` |  Variable name to use for the second structure.   
`msg` |  Additional text to include in the failure message.   
### `assertSequenceAlmostEqual`

    
    assertSequenceAlmostEqual(
        expected_seq, actual_seq, places=None, msg=None, delta=None
    )
    
An approximate equality assertion for ordered sequences.

Fail if the two sequences are unequal as determined by their value differences
rounded to the given number of decimal places (default 7) and comparing to
zero, or by comparing that the difference between each value in the two
sequences is more than the given delta.

Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same as significant
digits (measured from the most significant digit).

If the two sequences compare equal then they will automatically compare almost
equal.

Args  
---  
`expected_seq` |  A sequence containing elements we are expecting.   
`actual_seq` |  The sequence that we are testing.   
`places` |  The number of decimal places to compare.   
`msg` |  The message to be printed if the test fails.   
`delta` |  The OK difference between compared values.   
### `assertSequenceEqual`

    
    assertSequenceEqual(
        seq1, seq2, msg=None, seq_type=None
    )
    
An equality assertion for ordered sequences (like lists and tuples).

For the purposes of this function, a valid ordered sequence type is one which
can be indexed, has a length, and has an equality operator.

Args  
---  
`seq1` |  The first sequence to compare.   
`seq2` |  The second sequence to compare.   
`seq_type` |  The expected datatype of the sequences, or None if no datatype should be enforced.   
`msg` |  Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of differences.   
### `assertSequenceStartsWith`

    
    assertSequenceStartsWith(
        prefix, whole, msg=None
    )
    
An equality assertion for the beginning of ordered sequences.

If prefix is an empty sequence, it will raise an error unless whole is also an
empty sequence.

If prefix is not a sequence, it will raise an error if the first element of
whole does not match.

Args  
---  
`prefix` |  A sequence expected at the beginning of the whole parameter.   
`whole` |  The sequence in which to look for prefix.   
`msg` |  Optional message to report on failure.   
### `assertSetEqual`

    
    assertSetEqual(
        set1, set2, msg=None
    )
    
A set-specific equality assertion.

Args  
---  
`set1` |  The first set to compare.   
`set2` |  The second set to compare.   
`msg` |  Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of differences.   
assertSetEqual uses ducktyping to support different types of sets, and is
optimized for sets specifically (parameters must support a difference method).

### `assertShapeEqual`

View source

    
    assertShapeEqual(
        np_array, tf_tensor, msg=None
    )
    
Asserts that a Numpy ndarray and a TensorFlow tensor have the same shape.

Args  
---  
`np_array` |  A Numpy ndarray or Numpy scalar.   
`tf_tensor` |  A Tensor.   
`msg` |  Optional message to report on failure.   
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  If the arguments have the wrong type.   
### `assertStartsWith`

View source

    
    assertStartsWith(
        actual, expected_start, msg=None
    )
    
Assert that actual.startswith(expected_start) is True.

Args  
---  
`actual` |  str   
`expected_start` |  str   
`msg` |  Optional message to report on failure.   
### `assertTotallyOrdered`

    
    assertTotallyOrdered(
        *groups, **kwargs
    )
    
Asserts that total ordering has been implemented correctly.

For example, say you have a class A that compares only on its attribute x.
Comparators other than lt are omitted for brevity.

class A(object): def init(self, x, y): self.x = x self.y = y

def hash(self): return hash(self.x)

def lt(self, other): try: return self.x < other.x except AttributeError:
return NotImplemented

assertTotallyOrdered will check that instances can be ordered correctly. For
example,

self.assertTotallyOrdered( [None], # None should come before everything else.
[1], # Integers sort earlier. [A(1, 'a')], [A(2, 'b')], # 2 is after 1. [A(3,
'c'), A(3, 'd')], # The second argument is irrelevant. [A(4, 'z')], ['foo']) #
Strings sort last.

Args  
---  
`*groups` |  A list of groups of elements. Each group of elements is a list of objects that are equal. The elements in each group must be less than the elements in the group after it. For example, these groups are totally ordered: [None], [1], [2, 2], [3]. **kwargs: optional msg keyword argument can be passed.   
### `assertTrue`

    
    assertTrue(
        expr, msg=None
    )
    
Check that the expression is true.

### `assertTupleEqual`

    
    assertTupleEqual(
        tuple1, tuple2, msg=None
    )
    
A tuple-specific equality assertion.

Args  
---  
`tuple1` |  The first tuple to compare.   
`tuple2` |  The second tuple to compare.   
`msg` |  Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of differences.   
### `assertUrlEqual`

    
    assertUrlEqual(
        a, b, msg=None
    )
    
Asserts that urls are equal, ignoring ordering of query params.

### `assertWarns`

    
    assertWarns(
        expected_warning, *args, **kwargs
    )
    
Fail unless a warning of class warnClass is triggered by the callable when
invoked with specified positional and keyword arguments. If a different type
of warning is triggered, it will not be handled: depending on the other
warning filtering rules in effect, it might be silenced, printed out, or
raised as an exception.

If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a context
object used like this::

    
    with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
        do_something()
    
An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertWarns is used as
a context object.

The context manager keeps a reference to the first matching warning as the
'warning' attribute; similarly, the 'filename' and 'lineno' attributes give
you information about the line of Python code from which the warning was
triggered. This allows you to inspect the warning after the assertion::

    
    with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
        do_something()
    the_warning = cm.warning
    self.assertEqual(the_warning.some_attribute, 147)
    
### `assertWarnsRegex`

    
    assertWarnsRegex(
        expected_warning, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs
    )
    
Asserts that the message in a triggered warning matches a regexp. Basic
functioning is similar to assertWarns() with the addition that only warnings
whose messages also match the regular expression are considered successful
matches.

Args  
---  
`expected_warning` |  Warning class expected to be triggered.   
`expected_regex` |  Regex (re.Pattern object or string) expected to be found in error message.   
`args` |  Function to be called and extra positional args.   
`kwargs` |  Extra kwargs.   
`msg` |  Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used when assertWarnsRegex is used as a context manager.   
### `assert_`

    
    assert_(
        *args, **kwargs
    )
    
### `cached_session`

View source

    
    @contextlib.contextmanager
    cached_session(
        graph=None, config=None, use_gpu=False, force_gpu=False
    )
    
Returns a TensorFlow Session for use in executing tests.

This method behaves differently than self.session(): for performance reasons
`cached_session` will by default reuse the same session within the same test.
The session returned by this function will only be closed at the end of the
test (in the TearDown function).

Use the `use_gpu` and `force_gpu` options to control where ops are run. If
`force_gpu` is True, all ops are pinned to `/device:GPU:0`. Otherwise, if
`use_gpu` is True, TensorFlow tries to run as many ops on the GPU as possible.
If both `force_gpu and`use_gpu` are False, all ops are pinned to the CPU.

#### Example:

    
    class MyOperatorTest(test_util.TensorFlowTestCase):
      def testMyOperator(self):
        with self.cached_session(use_gpu=True) as sess:
          valid_input = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
          result = MyOperator(valid_input).eval()
          self.assertEqual(result, [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 8.0]
          invalid_input = [-1.0, 2.0, 7.0]
          with self.assertRaisesOpError("negative input not supported"):
            MyOperator(invalid_input).eval()
    
Args  
---  
`graph` |  Optional graph to use during the returned session.   
`config` |  An optional config_pb2.ConfigProto to use to configure the session.   
`use_gpu` |  If True, attempt to run as many ops as possible on GPU.   
`force_gpu` |  If True, pin all ops to `/device:GPU:0`.   
Yields  
---  
A Session object that should be used as a context manager to surround the
graph building and execution code in a test case.  
### `captureWritesToStream`

View source

    
    @contextlib.contextmanager
    captureWritesToStream(
        stream
    )
    
A context manager that captures the writes to a given stream.

This context manager captures all writes to a given stream inside of a
`CapturedWrites` object. When this context manager is created, it yields the
`CapturedWrites` object. The captured contents can be accessed by calling
`.contents()` on the `CapturedWrites`.

For this function to work, the stream must have a file descriptor that can be
modified using `os.dup` and `os.dup2`, and the stream must support a
`.flush()` method. The default python sys.stdout and sys.stderr are examples
of this. Note that this does not work in Colab or Jupyter notebooks, because
those use alternate stdout streams.

#### Example:

    
    class MyOperatorTest(test_util.TensorFlowTestCase):
      def testMyOperator(self):
        input = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
        with self.captureWritesToStream(sys.stdout) as captured:
          result = MyOperator(input).eval()
        self.assertStartsWith(captured.contents(), "This was printed.")
    
Args  
---  
`stream` |  The stream whose writes should be captured. This stream must have a file descriptor, support writing via using that file descriptor, and must have a `.flush()` method.   
Yields  
---  
A `CapturedWrites` object that contains all writes to the specified stream
made during this context.  
### `checkedThread`

View source

    
    checkedThread(
        target, args=None, kwargs=None
    )
    
Returns a Thread wrapper that asserts 'target' completes successfully.

This method should be used to create all threads in test cases, as otherwise
there is a risk that a thread will silently fail, and/or assertions made in
the thread will not be respected.

Args  
---  
`target` |  A callable object to be executed in the thread.   
`args` |  The argument tuple for the target invocation. Defaults to ().   
`kwargs` |  A dictionary of keyword arguments for the target invocation. Defaults to {}.   
Returns  
---  
A wrapper for threading.Thread that supports start() and join() methods.  
### `countTestCases`

    
    countTestCases()
    
### `create_tempdir`

    
    create_tempdir(
        name=None, cleanup=None
    )
    
Create a temporary directory specific to the test.

> Note: The directory and its contents will be recursively cleared before
> creation. This ensures that there is no pre-existing state.
This creates a named directory on disk that is isolated to this test, and will
be properly cleaned up by the test. This avoids several pitfalls of creating
temporary directories for test purposes, as well as makes it easier to setup
directories and verify their contents. For example:

    
    def test_foo(self):
      out_dir = self.create_tempdir()
      out_log = out_dir.create_file('output.log')
      expected_outputs = [
          os.path.join(out_dir, 'data-0.txt'),
          os.path.join(out_dir, 'data-1.txt'),
      ]
      code_under_test(out_dir)
      self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(expected_paths[0]))
      self.assertTrue(os.path.exists(expected_paths[1]))
      self.assertEqual('foo', out_log.read_text())
    
See also: `create_tempfile()` for creating temporary files.

Args  
---  
`name` |  Optional name of the directory. If not given, a unique name will be generated and used.   
`cleanup` |  Optional cleanup policy on when/if to remove the directory (and all its contents) at the end of the test. If None, then uses `self.tempfile_cleanup`.   
Returns  
---  
A _TempDir representing the created directory; see _TempDir class docs for
usage.  
### `create_tempfile`

    
    create_tempfile(
        file_path=None, content=None, mode='w', encoding='utf8',
        errors='strict', cleanup=None
    )
    
Create a temporary file specific to the test.

This creates a named file on disk that is isolated to this test, and will be
properly cleaned up by the test. This avoids several pitfalls of creating
temporary files for test purposes, as well as makes it easier to setup files,
their data, read them back, and inspect them when a test fails. For example:

    
    def test_foo(self):
      output = self.create_tempfile()
      code_under_test(output)
      self.assertGreater(os.path.getsize(output), 0)
      self.assertEqual('foo', output.read_text())
    
> Note: This will zero-out the file. This ensures there is no pre-existing
> state. NOTE: If the file already exists, it will be made writable and
> overwritten.
See also: `create_tempdir()` for creating temporary directories, and
`_TempDir.create_file` for creating files within a temporary directory.

Args  
---  
`file_path` |  Optional file path for the temp file. If not given, a unique file name will be generated and used. Slashes are allowed in the name; any missing intermediate directories will be created. NOTE: This path is the path that will be cleaned up, including any directories in the path, e.g., 'foo/bar/baz.txt' will `rm -r foo`.   
`content` |  Optional string or bytes to initially write to the file. If not specified, then an empty file is created.   
`mode` |  Mode string to use when writing content. Only used if `content` is non-empty.   
`encoding` |  Encoding to use when writing string content. Only used if `content` is text.   
`errors` |  How to handle text to bytes encoding errors. Only used if `content` is text.   
`cleanup` |  Optional cleanup policy on when/if to remove the directory (and all its contents) at the end of the test. If None, then uses `self.tempfile_cleanup`.   
Returns  
---  
A _TempFile representing the created file; see _TempFile class docs for usage.  
### `debug`

    
    debug()
    
Run the test without collecting errors in a TestResult

### `defaultTestResult`

    
    defaultTestResult()
    
### `doCleanups`

    
    doCleanups()
    
Execute all cleanup functions. Normally called for you after tearDown.

### `enter_context`

    
    enter_context(
        manager
    )
    
Returns the CM's value after registering it with the exit stack.

Entering a context pushes it onto a stack of contexts. The context is exited
when the test completes. Contexts are are exited in the reverse order of
entering. They will always be exited, regardless of test failure/success. The
context stack is specific to the test being run.

This is useful to eliminate per-test boilerplate when context managers are
used. For example, instead of decorating every test with `@mock.patch`, simply
do `self.foo = self.enter_context(mock.patch(...))' in`setUp()`.

> Note: The context managers will always be exited without any error
> information. This is an unfortunate implementation detail due to some
> internals of how unittest runs tests.
Args  
---  
`manager` |  The context manager to enter.   
### `evaluate`

View source

    
    evaluate(
        tensors

Evaluates tensors and returns numpy values.

Args  
---  
`tensors` |  A Tensor or a nested list/tuple of Tensors.   
Returns  
---  
tensors numpy values.

### `get_temp_dir`

View source

    
    get_temp_dir()
    
Returns a unique temporary directory for the test to use.

If you call this method multiple times during in a test, it will return the
same folder. However, across different runs the directories will be different.
This will ensure that across different runs tests will not be able to pollute
each others environment. If you need multiple unique directories within a
single test, you should use tempfile.mkdtemp as follows:
tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=self.get_temp_dir()):

Returns  
---  
string, the path to the unique temporary directory created for this test.  
### `id`

    
    id()
    
### `run`

    
    run(
        result=None
    )
    
### `session`

View source

    
    @contextlib.contextmanager
    session(
        graph=None, config=None, use_gpu=False, force_gpu=False
    )
    
A context manager for a TensorFlow Session for use in executing tests.

Note that this will set this session and the graph as global defaults.

Use the `use_gpu` and `force_gpu` options to control where ops are run. If
`force_gpu` is True, all ops are pinned to `/device:GPU:0`. Otherwise, if
`use_gpu` is True, TensorFlow tries to run as many ops on the GPU as possible.
If both `force_gpu and`use_gpu` are False, all ops are pinned to the CPU.

#### Example:

    
    class MyOperatorTest(test_util.TensorFlowTestCase):
      def testMyOperator(self):
        with self.session(use_gpu=True):
          valid_input = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
          result = MyOperator(valid_input).eval()
          self.assertEqual(result, [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0, 8.0]
          invalid_input = [-1.0, 2.0, 7.0]
          with self.assertRaisesOpError("negative input not supported"):
            MyOperator(invalid_input).eval()
    
Args  
---  
`graph` |  Optional graph to use during the returned session.   
`config` |  An optional config_pb2.ConfigProto to use to configure the session.   
`use_gpu` |  If True, attempt to run as many ops as possible on GPU.   
`force_gpu` |  If True, pin all ops to `/device:GPU:0`.   
Yields  
---  
A Session object that should be used as a context manager to surround the
graph building and execution code in a test case.  
### `setUp`

View source

    
    setUp()
    
Hook method for setting up the test fixture before exercising it.

### `setUpClass`

    
    @classmethod
    setUpClass()
    
Hook method for setting up class fixture before running tests in the class.

### `shortDescription`

    
    shortDescription()
    
Formats both the test method name and the first line of its docstring.

If no docstring is given, only returns the method name.

This method overrides unittest.TestCase.shortDescription(), which only returns
the first line of the docstring, obscuring the name of the test upon failure.

Returns  
---  
`desc` |  A short description of a test method.   
### `skipTest`

    
    skipTest(
        reason
    )
    
Skip this test.

### `subTest`

    
    @contextlib.contextmanager
    subTest(
        msg=_subtest_msg_sentinel, **params
    )
    
Return a context manager that will return the enclosed block of code in a
subtest identified by the optional message and keyword parameters. A failure
in the subtest marks the test case as failed but resumes execution at the end
of the enclosed block, allowing further test code to be executed.

### `tearDown`

View source

    
    tearDown()
    
Hook method for deconstructing the test fixture after testing it.

### `tearDownClass`

    
    @classmethod
    tearDownClass()
    
Hook method for deconstructing the class fixture after running all tests in
the class.

### `test_session`

View source

    
    @contextlib.contextmanager
    test_session(
        graph=None, config=None, use_gpu=False, force_gpu=False
    )
    
Use cached_session instead. (deprecated)

Warning: THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. It will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating: Use `self.session()` or `self.cached_session()`
instead.

### `__call__`

    
    __call__(
        *args, **kwds
    )
    
Call self as a function.

### `__eq__`

    
    __eq__(
        other
    )
    
Return self==value.
