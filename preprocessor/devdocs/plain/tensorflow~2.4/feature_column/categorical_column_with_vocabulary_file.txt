# tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file

View source on GitHub  A `CategoricalColumn` with a vocabulary file.

    
    tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file(
        key, vocabulary_file, vocabulary_size=None, dtype=tf.dtypes.string,
        default_value=None, num_oov_buckets=0
    )
    
Use this when your inputs are in string or integer format, and you have a
vocabulary file that maps each value to an integer ID. By default, out-of-
vocabulary values are ignored. Use either (but not both) of `num_oov_buckets`
and `default_value` to specify how to include out-of-vocabulary values. For
input dictionary `features`, `features[key]` is either `Tensor` or
`SparseTensor`. If `Tensor`, missing values can be represented by `-1` for int
and `''` for string, which will be dropped by this feature column. Example
with `num_oov_buckets`: File `'/us/states.txt'` contains 50 lines, each with a
2-character U.S. state abbreviation. All inputs with values in that file are
assigned an ID 0-49, corresponding to its line number. All other values are
hashed and assigned an ID 50-54.

    
    states = categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file(
        key='states', vocabulary_file='/us/states.txt', vocabulary_size=50,
        num_oov_buckets=5)
    columns = [states, ...]
    features = tf.io.parse_example(..., features=make_parse_example_spec(columns))
    linear_prediction = linear_model(features, columns)
    
Example with `default_value`: File `'/us/states.txt'` contains 51 lines - the
first line is `'XX'`, and the other 50 each have a 2-character U.S. state
abbreviation. Both a literal `'XX'` in input, and other values missing from
the file, will be assigned ID 0. All others are assigned the corresponding
line number 1-50.

    
    states = categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file(
        key='states', vocabulary_file='/us/states.txt', vocabulary_size=51,
        default_value=0)
    columns = [states, ...]
    features = tf.io.parse_example(..., features=make_parse_example_spec(columns))
    linear_prediction, _, _ = linear_model(features, columns)
    
And to make an embedding with either:

    
    columns = [embedding_column(states, 3),...]
    features = tf.io.parse_example(..., features=make_parse_example_spec(columns))
    dense_tensor = input_layer(features, columns)
    
| Args  
---  
`key` |  A unique string identifying the input feature. It is used as the column name and the dictionary key for feature parsing configs, feature `Tensor` objects, and feature columns.   
`vocabulary_file` |  The vocabulary file name.   
`vocabulary_size` |  Number of the elements in the vocabulary. This must be no greater than length of `vocabulary_file`, if less than length, later values are ignored. If None, it is set to the length of `vocabulary_file`.   
`dtype` |  The type of features. Only string and integer types are supported.   
`default_value` |  The integer ID value to return for out-of-vocabulary feature values, defaults to `-1`. This can not be specified with a positive `num_oov_buckets`.   
`num_oov_buckets` |  Non-negative integer, the number of out-of-vocabulary buckets. All out-of-vocabulary inputs will be assigned IDs in the range `[vocabulary_size, vocabulary_size+num_oov_buckets)` based on a hash of the input value. A positive `num_oov_buckets` can not be specified with `default_value`.   
Returns  
---  
A `CategoricalColumn` with a vocabulary file.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  `vocabulary_file` is missing or cannot be opened.   
`ValueError` |  `vocabulary_size` is missing or < 1\.   
`ValueError` |  `num_oov_buckets` is a negative integer.   
`ValueError` |  `num_oov_buckets` and `default_value` are both specified.   
`ValueError` |  `dtype` is neither string nor integer.
