    tf.linalg.svd(
        tensor, full_matrices=False, compute_uv=True, name=None
    )
    
Computes the SVD of each inner matrix in `tensor` such that `tensor[..., :, :]
= u[..., :, :] * diag(s[..., :, :]) * transpose(conj(v[..., :, :]))`

    
    # a is a tensor.
    # s is a tensor of singular values.
    # u is a tensor of left singular vectors.
    # v is a tensor of right singular vectors.
    s, u, v = svd(a)
    s = svd(a, compute_uv=False)
    
| Args  
---  
`tensor` |  `Tensor` of shape `[..., M, N]`. Let `P` be the minimum of `M` and `N`.   
`full_matrices` |  If true, compute full-sized `u` and `v`. If false (the default), compute only the leading `P` singular vectors. Ignored if `compute_uv` is `False`.   
`compute_uv` |  If `True` then left and right singular vectors will be computed and returned in `u` and `v`, respectively. Otherwise, only the singular values will be computed, which can be significantly faster.   
`name` |  string, optional name of the operation.   
Returns  
---  
`s` |  Singular values. Shape is `[..., P]`. The values are sorted in reverse order of magnitude, so s[..., 0] is the largest value, s[..., 1] is the second largest, etc.   
`u` |  Left singular vectors. If `full_matrices` is `False` (default) then shape is `[..., M, P]`; if `full_matrices` is `True` then shape is `[..., M, M]`. Not returned if `compute_uv` is `False`.   
`v` |  Right singular vectors. If `full_matrices` is `False` (default) then shape is `[..., N, P]`. If `full_matrices` is `True` then shape is `[..., N, N]`. Not returned if `compute_uv` is `False`.   
#### Numpy Compatibility

Mostly equivalent to numpy.linalg.svd, except that

  * The order of output arguments here is `s`, `u`, `v` when `compute_uv` is `True`, as opposed to `u`, `s`, `v` for numpy.linalg.svd.
  * full_matrices is `False` by default as opposed to `True` for numpy.linalg.svd.
  * tf.linalg.svd uses the standard definition of the SVD \\(A = U \Sigma V^H\\), such that the left singular vectors of `a` are the columns of `u`, while the right singular vectors of `a` are the columns of `v`. On the other hand, numpy.linalg.svd returns the adjoint \\(V^H\\) as the third output argument.

    
    import tensorflow as tf
    import numpy as np
    s, u, v = tf.linalg.svd(a)
    tf_a_approx = tf.matmul(u, tf.matmul(tf.linalg.diag(s), v, adjoint_b=True))
    u, s, v_adj = np.linalg.svd(a, full_matrices=False)
    np_a_approx = np.dot(u, np.dot(np.diag(s), v_adj))
    # tf_a_approx and np_a_approx should be numerically close.
