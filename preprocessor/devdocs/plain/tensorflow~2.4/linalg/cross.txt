    tf.linalg.cross(
        a, b, name=None
    )
    
`a` and `b` must be the same shape; they can either be simple 3-element
vectors, or any shape where the innermost dimension is 3. In the latter case,
each pair of corresponding 3-element vectors is cross-multiplied
independently.

Args  
---  
`a` |  A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `int64`, `bfloat16`, `uint16`, `half`, `uint32`, `uint64`. A tensor containing 3-element vectors.   
`b` |  A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `a`. Another tensor, of same type and shape as `a`.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `a`.
