    tf.linalg.lstsq(
        matrix, rhs, l2_regularizer=0.0, fast=True, name=None
    )
    
`matrix` is a tensor of shape `[..., M, N]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form `M`-by-`N` matrices. Rhs is a tensor of shape `[..., M, K]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form `M`-by-`K` matrices. The computed output is a `Tensor` of shape `[..., N, K]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form `M`-by-`K` matrices that solve the equations `matrix[..., :, :] * output[..., :, :] = rhs[..., :, :]` in the least squares sense. Below we will use the following notation for each pair of matrix and right-hand sides in the batch: `matrix`=\\(A \in \Re^{m \times n}\\), `rhs`=\\(B \in \Re^{m \times k}\\), `output`=\\(X \in \Re^{n \times k}\\), `l2_regularizer`=\\(\lambda\\). If `fast` is `True`, then the solution is computed by solving the normal equations using Cholesky decomposition. Specifically, if \\(m \ge n\\) then \\(X = (A^T A + \lambda I)^{-1} A^T B\\), which solves the least-squares problem \\(X = \mathrm{argmin}_{Z \in \Re^{n \times k} } ||A Z - B||_F^2 + \lambda ||Z||_F^2\\). If \\(m \lt n\\) then `output` is computed as \\(X = A^T (A A^T + \lambda I)^{-1} B\\), which (for \\(\lambda = 0\\)) is the minimum-norm solution to the under-determined linear system, i.e. \\(X = \mathrm{argmin}_{Z \in \Re^{n \times k} } ||Z||_F^2 \\), subject to \\(A Z = B\\). Notice that the fast path is only numerically stable when \\(A\\) is numerically full rank and has a condition number \\(\mathrm{cond}(A) \lt \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{mach} } }\\) or\\(\lambda\\) is sufficiently large. If `fast` is `False` an algorithm based on the numerically robust complete orthogonal decomposition is used. This computes the minimum-norm least-squares solution, even when \\(A\\) is rank deficient. This path is typically 6-7 times slower than the fast path. If `fast` is `False` then `l2_regularizer` is ignored. | Args
