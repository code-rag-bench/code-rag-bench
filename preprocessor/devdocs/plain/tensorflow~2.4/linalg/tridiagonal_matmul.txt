    tf.linalg.tridiagonal_matmul(
        diagonals, rhs, diagonals_format='compact', name=None
    )
    
`diagonals` is representation of 3-diagonal NxN matrix, which depends on
`diagonals_format`. In `matrix` format, `diagonals` must be a tensor of shape
`[..., M, M]`, with two inner-most dimensions representing the square
tridiagonal matrices. Elements outside of the three diagonals will be ignored.
If `sequence` format, `diagonals` is list or tuple of three tensors:
`[superdiag, maindiag, subdiag]`, each having shape [..., M]. Last element of
`superdiag` first element of `subdiag` are ignored. In `compact` format the
three diagonals are brought together into one tensor of shape `[..., 3, M]`,
with last two dimensions containing superdiagonals, diagonals, and
subdiagonals, in order. Similarly to `sequence` format, elements
`diagonals[..., 0, M-1]` and `diagonals[..., 2, 0]` are ignored. The
`sequence` format is recommended as the one with the best performance. `rhs`
is matrix to the right of multiplication. It has shape `[..., M, N]`.

#### Example:

    
    superdiag = tf.constant([-1, -1, 0], dtype=tf.float64)
    maindiag = tf.constant([2, 2, 2], dtype=tf.float64)
    subdiag = tf.constant([0, -1, -1], dtype=tf.float64)
    diagonals = [superdiag, maindiag, subdiag]
    rhs = tf.constant([[1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1]], dtype=tf.float64)
    x = tf.linalg.tridiagonal_matmul(diagonals, rhs, diagonals_format='sequence')
    
| Args  
---  
`diagonals` |  A `Tensor` or tuple of `Tensor`s describing left-hand sides. The shape depends of `diagonals_format`, see description above. Must be `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, or `complex128`.   
`rhs` |  A `Tensor` of shape [..., M, N] and with the same dtype as `diagonals`.   
`diagonals_format` |  one of `sequence`, or `compact`. Default is `compact`.   
`name` |  A name to give this `Op` (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A `Tensor` of shape [..., M, N] containing the result of multiplication.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  An unsupported type is provided as input, or when the input tensors have incorrect shapes.
