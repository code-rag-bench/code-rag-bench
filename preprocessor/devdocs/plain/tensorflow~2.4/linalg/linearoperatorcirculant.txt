    tf.linalg.LinearOperatorCirculant(
        spectrum, input_output_dtype=tf.dtypes.complex64, is_non_singular=None,
        is_self_adjoint=None, is_positive_definite=None, is_square=True,
        name='LinearOperatorCirculant'
    )
    
This operator acts like a circulant matrix `A` with shape `[B1,...,Bb, N, N]`
for some `b >= 0`. The first `b` indices index a batch member. For every batch
index `(i1,...,ib)`, `A[i1,...,ib, : :]` is an `N x N` matrix. This matrix `A`
is not materialized, but for purposes of broadcasting this shape will be
relevant.

#### Description in terms of circulant matrices

Circulant means the entries of `A` are generated by a single vector, the
convolution kernel `h`: `A_{mn} := h_{m-n mod N}`. With `h = [w, x, y, z]`,

    
    A = |w z y x|
        |x w z y|
        |y x w z|
        |z y x w|
    
This means that the result of matrix multiplication `v = Au` has `Lth` column
given circular convolution between `h` with the `Lth` column of `u`.

#### Description in terms of the frequency spectrum

There is an equivalent description in terms of the [batch] spectrum `H` and
Fourier transforms. Here we consider `A.shape = [N, N]` and ignore batch
dimensions. Define the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its inverse by

    
    DFT[ h[n] ] = H[k] := sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1} h_n e^{-i 2pi k n / N}
    IDFT[ H[k] ] = h[n] = N^{-1} sum_{k = 0}^{N - 1} H_k e^{i 2pi k n / N}
    
From these definitions, we see that

    
    H[0] = sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1} h_n
    H[1] = "the first positive frequency"
    H[N - 1] = "the first negative frequency"
    
Loosely speaking, with `*` element-wise multiplication, matrix multiplication
is equal to the action of a Fourier multiplier: `A u = IDFT[ H * DFT[u] ]`.
Precisely speaking, given `[N, R]` matrix `u`, let `DFT[u]` be the `[N, R]`
matrix with `rth` column equal to the DFT of the `rth` column of `u`. Define
the `IDFT` similarly. Matrix multiplication may be expressed columnwise: `(A
u)_r = IDFT[ H * (DFT[u])_r ]`

#### Operator properties deduced from the spectrum.

Letting `U` be the `kth` Euclidean basis vector, and `U = IDFT[u]`. The above
formulas show that`A U = H_k * U`. We conclude that the elements of `H` are
the eigenvalues of this operator. Therefore

  * This operator is positive definite if and only if `Real{H} > 0`.

A general property of Fourier transforms is the correspondence between
Hermitian functions and real valued transforms. Suppose `H.shape = [B1,...,Bb,
N]`. We say that `H` is a Hermitian spectrum if, with `%` meaning modulus
division, `H[..., n % N] = ComplexConjugate[ H[..., (-n) % N] ]`

  * This operator corresponds to a real matrix if and only if `H` is Hermitian.
  * This operator is self-adjoint if and only if `H` is real.

See e.g. "Discrete-Time Signal Processing", Oppenheim and Schafer.

#### Example of a self-adjoint positive definite operator

    
    # spectrum is real ==> operator is self-adjoint
    # spectrum is positive ==> operator is positive definite
    spectrum = [6., 4, 2]
    
    operator = LinearOperatorCirculant(spectrum)
    
    # IFFT[spectrum]
    operator.convolution_kernel()
    ==> [4 + 0j, 1 + 0.58j, 1 - 0.58j]
    
    operator.to_dense()
    ==> [[4 + 0.0j, 1 - 0.6j, 1 + 0.6j],
         [1 + 0.6j, 4 + 0.0j, 1 - 0.6j],
         [1 - 0.6j, 1 + 0.6j, 4 + 0.0j]]
    
#### Example of defining in terms of a real convolution kernel

    
    # convolution_kernel is real ==> spectrum is Hermitian.
    convolution_kernel = [1., 2., 1.]]
    spectrum = tf.signal.fft(tf.cast(convolution_kernel, tf.complex64))
    
    # spectrum is Hermitian ==> operator is real.
    # spectrum is shape [3] ==> operator is shape [3, 3]
    # We force the input/output type to be real, which allows this to operate
    # like a real matrix.
    operator = LinearOperatorCirculant(spectrum, input_output_dtype=tf.float32)
    
    operator.to_dense()
    ==> [[ 1, 1, 2],
         [ 2, 1, 1],
         [ 1, 2, 1]]
    
#### Example of Hermitian spectrum

    
    # spectrum is shape [3] ==> operator is shape [3, 3]
    # spectrum is Hermitian ==> operator is real.
    spectrum = [1, 1j, -1j]
    
    operator = LinearOperatorCirculant(spectrum)
    
    operator.to_dense()
    ==> [[ 0.33 + 0j,  0.91 + 0j, -0.24 + 0j],
         [-0.24 + 0j,  0.33 + 0j,  0.91 + 0j],
         [ 0.91 + 0j, -0.24 + 0j,  0.33 + 0j]
    
#### Example of forcing real `dtype` when spectrum is Hermitian

    
    # spectrum is shape [4] ==> operator is shape [4, 4]
    # spectrum is real ==> operator is self-adjoint
    # spectrum is Hermitian ==> operator is real
    # spectrum has positive real part ==> operator is positive-definite.
    spectrum = [6., 4, 2, 4]
    
    # Force the input dtype to be float32.
    # Cast the output to float32.  This is fine because the operator will be
    # real due to Hermitian spectrum.
    operator = LinearOperatorCirculant(spectrum, input_output_dtype=tf.float32)
    
    operator.shape
    ==> [4, 4]
    
    operator.to_dense()
    ==> [[4, 1, 0, 1],
         [1, 4, 1, 0],
         [0, 1, 4, 1],
         [1, 0, 1, 4]]
    
    # convolution_kernel = tf.signal.ifft(spectrum)
    operator.convolution_kernel()
    ==> [4, 1, 0, 1]
    
#### Performance

Suppose `operator` is a `LinearOperatorCirculant` of shape `[N, N]`, and
`x.shape = [N, R]`. Then

  * `operator.matmul(x)` is `O(R*N*Log[N])`
  * `operator.solve(x)` is `O(R*N*Log[N])`
  * `operator.determinant()` involves a size `N` `reduce_prod`.

If instead `operator` and `x` have shape `[B1,...,Bb, N, N]` and `[B1,...,Bb,
N, R]`, every operation increases in complexity by `B1*...*Bb`.

#### Matrix property hints

This `LinearOperator` is initialized with boolean flags of the form `is_X`,
for `X = non_singular, self_adjoint, positive_definite, square`. These have
the following meaning:

  * If `is_X == True`, callers should expect the operator to have the property `X`. This is a promise that should be fulfilled, but is not a runtime assert. For example, finite floating point precision may result in these promises being violated.
  * If `is_X == False`, callers should expect the operator to not have `X`.
  * If `is_X == None` (the default), callers should have no expectation either way.

`name` |  A name scope to use for ops added by this method.   
Returns  
---  
`Tensor` with shape `[...,N, R]` and same `dtype` as `rhs`.  
Raises  
---  
`NotImplementedError` |  If `self.is_non_singular` or `is_square` is False.   
### `solvevec`

View source

    
    solvevec(
        rhs, adjoint=False, name='solve'
    )
    
Solve single equation with best effort: `A X = rhs`.

The returned `Tensor` will be close to an exact solution if `A` is well
conditioned. Otherwise closeness will vary. See class docstring for details.

#### Examples:

    
    # Make an operator acting like batch matrix A.  Assume A.shape = [..., M, N]
    operator = LinearOperator(...)
    operator.shape = [..., M, N]
    
    # Solve one linear system for every member of the batch.
    RHS = ... # shape [..., M]
    
    X = operator.solvevec(RHS)
    # X is the solution to the linear system
    # sum_j A[..., :, j] X[..., j] = RHS[..., :]
    
    operator.matvec(X)
    ==> RHS
    
Args  
---  
`rhs` |  `Tensor` with same `dtype` as this operator. `rhs` is treated like a [batch] vector meaning for every set of leading dimensions, the last dimension defines a vector. See class docstring for definition of compatibility regarding batch dimensions.   
`adjoint` |  Python `bool`. If `True`, solve the system involving the adjoint of this `LinearOperator`: `A^H X = rhs`.   
`name` |  A name scope to use for ops added by this method.   
Returns  
---  
`Tensor` with shape `[...,N]` and same `dtype` as `rhs`.  
Raises  
---  
`NotImplementedError` |  If `self.is_non_singular` or `is_square` is False.   
### `tensor_rank_tensor`

View source

    
    tensor_rank_tensor(
        name='tensor_rank_tensor'
    )
    
Rank (in the sense of tensors) of matrix corresponding to this operator.

If this operator acts like the batch matrix `A` with `A.shape = [B1,...,Bb, M,
N]`, then this returns `b + 2`.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for this `Op`.   
Returns  
---  
`int32` `Tensor`, determined at runtime.  
### `to_dense`

View source

    
    to_dense(
        name='to_dense'
    )
    
Return a dense (batch) matrix representing this operator.

### `trace`

View source

    
    trace(
        name='trace'
    )
    
Trace of the linear operator, equal to sum of `self.diag_part()`.

If the operator is square, this is also the sum of the eigenvalues.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for this `Op`.   
Returns  
---  
Shape `[B1,...,Bb]` `Tensor` of same `dtype` as `self`.  
### `__matmul__`
