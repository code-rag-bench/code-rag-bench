`tf.compat.v1.linalg.LinearOperatorIdentity`

    
    tf.linalg.LinearOperatorIdentity(
        num_rows, batch_shape=None, dtype=None, is_non_singular=True,
        is_self_adjoint=True, is_positive_definite=True, is_square=True,
        assert_proper_shapes=False, name='LinearOperatorIdentity'
    )
    
This operator acts like a [batch] identity matrix `A` with shape `[B1,...,Bb,
N, N]` for some `b >= 0`. The first `b` indices index a batch member. For
every batch index `(i1,...,ib)`, `A[i1,...,ib, : :]` is an `N x N` matrix.
This matrix `A` is not materialized, but for purposes of broadcasting this
shape will be relevant. `LinearOperatorIdentity` is initialized with
`num_rows`, and optionally `batch_shape`, and `dtype` arguments. If
`batch_shape` is `None`, this operator efficiently passes through all
arguments. If `batch_shape` is provided, broadcasting may occur, which will
require making copies.

    
    # Create a 2 x 2 identity matrix.
    operator = LinearOperatorIdentity(num_rows=2, dtype=tf.float32)
    
    operator.to_dense()
    ==> [[1., 0.]
         [0., 1.]]
    
    operator.shape
    ==> [2, 2]
    
    operator.log_abs_determinant()
    ==> 0.
    
    x = ... Shape [2, 4] Tensor
    operator.matmul(x)
    ==> Shape [2, 4] Tensor, same as x.
    
    y = tf.random.normal(shape=[3, 2, 4])
    # Note that y.shape is compatible with operator.shape because operator.shape
    # is broadcast to [3, 2, 2].
    # This broadcast does NOT require copying data, since we can infer that y
    # will be passed through without changing shape.  We are always able to infer
    # this if the operator has no batch_shape.
    x = operator.solve(y)
    ==> Shape [3, 2, 4] Tensor, same as y.
    
    # Create a 2-batch of 2x2 identity matrices
    operator = LinearOperatorIdentity(num_rows=2, batch_shape=[2])
    operator.to_dense()
    ==> [[[1., 0.]
          [0., 1.]],
         [[1., 0.]
          [0., 1.]]]
    
    # Here, even though the operator has a batch shape, the input is the same as
    # the output, so x can be passed through without a copy.  The operator is able
    # to detect that no broadcast is necessary because both x and the operator
    # have statically defined shape.
    x = ... Shape [2, 2, 3]
    operator.matmul(x)
    ==> Shape [2, 2, 3] Tensor, same as x
    
    # Here the operator and x have different batch_shape, and are broadcast.
    # This requires a copy, since the output is different size than the input.
    x = ... Shape [1, 2, 3]
    operator.matmul(x)
    ==> Shape [2, 2, 3] Tensor, equal to [x, x]
    
### Shape compatibility

This operator acts on [batch] matrix with compatible shape. `x` is a batch
matrix with compatible shape for `matmul` and `solve` if

    
    operator.shape = [B1,...,Bb] + [N, N],  with b >= 0
    x.shape =   [C1,...,Cc] + [N, R],
    and [C1,...,Cc] broadcasts with [B1,...,Bb] to [D1,...,Dd]
    
### Performance

If `batch_shape` initialization arg is `None`:

  * `operator.matmul(x)` is `O(1)`
  * `operator.solve(x)` is `O(1)`
  * `operator.determinant()` is `O(1)`

If `batch_shape` initialization arg is provided, and static checks cannot rule
out the need to broadcast:

  * `operator.matmul(x)` is `O(D1*...*Dd*N*R)`
  * `operator.solve(x)` is `O(D1*...*Dd*N*R)`
  * `operator.determinant()` is `O(B1*...*Bb)`

#### Matrix property hints

This `LinearOperator` is initialized with boolean flags of the form `is_X`,
for `X = non_singular, self_adjoint, positive_definite, square`. These have
the following meaning:

  * If `is_X == True`, callers should expect the operator to have the property `X`. This is a promise that should be fulfilled, but is not a runtime assert. For example, finite floating point precision may result in these promises being violated.
  * If `is_X == False`, callers should expect the operator to not have `X`.
  * If `is_X == None` (the default), callers should have no expectation either way.
