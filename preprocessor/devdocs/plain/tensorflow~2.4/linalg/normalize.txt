    tf.linalg.normalize(
        tensor, ord='euclidean', axis=None, name=None
    )
    
This uses `tf.linalg.norm` to compute the norm along `axis`. This function can compute several different vector norms (the 1-norm, the Euclidean or 2-norm, the inf-norm, and in general the p-norm for p > 0) and matrix norms (Frobenius, 1-norm, 2-norm and inf-norm). | Args  
---  
`tensor` |  `Tensor` of types `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, `complex128`  
`ord` |  Order of the norm. Supported values are `'fro'`, `'euclidean'`, `1`, `2`, `np.inf` and any positive real number yielding the corresponding p-norm. Default is `'euclidean'` which is equivalent to Frobenius norm if `tensor` is a matrix and equivalent to 2-norm for vectors. Some restrictions apply: a) The Frobenius norm `'fro'` is not defined for vectors, b) If axis is a 2-tuple (matrix norm), only `'euclidean'`, '`fro'`, `1`, `2`, `np.inf` are supported. See the description of `axis` on how to compute norms for a batch of vectors or matrices stored in a tensor.   
`axis` |  If `axis` is `None` (the default), the input is considered a vector and a single vector norm is computed over the entire set of values in the tensor, i.e. `norm(tensor, ord=ord)` is equivalent to `norm(reshape(tensor, [-1]), ord=ord)`. If `axis` is a Python integer, the input is considered a batch of vectors, and `axis` determines the axis in `tensor` over which to compute vector norms. If `axis` is a 2-tuple of Python integers it is considered a batch of matrices and `axis` determines the axes in `tensor` over which to compute a matrix norm. Negative indices are supported. Example: If you are passing a tensor that can be either a matrix or a batch of matrices at runtime, pass `axis=[-2,-1]` instead of `axis=None` to make sure that matrix norms are computed.   
`name` |  The name of the op.   
Returns  
---  
`normalized` |  A normalized `Tensor` with the same shape as `tensor`.   
`norm` |  The computed norms with the same shape and dtype `tensor` but the final axis is 1 instead. Same as running `tf.cast(tf.linalg.norm(tensor, ord, axis keepdims=True), tensor.dtype)`.   
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  If `ord` or `axis` is invalid.
