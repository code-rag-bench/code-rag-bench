    tf.linalg.LinearOperatorCirculant2D(
        spectrum, input_output_dtype=tf.dtypes.complex64, is_non_singular=None,
        is_self_adjoint=None, is_positive_definite=None, is_square=True,
        name='LinearOperatorCirculant2D'
    )
    
This operator acts like a block circulant matrix `A` with shape `[B1,...,Bb,
N, N]` for some `b >= 0`. The first `b` indices index a batch member. For
every batch index `(i1,...,ib)`, `A[i1,...,ib, : :]` is an `N x N` matrix.
This matrix `A` is not materialized, but for purposes of broadcasting this
shape will be relevant.

#### Description in terms of block circulant matrices

If `A` is block circulant, with block sizes `N0, N1` (`N0 * N1 = N`): `A` has
a block circulant structure, composed of `N0 x N0` blocks, with each block an
`N1 x N1` circulant matrix. For example, with `W`, `X`, `Y`, `Z` each
circulant,

    
    A = |W Z Y X|
        |X W Z Y|
        |Y X W Z|
        |Z Y X W|
    
Note that `A` itself will not in general be circulant.

#### Description in terms of the frequency spectrum

There is an equivalent description in terms of the [batch] spectrum `H` and
Fourier transforms. Here we consider `A.shape = [N, N]` and ignore batch
dimensions. If `H.shape = [N0, N1]`, (`N0 * N1 = N`): Loosely speaking, matrix
multiplication is equal to the action of a Fourier multiplier: `A u = IDFT2[ H
DFT2[u] ]`. Precisely speaking, given `[N, R]` matrix `u`, let `DFT2[u]` be
the `[N0, N1, R]` `Tensor` defined by re-shaping `u` to `[N0, N1, R]` and
taking a two dimensional DFT across the first two dimensions. Let `IDFT2` be
the inverse of `DFT2`. Matrix multiplication may be expressed columnwise: `(A
u)_r = IDFT2[ H * (DFT2[u])_r ]`

#### Operator properties deduced from the spectrum.

  * This operator is positive definite if and only if `Real{H} > 0`.

A general property of Fourier transforms is the correspondence between
Hermitian functions and real valued transforms. Suppose `H.shape = [B1,...,Bb,
N0, N1]`, we say that `H` is a Hermitian spectrum if, with `%` indicating
modulus division,

    
    H[..., n0 % N0, n1 % N1] = ComplexConjugate[ H[..., (-n0) % N0, (-n1) % N1 ].
    
  * This operator corresponds to a real matrix if and only if `H` is Hermitian.
  * This operator is self-adjoint if and only if `H` is real.

See e.g. "Discrete-Time Signal Processing", Oppenheim and Schafer.

### Example of a self-adjoint positive definite operator

    
    # spectrum is real ==> operator is self-adjoint
    # spectrum is positive ==> operator is positive definite
    spectrum = [[1., 2., 3.],
                [4., 5., 6.],
                [7., 8., 9.]]
    
    operator = LinearOperatorCirculant2D(spectrum)
    
    # IFFT[spectrum]
    operator.convolution_kernel()
    ==> [[5.0+0.0j, -0.5-.3j, -0.5+.3j],
         [-1.5-.9j,        0,        0],
         [-1.5+.9j,        0,        0]]
    
    operator.to_dense()
    ==> Complex self adjoint 9 x 9 matrix.
    
#### Example of defining in terms of a real convolution kernel,

    
    # convolution_kernel is real ==> spectrum is Hermitian.
    convolution_kernel = [[1., 2., 1.], [5., -1., 1.]]
    spectrum = tf.signal.fft2d(tf.cast(convolution_kernel, tf.complex64))
    
    # spectrum is shape [2, 3] ==> operator is shape [6, 6]
    # spectrum is Hermitian ==> operator is real.
    operator = LinearOperatorCirculant2D(spectrum, input_output_dtype=tf.float32)
    
#### Performance

Suppose `operator` is a `LinearOperatorCirculant` of shape `[N, N]`, and
`x.shape = [N, R]`. Then

  * `operator.matmul(x)` is `O(R*N*Log[N])`
  * `operator.solve(x)` is `O(R*N*Log[N])`
  * `operator.determinant()` involves a size `N` `reduce_prod`.

If instead `operator` and `x` have shape `[B1,...,Bb, N, N]` and `[B1,...,Bb,
N, R]`, every operation increases in complexity by `B1*...*Bb`.

#### Matrix property hints

This `LinearOperator` is initialized with boolean flags of the form `is_X`,
for `X = non_singular, self_adjoint, positive_definite, square`. These have
the following meaning

  * If `is_X == True`, callers should expect the operator to have the property `X`. This is a promise that should be fulfilled, but is not a runtime assert. For example, finite floating point precision may result in these promises being violated.
  * If `is_X == False`, callers should expect the operator to not have `X`.
  * If `is_X == None` (the default), callers should have no expectation either way.

If the operator is square, this is also the sum of the eigenvalues.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for this `Op`.   
Returns
