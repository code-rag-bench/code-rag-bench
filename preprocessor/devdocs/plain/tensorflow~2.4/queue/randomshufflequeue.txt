See `tf.queue.QueueBase` for a description of the methods on this class. | Args  
---  
`capacity` |  An integer. The upper bound on the number of elements that may be stored in this queue.   
`min_after_dequeue` |  An integer (described above).   
`dtypes` |  A list of `DType` objects. The length of `dtypes` must equal the number of tensors in each queue element.

`names` |  (Optional.) A list of string naming the components in the queue with the same length as `dtypes`, or `None`. If specified the dequeue methods return a dictionary with the names as keys.   
`seed` |  A Python integer. Used to create a random seed. See `tf.compat.v1.set_random_seed` for behavior.   
`shared_name` |  (Optional.) If non-empty, this queue will be shared under the given name across multiple sessions.   
`name` |  Optional name for the queue operation.

## Methods

### `close`

View source

    
    close(
        cancel_pending_enqueues=False, name=None
    )
    
Closes this queue.

This operation signals that no more elements will be enqueued in the given
queue. Subsequent `enqueue` and `enqueue_many` operations will fail.
Subsequent `dequeue` and `dequeue_many` operations will continue to succeed if
sufficient elements remain in the queue. Subsequently dequeue and dequeue_many
operations that would otherwise block waiting for more elements (if close
hadn't been called) will now fail immediately.

If `cancel_pending_enqueues` is `True`, all pending requests will also be
canceled.

Args  
---  
`cancel_pending_enqueues` |  (Optional.) A boolean, defaulting to `False` (described above).   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The operation that closes the queue.  
### `dequeue`

View source

    
    dequeue(
        name=None
    )
    
Dequeues one element from this queue.

If the queue is empty when this operation executes, it will block until there
is an element to dequeue.

At runtime, this operation may raise an error if the queue is
`tf.QueueBase.close` before or during its execution. If the queue is closed,
the queue is empty, and there are no pending enqueue operations that can
fulfill this request, `tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` will be raised. If the
session is `tf.Session.close`, `tf.errors.CancelledError` will be raised.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The tuple of tensors that was dequeued.  
### `dequeue_many`

View source

    
    dequeue_many(
        n, name=None
    )
    
Dequeues and concatenates `n` elements from this queue.

This operation concatenates queue-element component tensors along the 0th
dimension to make a single component tensor. All of the components in the
dequeued tuple will have size `n` in the 0th dimension.

If the queue is closed and there are less than `n` elements left, then an
`OutOfRange` exception is raised.

At runtime, this operation may raise an error if the queue is
`tf.QueueBase.close` before or during its execution. If the queue is closed,
the queue contains fewer than `n` elements, and there are no pending enqueue
operations that can fulfill this request, `tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` will be
raised. If the session is `tf.Session.close`, `tf.errors.CancelledError` will
be raised.

Args  
---  
`n` |  A scalar `Tensor` containing the number of elements to dequeue.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The list of concatenated tensors that was dequeued.  
### `dequeue_up_to`

View source

    
    dequeue_up_to(
        n, name=None
    )
    
Dequeues and concatenates `n` elements from this queue.

> Note: This operation is not supported by all queues. If a queue does not
> support DequeueUpTo, then a `tf.errors.UnimplementedError` is raised.
This operation concatenates queue-element component tensors along the 0th
dimension to make a single component tensor. If the queue has not been closed,
all of the components in the dequeued tuple will have size `n` in the 0th
dimension.

If the queue is closed and there are more than `0` but fewer than `n` elements
remaining, then instead of raising a `tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` like
`tf.QueueBase.dequeue_many`, less than `n` elements are returned immediately.
If the queue is closed and there are `0` elements left in the queue, then a
`tf.errors.OutOfRangeError` is raised just like in `dequeue_many`. Otherwise
the behavior is identical to `dequeue_many`.

Args  
---  
`n` |  A scalar `Tensor` containing the number of elements to dequeue.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The tuple of concatenated tensors that was dequeued.  
### `enqueue`

View source

    
    enqueue(
        vals, name=None
    )
    
Enqueues one element to this queue.

If the queue is full when this operation executes, it will block until the
element has been enqueued.

At runtime, this operation may raise an error if the queue is
`tf.QueueBase.close` before or during its execution. If the queue is closed
before this operation runs, `tf.errors.CancelledError` will be raised. If this
operation is blocked, and either (i) the queue is closed by a close operation
with `cancel_pending_enqueues=True`, or (ii) the session is
`tf.Session.close`, `tf.errors.CancelledError` will be raised.

Args  
---  
`vals` |  A tensor, a list or tuple of tensors, or a dictionary containing the values to enqueue.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The operation that enqueues a new tuple of tensors to the queue.  
### `enqueue_many`

View source

    
    enqueue_many(
        vals, name=None
    )
    
Enqueues zero or more elements to this queue.

This operation slices each component tensor along the 0th dimension to make
multiple queue elements. All of the tensors in `vals` must have the same size
in the 0th dimension.

If the queue is full when this operation executes, it will block until all of
the elements have been enqueued.

At runtime, this operation may raise an error if the queue is
`tf.QueueBase.close` before or during its execution. If the queue is closed
before this operation runs, `tf.errors.CancelledError` will be raised. If this
operation is blocked, and either (i) the queue is closed by a close operation
with `cancel_pending_enqueues=True`, or (ii) the session is
`tf.Session.close`, `tf.errors.CancelledError` will be raised.

Args  
---  
`vals` |  A tensor, a list or tuple of tensors, or a dictionary from which the queue elements are taken.   
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
The operation that enqueues a batch of tuples of tensors to the queue.  
### `from_list`

View source

    
    @staticmethod
    from_list(
        index, queues
    )
    
Create a queue using the queue reference from `queues[index]`.

Args  
---  
`index` |  An integer scalar tensor that determines the input that gets selected.   
`queues` |  A list of `QueueBase` objects.   
Returns  
---  
A `QueueBase` object.  
Raises  
---  
`TypeError` |  When `queues` is not a list of `QueueBase` objects, or when the data types of `queues` are not all the same.   
### `is_closed`

View source

    
    is_closed(
        name=None
    )
    
Returns true if queue is closed.

This operation returns true if the queue is closed and false if the queue is
open.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
True if the queue is closed and false if the queue is open.  
### `size`

View source

    
    size(
        name=None
    )
    
Compute the number of elements in this queue.

Args  
---  
`name` |  A name for the operation (optional).   
Returns  
---  
A scalar tensor containing the number of elements in this queue.
