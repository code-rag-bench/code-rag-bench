# tf.constant

View source on GitHub  Creates a constant tensor from a tensor-like object.

    
    tf.constant(
        value, dtype=None, shape=None, name='Const'
    )
    
> Note: All eager `tf.Tensor` values are immutable (in contrast to
> `tf.Variable`). There is nothing especially constant about the value
> returned from `tf.constant`. This function it is not fundamentally different
> from `tf.convert_to_tensor`. The name `tf.constant` comes from the `value`
> being embeded in a `Const` node in the `tf.Graph`. `tf.constant` is useful
> for asserting that the value can be embedded that way.
If the argument `dtype` is not specified, then the type is inferred from the
type of `value`.

    
    # Constant 1-D Tensor from a python list.
    tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(6,), dtype=int32,
        numpy=array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], dtype=int32)>
    # Or a numpy array
    a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    tf.constant(a)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 3), dtype=int64, numpy=
      array([[1, 2, 3],
             [4, 5, 6]])>
    
If `dtype` is specified the resulting tensor values are cast to the requested
`dtype`.

    
    tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], dtype=tf.float64)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(6,), dtype=float64,
        numpy=array([1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6.])>
    
If `shape` is set, the `value` is reshaped to match. Scalars are expanded to
fill the `shape`:

    
    tf.constant(0, shape=(2, 3))
      <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32, numpy=
      array([[0, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 0]], dtype=int32)>
    tf.constant([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], shape=[2, 3])
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(2, 3), dtype=int32, numpy=
      array([[1, 2, 3],
             [4, 5, 6]], dtype=int32)>
    
`tf.constant` has no effect if an eager Tensor is passed as the `value`, it
even transmits gradients:

    
    v = tf.Variable([0.0])
    with tf.GradientTape() as g:
        loss = tf.constant(v + v)
    g.gradient(loss, v).numpy()
    array([2.], dtype=float32)
    
But, since `tf.constant` embeds the value in the `tf.Graph` this fails for
symbolic tensors:

    
    with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default():
      i = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(shape=[None, None], dtype=tf.float32)
      t = tf.constant(i)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    
    TypeError: ...
    
`tf.constant` will always create CPU (host) tensors. In order to create
tensors on other devices, use `tf.identity`. (If the `value` is an eager
Tensor, however, the tensor will be returned unmodified as mentioned above.)

#### Related Ops:

  * `tf.convert_to_tensor` is similar but: 
    * It has no `shape` argument.
    * Symbolic tensors are allowed to pass through.

    
    with tf.compat.v1.Graph().as_default():
      i = tf.compat.v1.placeholder(shape=[None, None], dtype=tf.float32)
      t = tf.convert_to_tensor(i)
      
    
  * `tf.fill`: differs in a few ways: 
    * `tf.constant` supports arbitrary constants, not just uniform scalar Tensors like `tf.fill`.
    * `tf.fill` creates an Op in the graph that is expanded at runtime, so it can efficiently represent large tensors.
    * Since `tf.fill` does not embed the value, it can produce dynamically sized outputs.
