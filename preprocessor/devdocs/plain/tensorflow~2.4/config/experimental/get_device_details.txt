`tf.compat.v1.config.experimental.get_device_details`

    
    tf.config.experimental.get_device_details(
        device
    )
    
This API takes in a `tf.config.PhysicalDevice` returned by
`tf.config.list_physical_devices`. It returns a dict with string keys
containing various details about the device. Each key is only supported by a
subset of devices, so you should not assume the returned dict will have any
particular key.

    
    gpu_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
    if gpu_devices:
      details = tf.config.experimental.get_device_details(gpu_devices[0])
      details.get('device_name', 'Unknown GPU')
    
Currently, details are only returned for GPUs. This function returns an empty
dict if passed a non-GPU device.

The returned dict may have the following keys:

  * `'device_name'`: A human-readable name of the device as a string, e.g. "Titan V". Unlike `tf.config.PhysicalDevice.name`, this will be the same for multiple devices if each device is the same model. Currently only available for GPUs.
  * `'compute_capability'`: The compute capability of the device as a tuple of two ints, in the form `(major_version, minor_version)`. Only available for NVIDIA GPUs

> Note: This is similar to `tf.sysconfig.get_build_info` in that both
> functions can return information relating to GPUs. However, this function
> returns run-time information about a specific device (such as a GPU's
> compute capability), while `tf.sysconfig.get_build_info` returns compile-
> time information about how TensorFlow was built (such as what version of
> CUDA TensorFlow was built for).
