    tf.keras.layers.GaussianNoise(
        stddev, **kwargs
    )
    
This is useful to mitigate overfitting (you could see it as a form of random data augmentation). Gaussian Noise (GS) is a natural choice as corruption process for real valued inputs. As it is a regularization layer, it is only active at training time. | Arguments  
---  
`stddev` |  Float, standard deviation of the noise distribution.   
#### Call arguments:

  * `inputs`: Input tensor (of any rank).
  * `training`: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in training mode (adding noise) or in inference mode (doing nothing).

#### Input shape:

Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape` (tuple of integers, does not
include the samples axis) when using this layer as the first layer in a model.

#### Output shape:

Same shape as input.
