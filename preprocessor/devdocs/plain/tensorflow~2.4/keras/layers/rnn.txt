---  
`cell` |  A RNN cell instance or a list of RNN cell instances. A RNN cell is a class that has: 
  * A `call(input_at_t, states_at_t)` method, returning `(output_at_t, states_at_t_plus_1)`. The call method of the cell can also take the optional argument `constants`, see section "Note on passing external constants" below.
  * A `state_size` attribute. This can be a single integer (single state) in which case it is the size of the recurrent state. This can also be a list/tuple of integers (one size per state). The `state_size` can also be TensorShape or tuple/list of TensorShape, to represent high dimension state.
  * A `output_size` attribute. This can be a single integer or a TensorShape, which represent the shape of the output. For backward compatible reason, if this attribute is not available for the cell, the value will be inferred by the first element of the `state_size`.
  * A `get_initial_state(inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=None)` method that creates a tensor meant to be fed to `call()` as the initial state, if the user didn't specify any initial state via other means. The returned initial state should have a shape of [batch_size, cell.state_size]. The cell might choose to create a tensor full of zeros, or full of other values based on the cell's implementation. `inputs` is the input tensor to the RNN layer, which should contain the batch size as its shape[0], and also dtype. Note that the shape[0] might be `None` during the graph construction. Either the `inputs` or the pair of `batch_size` and `dtype` are provided. `batch_size` is a scalar tensor that represents the batch size of the inputs. `dtype` is `tf.DType` that represents the dtype of the inputs. For backward compatible reason, if this method is not implemented by the cell, the RNN layer will create a zero filled tensor with the size of [batch_size, cell.state_size]. In the case that `cell` is a list of RNN cell instances, the cells will be stacked on top of each other in the RNN, resulting in an efficient stacked RNN. 

  
`return_sequences` |  Boolean (default `False`). Whether to return the last output in the output sequence, or the full sequence.   
`return_state` |  Boolean (default `False`). Whether to return the last state in addition to the output.   
`go_backwards` |  Boolean (default `False`). If True, process the input sequence backwards and return the reversed sequence.   
`stateful` |  Boolean (default `False`). If True, the last state for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial state for the sample of index i in the following batch.   
`unroll` |  Boolean (default `False`). If True, the network will be unrolled, else a symbolic loop will be used. Unrolling can speed-up a RNN, although it tends to be more memory-intensive. Unrolling is only suitable for short sequences.   
`time_major` |  The shape format of the `inputs` and `outputs` tensors. If True, the inputs and outputs will be in shape `(timesteps, batch, ...)`, whereas in the False case, it will be `(batch, timesteps, ...)`. Using `time_major = True` is a bit more efficient because it avoids transposes at the beginning and end of the RNN calculation. However, most TensorFlow data is batch-major, so by default this function accepts input and emits output in batch-major form.   
`zero_output_for_mask` |  Boolean (default `False`). Whether the output should use zeros for the masked timesteps. Note that this field is only used when `return_sequences` is True and mask is provided. It can useful if you want to reuse the raw output sequence of the RNN without interference from the masked timesteps, eg, merging bidirectional RNNs.   
#### Call arguments:

  * `inputs`: Input tensor.
  * `mask`: Binary tensor of shape `[batch_size, timesteps]` indicating whether a given timestep should be masked.
  * `training`: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in training mode or in inference mode. This argument is passed to the cell when calling it. This is for use with cells that use dropout.
  * `initial_state`: List of initial state tensors to be passed to the first call of the cell.
  * `constants`: List of constant tensors to be passed to the cell at each timestep.

#### Input shape:

N-D tensor with shape `[batch_size, timesteps, ...]` or `[timesteps,
batch_size, ...]` when time_major is True.

#### Output shape:

  * If `return_state`: a list of tensors. The first tensor is the output. The remaining tensors are the last states, each with shape `[batch_size, state_size]`, where `state_size` could be a high dimension tensor shape.
  * If `return_sequences`: N-D tensor with shape `[batch_size, timesteps, output_size]`, where `output_size` could be a high dimension tensor shape, or `[timesteps, batch_size, output_size]` when `time_major` is True.
  * Else, N-D tensor with shape `[batch_size, output_size]`, where `output_size` could be a high dimension tensor shape.

#### Masking:

This layer supports masking for input data with a variable number of
timesteps. To introduce masks to your data, use an [tf.keras.layers.Embedding]
layer with the `mask_zero` parameter set to `True`.

Note on using statefulness in RNNs: You can set RNN layers to be 'stateful',
which means that the states computed for the samples in one batch will be
reused as initial states for the samples in the next batch. This assumes a
one-to-one mapping between samples in different successive batches.

To enable statefulness:

    
    - Specify `stateful=True` in the layer constructor.
    - Specify a fixed batch size for your model, by passing
      If sequential model:
        `batch_input_shape=(...)` to the first layer in your model.
      Else for functional model with 1 or more Input layers:
        `batch_shape=(...)` to all the first layers in your model.
      This is the expected shape of your inputs
      *including the batch size*.
      It should be a tuple of integers, e.g. `(32, 10, 100)`.
    - Specify `shuffle=False` when calling `fit()`.
    
To reset the states of your model, call `.reset_states()` on either a specific
layer, or on your entire model.

Note on specifying the initial state of RNNs: You can specify the initial
state of RNN layers symbolically by calling them with the keyword argument
`initial_state`. The value of `initial_state` should be a tensor or list of
tensors representing the initial state of the RNN layer.

You can specify the initial state of RNN layers numerically by calling
`reset_states` with the keyword argument `states`. The value of `states`
should be a numpy array or list of numpy arrays representing the initial state
of the RNN layer.

Note on passing external constants to RNNs: You can pass "external" constants
to the cell using the `constants` keyword argument of `RNN.call` (as well as
`RNN.call`) method. This requires that the `cell.call` method accepts the same
keyword argument `constants`. Such constants can be used to condition the cell
transformation on additional static inputs (not changing over time), a.k.a. an
attention mechanism.

            self.units = units
            self.state_size = units
            super(MinimalRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    
        def build(self, input_shape):
            self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                          initializer='uniform',
                                          name='kernel')
            self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
                shape=(self.units, self.units),
                initializer='uniform',
                name='recurrent_kernel')
            self.built = True
    
        def call(self, inputs, states):
            prev_output = states[0]
            h = K.dot(inputs, self.kernel)
            output = h + K.dot(prev_output, self.recurrent_kernel)
            return output, [output]
    
    # Let's use this cell in a RNN layer:
    
    cell = MinimalRNNCell(32)
    x = keras.Input((None, 5))
    layer = RNN(cell)
    y = layer(x)
    
    # Here's how to use the cell to build a stacked RNN:
    
    cells = [MinimalRNNCell(32), MinimalRNNCell(64)]
    x = keras.Input((None, 5))
    layer = RNN(cells)
    y = layer(x)

### `reset_states`

View source

    
    reset_states(
        states=None
    )
    
Reset the recorded states for the stateful RNN layer.

Can only be used when RNN layer is constructed with `stateful` = `True`. Args:
states: Numpy arrays that contains the value for the initial state, which will
be feed to cell at the first time step. When the value is None, zero filled
numpy array will be created based on the cell state size.

Raises  
---  
`AttributeError` |  When the RNN layer is not stateful.   
`ValueError` |  When the batch size of the RNN layer is unknown.   
`ValueError` |  When the input numpy array is not compatible with the RNN layer state, either size wise or dtype wise.
