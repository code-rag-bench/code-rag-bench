    tf.keras.layers.AlphaDropout(
        rate, noise_shape=None, seed=None, **kwargs
    )
    
Alpha Dropout is a `Dropout` that keeps mean and variance of inputs to their original values, in order to ensure the self-normalizing property even after this dropout. Alpha Dropout fits well to Scaled Exponential Linear Units by randomly setting activations to the negative saturation value. | Arguments  
---  
`rate` |  float, drop probability (as with `Dropout`). The multiplicative noise will have standard deviation `sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))`.   
`seed` |  A Python integer to use as random seed.   
#### Call arguments:

  * `inputs`: Input tensor (of any rank).
  * `training`: Python boolean indicating whether the layer should behave in training mode (adding dropout) or in inference mode (doing nothing).

#### Input shape:

Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument `input_shape` (tuple of integers, does not
include the samples axis) when using this layer as the first layer in a model.

#### Output shape:

Same shape as input.
