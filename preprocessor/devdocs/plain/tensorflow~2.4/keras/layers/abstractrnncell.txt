        trainable=True, name=None, dtype=None, dynamic=False, **kwargs
    )
    
See the Keras RNN API guide for details about the usage of RNN API. This is
the base class for implementing RNN cells with custom behavior. Every
`RNNCell` must have the properties below and implement `call` with the
signature `(output, next_state) = call(input, state)`.

#### Examples:

    
    class MinimalRNNCell(AbstractRNNCell):
    
      def __init__(self, units, **kwargs):
        self.units = units
        super(MinimalRNNCell, self).__init__(**kwargs)
    
      @property
      def state_size(self):
        return self.units
    
      def build(self, input_shape):
        self.kernel = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units),
                                      initializer='uniform',
                                      name='kernel')
        self.recurrent_kernel = self.add_weight(
            shape=(self.units, self.units),
            initializer='uniform',
            name='recurrent_kernel')
        self.built = True
    
      def call(self, inputs, states):
        prev_output = states[0]
        h = K.dot(inputs, self.kernel)
        output = h + K.dot(prev_output, self.recurrent_kernel)
        return output, output
    
This definition of cell differs from the definition used in the literature. In the literature, 'cell' refers to an object with a single scalar output. This definition refers to a horizontal array of such units. An RNN cell, in the most abstract setting, is anything that has a state and performs some operation that takes a matrix of inputs. This operation results in an output matrix with `self.output_size` columns. If `self.state_size` is an integer, this operation also results in a new state matrix with `self.state_size` columns. If `self.state_size` is a (possibly nested tuple of) TensorShape object(s), then it should return a matching structure of Tensors having shape `[batch_size].concatenate(s)` for each `s` in `self.batch_size`. | Attributes  
---  
`output_size` |  Integer or TensorShape: size of outputs produced by this cell.   
`state_size` |  size(s) of state(s) used by this cell. It can be represented by an Integer, a TensorShape or a tuple of Integers or TensorShapes.
