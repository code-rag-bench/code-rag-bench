# tf.keras.utils.Sequence

View source on GitHub  Base object for fitting to a sequence of data, such as
a dataset.

`tf.compat.v1.keras.utils.Sequence` Every `Sequence` must implement the
`__getitem__` and the `__len__` methods. If you want to modify your dataset
between epochs you may implement `on_epoch_end`. The method `__getitem__`
should return a complete batch.

#### Notes:

`Sequence` are a safer way to do multiprocessing. This structure guarantees
that the network will only train once on each sample per epoch which is not
the case with generators.

#### Examples:

    
    from skimage.io import imread
    from skimage.transform import resize
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    # Here, `x_set` is list of path to the images
    # and `y_set` are the associated classes.
    
    class CIFAR10Sequence(Sequence):
    
        def __init__(self, x_set, y_set, batch_size):
            self.x, self.y = x_set, y_set
            self.batch_size = batch_size
    
        def __len__(self):
            return math.ceil(len(self.x) / self.batch_size)
    
        def __getitem__(self, idx):
            batch_x = self.x[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) *
            self.batch_size]
            batch_y = self.y[idx * self.batch_size:(idx + 1) *
            self.batch_size]
    
            return np.array([
                resize(imread(file_name), (200, 200))
                   for file_name in batch_x]), np.array(batch_y)
    
## Methods

### `on_epoch_end`

View source

    
    on_epoch_end()
    
Method called at the end of every epoch.

### `__getitem__`

View source

    
    __getitem__(
        index
    )
    
Gets batch at position `index`. | Arguments  
---  
`index` |  position of the batch in the Sequence.   
Returns  
---  
A batch  
### `__iter__`

View source

    
    __iter__()
    
Create a generator that iterate over the Sequence.

### `__len__`

View source

    
    __len__()
    
Number of batch in the Sequence.

Returns  
---  
The number of batches in the Sequence.
