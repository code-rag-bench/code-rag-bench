`tf.compat.v1.keras.regularizers.Regularizer` Regularizers allow you to apply
penalties on layer parameters or layer activity during optimization. These
penalties are summed into the loss function that the network optimizes.
Regularization penalties are applied on a per-layer basis. The exact API will
depend on the layer, but many layers (e.g. `Dense`, `Conv1D`, `Conv2D` and
`Conv3D`) have a unified API. These layers expose 3 keyword arguments:

  * `kernel_regularizer`: Regularizer to apply a penalty on the layer's kernel
  * `bias_regularizer`: Regularizer to apply a penalty on the layer's bias
  * `activity_regularizer`: Regularizer to apply a penalty on the layer's output

All layers (including custom layers) expose `activity_regularizer` as a
settable property, whether or not it is in the constructor arguments. The
value returned by the `activity_regularizer` is divided by the input batch
size so that the relative weighting between the weight regularizers and the
activity regularizers does not change with the batch size. You can access a
layer's regularization penalties by calling `layer.losses` after calling the
layer on inputs.

## Example

    
    layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(
        5, input_dim=5,
        kernel_initializer='ones',
        kernel_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.L1(0.01),
        activity_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.L2(0.01))
    tensor = tf.ones(shape=(5, 5)) * 2.0
    out = layer(tensor)
    
    
    # The kernel regularization term is 0.25
    # The activity regularization term (after dividing by the batch size) is 5
    tf.math.reduce_sum(layer.losses)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=5.25>
    
## Available penalties

    
    tf.keras.regularizers.L1(0.3)  # L1 Regularization Penalty
    tf.keras.regularizers.L2(0.1)  # L2 Regularization Penalty
    tf.keras.regularizers.L1L2(l1=0.01, l2=0.01)  # L1 + L2 penalties
    
## Directly calling a regularizer

Compute a regularization loss on a tensor by directly calling a regularizer as
if it is a one-argument function. E.g.

    
    >>> regularizer = tf.keras.regularizers.L2(2.)
    >>> tensor = tf.ones(shape=(5, 5))
    >>> regularizer(tensor)
    <tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=50.0>
    
## Developing new regularizers

Any function that takes in a weight matrix and returns a scalar tensor can be
used as a regularizer, e.g.:

    
    @tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable(package='Custom', name='l1')
    def l1_reg(weight_matrix):
       return 0.01 * tf.math.reduce_sum(tf.math.abs(weight_matrix))
    
    layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(5, input_dim=5,
        kernel_initializer='ones', kernel_regularizer=l1_reg)
    tensor = tf.ones(shape=(5, 5))
    out = layer(tensor)
    layer.losses
    [<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=0.25>]
    
Alternatively, you can write your custom regularizers in an object-oriented
way by extending this regularizer base class, e.g.:

    
    @tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable(package='Custom', name='l2')
    class L2Regularizer(tf.keras.regularizers.Regularizer):
      def __init__(self, l2=0.):
        self.l2 = l2
    
      def __call__(self, x):
        return self.l2 * tf.math.reduce_sum(tf.math.square(x))
    
      def get_config(self):
        return {'l2': float(self.l2)}
    
    layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(
      5, input_dim=5, kernel_initializer='ones',
      kernel_regularizer=L2Regularizer(l2=0.5))
    
    
    tensor = tf.ones(shape=(5, 5))
    out = layer(tensor)
    layer.losses
    [<tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=float32, numpy=12.5>]
    
### A note on serialization and deserialization:

Registering the regularizers as serializable is optional if you are just
training and executing models, exporting to and from SavedModels, or saving
and loading weight checkpoints. Registration is required for Keras
`model_to_estimator`, saving and loading models to HDF5 formats, Keras model
cloning, some visualization utilities, and exporting models to and from JSON.
If using this functionality, you must make sure any python process running
your model has also defined and registered your custom regularizer.
`tf.keras.utils.register_keras_serializable` is only available in TF 2.1 and
beyond. In earlier versions of TensorFlow you must pass your custom
regularizer to the `custom_objects` argument of methods that expect custom
regularizers to be registered as serializable.

## Methods

### `from_config`

View source

    
    @classmethod
    from_config(
        config
    )
    
Creates a regularizer from its config. This method is the reverse of `get_config`, capable of instantiating the same regularizer from the config dictionary. This method is used by Keras `model_to_estimator`, saving and loading models to HDF5 formats, Keras model cloning, some visualization utilities, and exporting models to and from JSON. | Arguments  
---  
`config` |  A Python dictionary, typically the output of get_config.   
Returns  
---  
A regularizer instance.  
### `get_config`

View source

    
    get_config()
    
Returns the config of the regularizer.

An regularizer config is a Python dictionary (serializable) containing all
configuration parameters of the regularizer. The same regularizer can be
reinstantiated later (without any saved state) from this configuration.

This method is optional if you are just training and executing models,
exporting to and from SavedModels, or using weight checkpoints.

This method is required for Keras `model_to_estimator`, saving and loading
models to HDF5 formats, Keras model cloning, some visualization utilities, and
exporting models to and from JSON.

Returns  
---  
Python dictionary.  
### `__call__`

View source

    
    __call__(
        x
    )
    
Compute a regularization penalty from an input tensor.
