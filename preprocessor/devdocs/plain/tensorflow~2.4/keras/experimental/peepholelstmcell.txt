    tf.keras.experimental.PeepholeLSTMCell(
        units, activation='tanh',
        recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', use_bias=True,
        kernel_initializer='glorot_uniform',
        recurrent_initializer='orthogonal',
        bias_initializer='zeros', unit_forget_bias=True,
        kernel_regularizer=None, recurrent_regularizer=None, bias_regularizer=None,

Peephole connections allow the gates to utilize the previous internal state as
well as the previous hidden state (which is what LSTMCell is limited to). This
allows PeepholeLSTMCell to better learn precise timings over LSTMCell. From
Gers et al., 2002: "We find that LSTM augmented by 'peephole connections' from
its internal cells to its multiplicative gates can learn the fine distinction
between sequences of spikes spaced either 50 or 49 time steps apart without
the help of any short training exemplars." The peephole implementation is
based on: Sak et al., 2014

#### Example:

    
    # Create 2 PeepholeLSTMCells
    peephole_lstm_cells = [PeepholeLSTMCell(size) for size in [128, 256]]
    # Create a layer composed sequentially of the peephole LSTM cells.
    layer = RNN(peephole_lstm_cells)
    input = keras.Input((timesteps, input_dim))
    output = layer(input)
    
## Methods

### `get_dropout_mask_for_cell`

View source

    
    get_dropout_mask_for_cell(
        inputs, training, count=1
    )
    
Get the dropout mask for RNN cell's input. It will create mask based on context if there isn't any existing cached mask. If a new mask is generated, it will update the cache in the cell. | Args  
---  
`inputs` |  The input tensor whose shape will be used to generate dropout mask.   
`training` |  Boolean tensor, whether its in training mode, dropout will be ignored in non-training mode.   
`count` |  Int, how many dropout mask will be generated. It is useful for cell that has internal weights fused together.   
Returns  
---  
List of mask tensor, generated or cached mask based on context.  
### `get_initial_state`

View source

    
    get_initial_state(
        inputs=None, batch_size=None, dtype=None
    )
    
### `get_recurrent_dropout_mask_for_cell`

View source

    
    get_recurrent_dropout_mask_for_cell(
        inputs, training, count=1
    )
    
Get the recurrent dropout mask for RNN cell.

It will create mask based on context if there isn't any existing cached mask.
If a new mask is generated, it will update the cache in the cell.

Args  
---  
`inputs` |  The input tensor whose shape will be used to generate dropout mask.   
`training` |  Boolean tensor, whether its in training mode, dropout will be ignored in non-training mode.   
`count` |  Int, how many dropout mask will be generated. It is useful for cell that has internal weights fused together.   
Returns  
---  
List of mask tensor, generated or cached mask based on context.  
### `reset_dropout_mask`

View source

    
    reset_dropout_mask()
    
Reset the cached dropout masks if any.

This is important for the RNN layer to invoke this in it `call()` method so
that the cached mask is cleared before calling the `cell.call()`. The mask
should be cached across the timestep within the same batch, but shouldn't be
cached between batches. Otherwise it will introduce unreasonable bias against
certain index of data within the batch.

### `reset_recurrent_dropout_mask`

View source

    
    reset_recurrent_dropout_mask()
    
Reset the cached recurrent dropout masks if any.

This is important for the RNN layer to invoke this in it call() method so that
the cached mask is cleared before calling the cell.call(). The mask should be
cached across the timestep within the same batch, but shouldn't be cached
between batches. Otherwise it will introduce unreasonable bias against certain
index of data within the batch.
