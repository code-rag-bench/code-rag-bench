        initial_learning_rate, decay_steps, alpha=0.0, name=None
    )
    
See [Loshchilov & Hutter, ICLR2016], SGDR: Stochastic Gradient Descent with
Warm Restarts. https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03983 When training a model, it is
often recommended to lower the learning rate as the training progresses. This
schedule applies a cosine decay function to an optimizer step, given a
provided initial learning rate. It requires a `step` value to compute the
decayed learning rate. You can just pass a TensorFlow variable that you
increment at each training step. The schedule a 1-arg callable that produces a
decayed learning rate when passed the current optimizer step. This can be
useful for changing the learning rate value across different invocations of
optimizer functions. It is computed as:

    
    def decayed_learning_rate(step):
      step = min(step, decay_steps)
      cosine_decay = 0.5 * (1 + cos(pi * step / decay_steps))
      decayed = (1 - alpha) * cosine_decay + alpha
      return initial_learning_rate * decayed
    
#### Example usage:

    
    decay_steps = 1000
    lr_decayed_fn = tf.keras.experimental.CosineDecay(
        initial_learning_rate, decay_steps)
    
You can pass this schedule directly into a `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` as the learning rate. The learning rate schedule is also serializable and deserializable using `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.serialize` and `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.deserialize`. | Returns  
---  
A 1-arg callable learning rate schedule that takes the current optimizer step
and outputs the decayed learning rate, a scalar `Tensor` of the same type as
`initial_learning_rate`.  
Args  
---  
`initial_learning_rate` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` Tensor or a Python number. The initial learning rate.   
`decay_steps` |  A scalar `int32` or `int64` `Tensor` or a Python number. Number of steps to decay over.   
`alpha` |  A scalar `float32` or `float64` Tensor or a Python number. Minimum learning rate value as a fraction of initial_learning_rate.   
`name` |  String. Optional name of the operation. Defaults to 'CosineDecay'.
