# Module: tf.keras.applications.mobilenet

MobileNet v1 models for Keras.

MobileNet is a general architecture and can be used for multiple use cases.
Depending on the use case, it can use different input layer size and different
width factors. This allows different width models to reduce the number of
multiply-adds and thereby reduce inference cost on mobile devices.

MobileNets support any input size greater than 32 x 32, with larger image
sizes offering better performance. The number of parameters and number of
multiply-adds can be modified by using the `alpha` parameter, which
increases/decreases the number of filters in each layer. By altering the image
size and `alpha` parameter, all 16 models from the paper can be built, with
ImageNet weights provided.

The paper demonstrates the performance of MobileNets using `alpha` values of
1.0 (also called 100 % MobileNet), 0.75, 0.5 and 0.25. For each of these
`alpha` values, weights for 4 different input image sizes are provided (224,
192, 160, 128).

The following table describes the size and accuracy of the 100% MobileNet

## on size 224 x 224:

## Width Multiplier (alpha) | ImageNet Acc | Multiply-Adds (M) | Params (M)
| 1.0 MobileNet-224 | 70.6 % | 529 | 4.2 | | 0.75 MobileNet-224 | 68.4 % | 325 | 2.6 | | 0.50 MobileNet-224 | 63.7 % | 149 | 1.3 |
## | 0.25 MobileNet-224 | 50.6 % | 41 | 0.5 |
The following table describes the performance of

## the 100 % MobileNet on various input sizes:

    
    Resolution      | ImageNet Acc | Multiply-Adds (M) | Params (M)
    
| 1.0 MobileNet-224 | 70.6 % | 529 | 4.2 | | 1.0 MobileNet-192 | 69.1 % | 529 | 4.2 | | 1.0 MobileNet-160 | 67.2 % | 529 | 4.2 |
## | 1.0 MobileNet-128 | 64.4 % | 529 | 4.2 |
