`tf.compat.v1.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer`

    
    tf.keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer(
        num_words=None,
        filters='!"#$%&()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\t\n',
        lower=True, split=' ', char_level=False, oov_token=None,
        document_count=0, **kwargs
    )
    
This class allows to vectorize a text corpus, by turning each text into either a sequence of integers (each integer being the index of a token in a dictionary) or into a vector where the coefficient for each token could be binary, based on word count, based on tf-idf... | Arguments  
---  
`num_words` |  the maximum number of words to keep, based on word frequency. Only the most common `num_words-1` words will be kept.   
`filters` |  a string where each element is a character that will be filtered from the texts. The default is all punctuation, plus tabs and line breaks, minus the `'` character.   
`lower` |  boolean. Whether to convert the texts to lowercase.   
`split` |  str. Separator for word splitting.   
`char_level` |  if True, every character will be treated as a token.   
`oov_token` |  if given, it will be added to word_index and used to replace out-of-vocabulary words during text_to_sequence calls   
By default, all punctuation is removed, turning the texts into space-separated
sequences of words (words maybe include the `'` character). These sequences
are then split into lists of tokens. They will then be indexed or vectorized.

`0` is a reserved index that won't be assigned to any word.

## Methods

### `fit_on_sequences`

View source

    
    fit_on_sequences(
        sequences
    )
    
Updates internal vocabulary based on a list of sequences.

Required before using `sequences_to_matrix` (if `fit_on_texts` was never
called).

Arguments  
---  
`sequences` |  A list of sequence. A "sequence" is a list of integer word indices.   
### `fit_on_texts`

View source

    
    fit_on_texts(
        texts
    )
    
Updates internal vocabulary based on a list of texts.

In the case where texts contains lists, we assume each entry of the lists to
be a token.

Required before using `texts_to_sequences` or `texts_to_matrix`.

Arguments  
---  
`texts` |  can be a list of strings, a generator of strings (for memory-efficiency), or a list of list of strings.   
### `get_config`

View source

    
    get_config()
    
Returns the tokenizer configuration as Python dictionary. The word count
dictionaries used by the tokenizer get serialized into plain JSON, so that the
configuration can be read by other projects.

Returns  
---  
A Python dictionary with the tokenizer configuration.  
### `sequences_to_matrix`

View source

    
    sequences_to_matrix(
        sequences, mode='binary'
    )
    
Converts a list of sequences into a Numpy matrix.

Arguments  
---  
`sequences` |  list of sequences (a sequence is a list of integer word indices).   
`mode` |  one of "binary", "count", "tfidf", "freq"   
Returns  
---  
A Numpy matrix.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  In case of invalid `mode` argument, or if the Tokenizer requires to be fit to sample data.   
### `sequences_to_texts`

View source

    
    sequences_to_texts(
        sequences
    )
    
Transforms each sequence into a list of text.

Only top `num_words-1` most frequent words will be taken into account. Only
words known by the tokenizer will be taken into account.

Arguments  
---  
`sequences` |  A list of sequences (list of integers).   
Returns  
---  
A list of texts (strings)  
### `sequences_to_texts_generator`

View source

    
    sequences_to_texts_generator(
        sequences
    )
    
Transforms each sequence in `sequences` to a list of texts(strings).

Each sequence has to a list of integers. In other words, sequences should be a
list of sequences

Only top `num_words-1` most frequent words will be taken into account. Only
words known by the tokenizer will be taken into account.

Arguments  
---  
`sequences` |  A list of sequences.   
Yields  
---  
Yields individual texts.  
### `texts_to_matrix`

View source

    
    texts_to_matrix(
        texts, mode='binary'
    )
    
Convert a list of texts to a Numpy matrix.

Arguments  
---  
`texts` |  list of strings.   
`mode` |  one of "binary", "count", "tfidf", "freq".   
Returns  
---  
A Numpy matrix.  
### `texts_to_sequences`

View source

    
    texts_to_sequences(
        texts
    )
    
Transforms each text in texts to a sequence of integers.

Only top `num_words-1` most frequent words will be taken into account. Only
words known by the tokenizer will be taken into account.

Arguments  
---  
`texts` |  A list of texts (strings).   
Returns  
---  
A list of sequences.  
### `texts_to_sequences_generator`

View source

    
    texts_to_sequences_generator(
        texts
    )
    
Transforms each text in `texts` to a sequence of integers.

Each item in texts can also be a list, in which case we assume each item of
that list to be a token.

Only top `num_words-1` most frequent words will be taken into account. Only
words known by the tokenizer will be taken into account.

Arguments  
---  
`texts` |  A list of texts (strings).   
Yields  
---  
Yields individual sequences.  
### `to_json`

View source

    
    to_json(
        **kwargs
    )
    
Returns a JSON string containing the tokenizer configuration. To load a
tokenizer from a JSON string, use
`keras.preprocessing.text.tokenizer_from_json(json_string)`.

Arguments  
---  
`**kwargs` |  Additional keyword arguments to be passed to `json.dumps()`.   
Returns  
---  
A JSON string containing the tokenizer configuration.
