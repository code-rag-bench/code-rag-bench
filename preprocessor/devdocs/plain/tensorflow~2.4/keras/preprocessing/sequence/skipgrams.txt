    tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.skipgrams(
        sequence, vocabulary_size, window_size=4, negative_samples=1.0, shuffle=True,
        categorical=False, sampling_table=None, seed=None
    )
    
This function transforms a sequence of word indexes (list of integers) into
tuples of words of the form:

  * (word, word in the same window), with label 1 (positive samples).
  * (word, random word from the vocabulary), with label 0 (negative samples).

---  
`sequence` |  A word sequence (sentence), encoded as a list of word indices (integers). If using a `sampling_table`, word indices are expected to match the rank of the words in a reference dataset (e.g. 10 would encode the 10-th most frequently occurring token). Note that index 0 is expected to be a non-word and will be skipped.   
`vocabulary_size` |  Int, maximum possible word index + 1   
`window_size` |  Int, size of sampling windows (technically half-window). The window of a word `w_i` will be `[i - window_size, i + window_size+1]`.   
`negative_samples` |  Float >= 0. 0 for no negative (i.e. random) samples. 1 for same number as positive samples.   
`shuffle` |  Whether to shuffle the word couples before returning them.   
`categorical` |  bool. if False, labels will be integers (eg. `[0, 1, 1 .. ]`), if `True`, labels will be categorical, e.g. `[[1,0],[0,1],[0,1] .. ]`.   
`sampling_table` |  1D array of size `vocabulary_size` where the entry i encodes the probability to sample a word of rank i.   
`seed` |  Random seed.   
Returns  
---  
couples, labels: where `couples` are int pairs and `labels` are either 0 or 1.  
#### Note:

By convention, index 0 in the vocabulary is a non-word and will be skipped.
