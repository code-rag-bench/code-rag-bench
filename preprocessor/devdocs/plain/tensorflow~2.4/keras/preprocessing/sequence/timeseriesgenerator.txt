`tf.compat.v1.keras.preprocessing.sequence.TimeseriesGenerator`

    
    tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.TimeseriesGenerator(
        data, targets, length, sampling_rate=1, stride=1, start_index=0, end_index=None,
        shuffle=False, reverse=False, batch_size=128
    )
    
This class takes in a sequence of data-points gathered at equal intervals,
along with time series parameters such as stride, length of history, etc., to
produce batches for training/validation. Arguments: data: Indexable generator
(such as list or Numpy array) containing consecutive data points (timesteps).
The data should be at 2D, and axis 0 is expected to be the time dimension.
targets: Targets corresponding to timesteps in `data`. It should have same
length as `data`. length: Length of the output sequences (in number of
timesteps). sampling_rate: Period between successive individual timesteps
within sequences. For rate `r`, timesteps `data[i]`, `data[i-r]`, ... `data[i
- length]` are used for create a sample sequence. stride: Period between
successive output sequences. For stride `s`, consecutive output samples would
be centered around `data[i]`, `data[i+s]`, `data[i+2*s]`, etc. start_index:
Data points earlier than `start_index` will not be used in the output
sequences. This is useful to reserve part of the data for test or validation.
end_index: Data points later than `end_index` will not be used in the output
sequences. This is useful to reserve part of the data for test or validation.
shuffle: Whether to shuffle output samples, or instead draw them in
chronological order. reverse: Boolean: if `true`, timesteps in each output
sample will be in reverse chronological order. batch_size: Number of
timeseries samples in each batch (except maybe the last one). Returns: A
Sequence instance. Examples:

    
    from keras.preprocessing.sequence import TimeseriesGenerator
    import numpy as np
    data = np.array([[i] for i in range(50)])
    targets = np.array([[i] for i in range(50)])
    data_gen = TimeseriesGenerator(data, targets,
                                   length=10, sampling_rate=2,
                                   batch_size=2)
    assert len(data_gen) == 20
    batch_0 = data_gen[0]
    x, y = batch_0
    assert np.array_equal(x,
                          np.array([[[0], [2], [4], [6], [8]],
                                    [[1], [3], [5], [7], [9]]]))
    assert np.array_equal(y,
                          np.array([[10], [11]]))
    
## Methods

### `get_config`

View source
