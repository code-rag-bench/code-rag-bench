# Module: tf.keras.callbacks

Callbacks: utilities called at certain points during model training.

## Modules

`experimental` module: Public API for tf.keras.callbacks.experimental
namespace.

## Classes

`class BaseLogger`: Callback that accumulates epoch averages of metrics.

`class CSVLogger`: Callback that streams epoch results to a CSV file.

`class Callback`: Abstract base class used to build new callbacks.

`class CallbackList`: Container abstracting a list of callbacks.

`class EarlyStopping`: Stop training when a monitored metric has stopped
improving.

`class History`: Callback that records events into a `History` object.

`class LambdaCallback`: Callback for creating simple, custom callbacks on-the-
fly.

`class LearningRateScheduler`: Learning rate scheduler.

`class ModelCheckpoint`: Callback to save the Keras model or model weights at
some frequency.

`class ProgbarLogger`: Callback that prints metrics to stdout.

`class ReduceLROnPlateau`: Reduce learning rate when a metric has stopped
improving.

`class RemoteMonitor`: Callback used to stream events to a server.

`class TensorBoard`: Enable visualizations for TensorBoard.

`class TerminateOnNaN`: Callback that terminates training when a NaN loss is
encountered.
