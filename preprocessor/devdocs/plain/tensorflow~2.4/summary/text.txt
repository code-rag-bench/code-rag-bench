| Arguments  
---

`data` |  A UTF-8 string tensor value.   
`step` |  Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted, this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.   
`description` |  Optional long-form description for this summary, as a constant `str`. Markdown is supported. Defaults to empty.   
Returns  
---  
True on success, or false if no summary was emitted because no default summary

Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()` is None.
