# tf.summary.audio

View source on GitHub  Write an audio summary.

    
    tf.summary.audio(
        name, data, sample_rate, step=None, max_outputs=3, encoding=None,
        description=None
    )
    
| Arguments  
---  
`name` |  A name for this summary. The summary tag used for TensorBoard will be this name prefixed by any active name scopes.   
`data` |  A `Tensor` representing audio data with shape `[k, t, c]`, where `k` is the number of audio clips, `t` is the number of frames, and `c` is the number of channels. Elements should be floating-point values in `[-1.0, 1.0]`. Any of the dimensions may be statically unknown (i.e., `None`).   
`sample_rate` |  An `int` or rank-0 `int32` `Tensor` that represents the sample rate, in Hz. Must be positive.   
`step` |  Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted, this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.   
`max_outputs` |  Optional `int` or rank-0 integer `Tensor`. At most this many audio clips will be emitted at each step. When more than `max_outputs` many clips are provided, the first `max_outputs` many clips will be used and the rest silently discarded.   
`encoding` |  Optional constant `str` for the desired encoding. Only "wav" is currently supported, but this is not guaranteed to remain the default, so if you want "wav" in particular, set this explicitly.   
`description` |  Optional long-form description for this summary, as a constant `str`. Markdown is supported. Defaults to empty.   
Returns  
---  
True on success, or false if no summary was emitted because no default summary
writer was available.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()` is None.
