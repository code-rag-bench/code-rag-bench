# tf.summary.experimental.write_raw_pb

Writes a summary using raw `tf.compat.v1.Summary` protocol buffers.

    
    tf.summary.experimental.write_raw_pb(
        tensor, step=None, name=None
    )
    
Experimental: this exists to support the usage of V1-style manual summary
writing (via the construction of a `tf.compat.v1.Summary` protocol buffer)
with the V2 summary writing API.

Args  
---  
`tensor` |  the string Tensor holding one or more serialized `Summary` protobufs   
`step` |  Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted, this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.   
`name` |  Optional string name for this op.   
Returns  
---  
True on success, or false if no summary was written because no default summary
writer was available.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()` is None.
