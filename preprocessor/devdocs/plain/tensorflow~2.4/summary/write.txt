# tf.summary.write

Writes a generic summary to the default SummaryWriter if one exists.

    
    tf.summary.write(
        tag, tensor, step=None, metadata=None, name=None
    )
    
This exists primarily to support the definition of type-specific summary ops
like scalar() and image(), and is not intended for direct use unless defining
a new type-specific summary op.

Args  
---  
`tag` |  string tag used to identify the summary (e.g. in TensorBoard), usually generated with `tf.summary.summary_scope`  
`tensor` |  the Tensor holding the summary data to write or a callable that returns this Tensor. If a callable is passed, it will only be called when a default SummaryWriter exists and the recording condition specified by `record_if()` is met.   
`step` |  Explicit `int64`-castable monotonic step value for this summary. If omitted, this defaults to `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()`, which must not be None.   
`metadata` |  Optional SummaryMetadata, as a proto or serialized bytes   
`name` |  Optional string name for this op.   
Returns  
---  
True on success, or false if no summary was written because no default summary
writer was available.  
Raises  
---  
`ValueError` |  if a default writer exists, but no step was provided and `tf.summary.experimental.get_step()` is None.
