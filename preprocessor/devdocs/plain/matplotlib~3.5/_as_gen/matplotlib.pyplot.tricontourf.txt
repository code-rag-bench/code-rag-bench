# matplotlib.pyplot.tricontourf

matplotlib.pyplot.tricontourf(*args, **kwargs)[source]

    
Draw contour regions on an unstructured triangular grid.

The triangulation can be specified in one of two ways; either

    
    tricontourf(triangulation, ...)
    
where triangulation is a `Triangulation` object, or

    
    tricontourf(x, y, ...)
    tricontourf(x, y, triangles, ...)
    tricontourf(x, y, triangles=triangles, ...)
    tricontourf(x, y, mask=mask, ...)
    tricontourf(x, y, triangles, mask=mask, ...)
    
in which case a `Triangulation` object will be created. See that class'
docstring for an explanation of these cases.

The remaining arguments may be:

    
    tricontourf(..., Z)
    
where Z is the array of values to contour, one per point in the triangulation.
The level values are chosen automatically.

    
    tricontourf(..., Z, levels)
    
contour up to levels+1 automatically chosen contour levels (levels intervals).

    
    tricontourf(..., Z, levels)
    
draw contour regions at the values specified in sequence levels, which must be
in increasing order.

    
    tricontourf(Z, **kwargs)
    
Use keyword arguments to control colors, linewidth, origin, cmap ... see below
for more details.

Parameters

    
triangulation`Triangulation`, optional

    
The unstructured triangular grid.

If specified, then x, y, triangles, and mask are not accepted.

x, yarray-like, optional

    
The coordinates of the values in Z.

triangles(ntri, 3) array-like of int, optional

    
For each triangle, the indices of the three points that make up the triangle,
ordered in an anticlockwise manner. If not specified, the Delaunay
triangulation is calculated.

mask(ntri,) array-like of bool, optional

    
Which triangles are masked out.

Z2D array-like

    
The height values over which the contour is drawn.

levelsint or array-like, optional

    
Determines the number and positions of the contour lines / regions.

If an int n, use `MaxNLocator`, which tries to automatically choose no more
than n+1 "nice" contour levels between vmin and vmax.

If array-like, draw contour lines at the specified levels. The values must be
in increasing order.

Returns

    
`TriContourSet`

Other Parameters

    
colorscolor string or sequence of colors, optional

    
The colors of the levels, i.e., the contour regions.

The sequence is cycled for the levels in ascending order. If the sequence is
shorter than the number of levels, it's repeated.

As a shortcut, single color strings may be used in place of one-element lists,
i.e. `'red'` instead of `['red']` to color all levels with the same color.
This shortcut does only work for color strings, not for other ways of
specifying colors.

By default (value None), the colormap specified by cmap will be used.

alphafloat, default: 1

    
The alpha blending value, between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque).

cmapstr or `Colormap`, default: `rcParams["image.cmap"]` (default:
`'viridis'`)

    
A `Colormap` instance or registered colormap name. The colormap maps the level
values to colors.

If both colors and cmap are given, an error is raised.

norm`Normalize`, optional

    
If a colormap is used, the `Normalize` instance scales the level values to the
canonical colormap range [0, 1] for mapping to colors. If not given, the
default linear scaling is used.

vmin, vmaxfloat, optional

    
If not None, either or both of these values will be supplied to the
`Normalize` instance, overriding the default color scaling based on levels.

origin{None, 'upper', 'lower', 'image'}, default: None

    
Determines the orientation and exact position of Z by specifying the position
of `Z[0, 0]`. This is only relevant, if X, Y are not given.

  * None: `Z[0, 0]` is at X=0, Y=0 in the lower left corner.
  * 'lower': `Z[0, 0]` is at X=0.5, Y=0.5 in the lower left corner.
  * 'upper': `Z[0, 0]` is at X=N+0.5, Y=0.5 in the upper left corner.
  * 'image': Use the value from `rcParams["image.origin"]` (default: `'upper'`).

extent(x0, x1, y0, y1), optional

    
If origin is not None, then extent is interpreted as in `imshow`: it gives the
outer pixel boundaries. In this case, the position of Z[0, 0] is the center of
the pixel, not a corner. If origin is None, then (x0, y0) is the position of
Z[0, 0], and (x1, y1) is the position of Z[-1, -1].

This argument is ignored if X and Y are specified in the call to contour.

locatorticker.Locator subclass, optional

    
The locator is used to determine the contour levels if they are not given
explicitly via levels. Defaults to `MaxNLocator`.

extend{'neither', 'both', 'min', 'max'}, default: 'neither'

    
Determines the `tricontourf`-coloring of values that are outside the levels
range.

If 'neither', values outside the levels range are not colored. If 'min', 'max'
or 'both', color the values below, above or below and above the levels range.

Values below `min(levels)` and above `max(levels)` are mapped to the
under/over values of the `Colormap`. Note that most colormaps do not have
dedicated colors for these by default, so that the over and under values are
the edge values of the colormap. You may want to set these values explicitly
using `Colormap.set_under` and `Colormap.set_over`.

Note

An existing `TriContourSet` does not get notified if properties of its
colormap are changed. Therefore, an explicit call to `ContourSet.changed()` is
needed after modifying the colormap. The explicit call can be left out, if a
colorbar is assigned to the `TriContourSet` because it internally calls
`ContourSet.changed()`.

xunits, yunitsregistered units, optional

    
Override axis units by specifying an instance of a
`matplotlib.units.ConversionInterface`.

antialiasedbool, optional

    
Enable antialiasing, overriding the defaults. For filled contours, the default
is True. For line contours, it is taken from `rcParams["lines.antialiased"]`
(default: `True`).

hatcheslist[str], optional

    
A list of cross hatch patterns to use on the filled areas. If None, no
hatching will be added to the contour. Hatching is supported in the
PostScript, PDF, SVG and Agg backends only.

#### Notes

`tricontourf` fills intervals that are closed at the top; that is, for
boundaries z1 and z2, the filled region is:

    
    z1 < Z <= z2
    
except for the lowest interval, which is closed on both sides (i.e. it
includes the lowest value).
