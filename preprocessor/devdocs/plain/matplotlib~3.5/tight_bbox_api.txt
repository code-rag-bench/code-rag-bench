# matplotlib.tight_bbox

Helper module for the bbox_inches parameter in `Figure.savefig`.

matplotlib.tight_bbox.adjust_bbox(fig, bbox_inches, fixed_dpi=None)[source]

    
Temporarily adjust the figure so that only the specified area (bbox_inches) is
saved.

It modifies fig.bbox, fig.bbox_inches, fig.transFigure._boxout, and fig.patch.
While the figure size changes, the scale of the original figure is conserved.
A function which restores the original values are returned.

matplotlib.tight_bbox.process_figure_for_rasterizing(fig, bbox_inches_restore,
fixed_dpi=None)[source]

    
A function that needs to be called when figure dpi changes during the drawing
(e.g., rasterizing). It recovers the bbox and re-adjust it with the new dpi.
