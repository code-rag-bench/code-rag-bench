#  pygame.freetype

    
Enhanced pygame module for loading and rendering computer fonts

The `pygame.freetype` module is a replacement for `pygame.font`. It has all of
the functionality of the original, plus many new features. Yet is has
absolutely no dependencies on the SDL_ttf library. It is implemented directly
on the FreeType 2 library. The `pygame.freetype` module is not itself backward
compatible with `pygame.font`. Instead, use the `pygame.ftfont` module as a
drop-in replacement for `pygame.font`.

All font file formats supported by FreeType can be rendered by
`pygame.freetype`, namely `TTF`, Type1, `CFF`, OpenType, `SFNT`, `PCF`, `FNT`,
`BDF`, `PFR` and Type42 fonts. All glyphs having UTF-32 code points are
accessible (see `Font.ucs4`).

Most work on fonts is done using `Font` instances. The module itself only has
routines for initialization and creation of `Font` objects. You can load fonts
from the system using the `SysFont()` function.

Extra support of bitmap fonts is available. Available bitmap sizes can be
listed (see `Font.get_sizes()`). For bitmap only fonts `Font` can set the size
for you (see the `Font.size` property).

For now undefined character codes are replaced with the `.notdef` (not
defined) character. How undefined codes are handled may become configurable in
a future release.

Pygame comes with a built-in default font. This can always be accessed by
passing None as the font name to the `Font` constructor.

Extra rendering features available to `pygame.freetype.Font` are direct to
surface rendering (see `Font.render_to()`), character kerning (see
`Font.kerning`), vertical layout (see `Font.vertical`), rotation of rendered
text (see `Font.rotation`), and the strong style (see `Font.strong`). Some
properties are configurable, such as strong style strength (see
`Font.strength`) and underline positioning (see `Font.underline_adjustment`).
Text can be positioned by the upper right corner of the text box or by the
text baseline (see `Font.origin`). Finally, a font's vertical and horizontal
size can be adjusted separately (see `Font.size`). The
`pygame.examples.freetype_misc` example shows these features in use.

The pygame package does not import `freetype` automatically when loaded. This
module must be imported explicitly to be used.

    
    import pygame
    import pygame.freetype
New in pygame 1.9.2: `freetype`

pygame.freetype.get_error()

    
Return the latest FreeType error

get_error() -> str

get_error() -> None

Return a description of the last error which occurred in the FreeType2
library, or `None` if no errors have occurred.

pygame.freetype.get_version()

    
Return the FreeType version

get_version() -> (int, int, int)

Returns the version of the FreeType library in use by this module.

Note that the `freetype` module depends on the FreeType 2 library. It will not
compile with the original FreeType 1.0. Hence, the first element of the tuple
will always be "2".

pygame.freetype.init()

    
Initialize the underlying FreeType library.

init(cache_size=64, resolution=72)

This function initializes the underlying FreeType library and must be called
before trying to use any of the functionality of the `freetype` module.

However, `pygame.init()` will automatically call this function if the
`freetype` module is already imported. It is safe to call this function more
than once.

Optionally, you may specify a default cache_size for the Glyph cache: the
maximum number of glyphs that will be cached at any given time by the module.
Exceedingly small values will be automatically tuned for performance. Also a
default pixel resolution, in dots per inch, can be given to adjust font
scaling.

pygame.freetype.quit()

    
Shut down the underlying FreeType library.

quit()

This function closes the `freetype` module. After calling this function, you
should not invoke any class, method or function related to the `freetype`
module as they are likely to fail or might give unpredictable results. It is
safe to call this function even if the module hasn't been initialized yet.

pygame.freetype.get_init()

    
Returns True if the FreeType module is currently initialized.

get_init() -> bool

Returns `True` if the `pygame.freetype` module is currently initialized.

New in pygame 1.9.5.

pygame.freetype.was_init()

    
DEPRECATED: Use get_init() instead.

was_init() -> bool

DEPRECATED: Returns `True` if the `pygame.freetype` module is currently
initialized. Use `get_init()` instead.

pygame.freetype.get_cache_size()

    
Return the glyph case size

get_cache_size() -> long

See `pygame.freetype.init()`.

pygame.freetype.get_default_resolution()

    
Return the default pixel size in dots per inch

get_default_resolution() -> long

Returns the default pixel size, in dots per inch, for the module. The default
is 72 DPI.

pygame.freetype.set_default_resolution()

    
Set the default pixel size in dots per inch for the module

set_default_resolution([resolution])

Set the default pixel size, in dots per inch, for the module. If the optional
argument is omitted or zero the resolution is reset to 72 DPI.

pygame.freetype.SysFont()

    
create a Font object from the system fonts

SysFont(name, size, bold=False, italic=False) -> Font

Return a new Font object that is loaded from the system fonts. The font will
match the requested bold and italic flags. Pygame uses a small set of common
font aliases. If the specific font you ask for is not available, a reasonable
alternative may be used. If a suitable system font is not found this will fall
back on loading the default pygame font.

The font name can also be an iterable of font names, a string of comma-
separated font names, or a bytes of comma-separated font names, in which case
the set of names will be searched in order.

New in pygame 2.0.1: Accept an iterable of font names.

pygame.freetype.get_default_font()

    
Get the filename of the default font

get_default_font() -> string

Return the filename of the default pygame font. This is not the full path to
the file. The file is usually in the same directory as the font module, but
can also be bundled in a separate archive.

pygame.freetype.Font

    
Create a new Font instance from a supported font file.

Font(file, size=0, font_index=0, resolution=0, ucs4=False) -> Font

Argument file can be either a string representing the font's filename, a file-
like object containing the font, or None; if None, a default, Pygame, font is
used.

Optionally, a size argument may be specified to set the default size in
points, which determines the size of the rendered characters. The size can
also be passed explicitly to each method call. Because of the way the caching
system works, specifying a default size on the constructor doesn't imply a
performance gain over manually passing the size on each function call. If the
font is bitmap and no size is given, the default size is set to the first
available size for the font.

If the font file has more than one font, the font to load can be chosen with
the index argument. An exception is raised for an out-of-range font index
value.

The optional resolution argument sets the pixel size, in dots per inch, for
use in scaling glyphs for this Font instance. If 0 then the default module
value, set by `init()`, is used. The Font object's resolution can only be
changed by re-initializing the Font instance.

The optional ucs4 argument, an integer, sets the default text translation
mode: 0 (False) recognize UTF-16 surrogate pairs, any other value (True), to
treat Unicode text as UCS-4, with no surrogate pairs. See `Font.ucs4`.

name

    
Proper font name.

name -> string

Read only. Returns the real (long) name of the font, as recorded in the font
file.

path

    
Font file path

path -> unicode

Read only. Returns the path of the loaded font file

size

    
The default point size used in rendering

size -> float

size -> (float, float)

Get or set the default size for text metrics and rendering. It can be a single
point size, given as a Python `int` or `float`, or a font ppem (width, height)
`tuple`. Size values are non-negative. A zero size or width represents an
undefined size. In this case the size must be given as a method argument, or
an exception is raised. A zero width but non-zero height is a ValueError.

For a scalable font, a single number value is equivalent to a tuple with width
equal height. A font can be stretched vertically with height set greater than
width, or horizontally with width set greater than height. For embedded
bitmaps, as listed by `get_sizes()`, use the nominal width and height to
select an available size.

Font size differs for a non-scalable, bitmap, font. During a method call it
must match one of the available sizes returned by method `get_sizes()`. If
not, an exception is raised. If the size is a single number, the size is first
matched against the point size value. If no match, then the available size
with the same nominal width and height is chosen.

get_rect()

    
Return the size and offset of rendered text

get_rect(text, style=STYLE_DEFAULT, rotation=0, size=0) -> rect

Gets the final dimensions and origin, in pixels, of text using the optional
size in points, style, and rotation. For other relevant render properties, and
for any optional argument not given, the default values set for the `Font`
instance are used.

Returns a `Rect` instance containing the width and height of the text's
bounding box and the position of the text's origin. The origin is useful in
aligning separately rendered pieces of text. It gives the baseline position
and bearing at the start of the text. See the `render_to()` method for an
example.

If text is a char (byte) string, its encoding is assumed to be `LATIN1`.

Optionally, text can be `None`, which will return the bounding rectangle for
the text passed to a previous `get_rect()`, `render()`, `render_to()`,
`render_raw()`, or `render_raw_to()` call. See `render_to()` for more details.

get_metrics()

    
Return the glyph metrics for the given text

get_metrics(text, size=0) -> [(...), ...]

Returns the glyph metrics for each character in text.

The glyph metrics are returned as a list of tuples. Each tuple gives metrics
of a single character glyph. The glyph metrics are:

    
    (min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, horizontal_advance_x, horizontal_advance_y)
The bounding box min_x, max_x, min_y, and max_y values are returned as grid-
fitted pixel coordinates of type int. The advance values are float values.

The calculations are done using the font's default size in points. Optionally
you may specify another point size with the size argument.

The metrics are adjusted for the current rotation, strong, and oblique
settings.

If text is a char (byte) string, then its encoding is assumed to be `LATIN1`.

height

    
The unscaled height of the font in font units

height -> int

Read only. Gets the height of the font. This is the average value of all
glyphs in the font.

ascender

    
The unscaled ascent of the font in font units

ascender -> int

Read only. Return the number of units from the font's baseline to the top of
the bounding box.

descender

    
The unscaled descent of the font in font units

descender -> int

Read only. Return the height in font units for the font descent. The descent
is the number of units from the font's baseline to the bottom of the bounding
box.

get_sized_ascender()

    
The scaled ascent of the font in pixels

get_sized_ascender(<size>=0) -> int

Return the number of units from the font's baseline to the top of the bounding
box. It is not adjusted for strong or rotation.

get_sized_descender()

    
The scaled descent of the font in pixels

get_sized_descender(<size>=0) -> int

Return the number of pixels from the font's baseline to the top of the
bounding box. It is not adjusted for strong or rotation.

get_sized_height()

    
The scaled height of the font in pixels

get_sized_height(<size>=0) -> int

Returns the height of the font. This is the average value of all glyphs in the
font. It is not adjusted for strong or rotation.

get_sized_glyph_height()

    
The scaled bounding box height of the font in pixels

get_sized_glyph_height(<size>=0) -> int

Return the glyph bounding box height of the font in pixels. This is the
average value of all glyphs in the font. It is not adjusted for strong or
rotation.

get_sizes()

    
return the available sizes of embedded bitmaps

get_sizes() -> [(int, int, int, float, float), ...]

get_sizes() -> []

Returns a list of tuple records, one for each point size supported. Each tuple
containing the point size, the height in pixels, width in pixels, horizontal
ppem (nominal width) in fractional pixels, and vertical ppem (nominal height)
in fractional pixels.

render()

    
Return rendered text as a surface

render(text, fgcolor=None, bgcolor=None, style=STYLE_DEFAULT, rotation=0,
size=0) -> (Surface, Rect)

Returns a new `Surface`, with the text rendered to it in the color given by
'fgcolor'. If no foreground color is given, the default foreground color,
`fgcolor` is used. If `bgcolor` is given, the surface will be filled with this
color. When no background color is given, the surface background is
transparent, zero alpha. Normally the returned surface has a 32 bit pixel
size. However, if `bgcolor` is `None` and anti-aliasing is disabled a
monochrome 8 bit colorkey surface, with colorkey set for the background color,
is returned.

The return value is a tuple: the new surface and the bounding rectangle giving
the size and origin of the rendered text.

If an empty string is passed for text then the returned Rect is zero width and
the height of the font.

Optional fgcolor, style, rotation, and size arguments override the default
values set for the `Font` instance.

If text is a char (byte) string, then its encoding is assumed to be `LATIN1`.

Optionally, text can be `None`, which will render the text passed to a
previous `get_rect()`, `render()`, `render_to()`, `render_raw()`, or
`render_raw_to()` call. See `render_to()` for details.

render_to()

    
Render text onto an existing surface

render_to(surf, dest, text, fgcolor=None, bgcolor=None, style=STYLE_DEFAULT,
rotation=0, size=0) -> Rect

Renders the string text to the `pygame.Surface` surf, at position dest, a (x,
y) surface coordinate pair. If either x or y is not an integer it is converted
to one if possible. Any sequence where the first two items are x and y
positional elements is accepted, including a `Rect` instance. As with
`render()`, optional fgcolor, style, rotation, and size argument are
available.

If a background color bgcolor is given, the text bounding box is first filled
with that color. The text is blitted next. Both the background fill and text
rendering involve full alpha blits. That is, the alpha values of the
foreground, background, and destination target surface all affect the blit.

The return value is a rectangle giving the size and position of the rendered
text within the surface.

If an empty string is passed for text then the returned `Rect` is zero width
and the height of the font. The rect will test False.

Optionally, text can be set `None`, which will re-render text passed to a
previous `render_to()`, `get_rect()`, `render()`, `render_raw()`, or
`render_raw_to()` call. Primarily, this feature is an aid to using
`render_to()` in combination with `get_rect()`. An example:

    
    def word_wrap(surf, text, font, color=(0, 0, 0)):
        font.origin = True
        words = text.split(' ')
        width, height = surf.get_size()
        line_spacing = font.get_sized_height() + 2
        x, y = 0, line_spacing
        space = font.get_rect(' ')
        for word in words:
            bounds = font.get_rect(word)
            if x + bounds.width + bounds.x >= width:
                x, y = 0, y + line_spacing
            if x + bounds.width + bounds.x >= width:
                raise ValueError("word too wide for the surface")
            if y + bounds.height - bounds.y >= height:
                raise ValueError("text to long for the surface")
            font.render_to(surf, (x, y), None, color)
            x += bounds.width + space.width
        return x, y
When `render_to()` is called with the same font properties ― `size`, `style`,
`strength`, `wide`, `antialiased`, `vertical`, `rotation`, `kerning`, and
`use_bitmap_strikes` ― as `get_rect()`, `render_to()` will use the layout
calculated by `get_rect()`. Otherwise, `render_to()` will recalculate the
layout if called with a text string or one of the above properties has changed
after the `get_rect()` call.

If text is a char (byte) string, then its encoding is assumed to be `LATIN1`.

render_raw()

    
Return rendered text as a string of bytes

render_raw(text, style=STYLE_DEFAULT, rotation=0, size=0, invert=False) ->
(bytes, (int, int))

Like `render()` but with the pixels returned as a byte string of 8-bit gray-
scale values. The foreground color is 255, the background 0, useful as an
alpha mask for a foreground pattern.

render_raw_to()

    
Render text into an array of ints

render_raw_to(array, text, dest=None, style=STYLE_DEFAULT, rotation=0, size=0,
invert=False) -> Rect

Render to an array object exposing an array struct interface. The array must
be two dimensional with integer items. The default dest value, `None`, is
equivalent to position (0, 0). See `render_to()`. As with the other render
methods, text can be `None` to render a text string passed previously to
another method.

The return value is a `pygame.Rect()` giving the size and position of the
rendered text.

style

    
The font's style flags

style -> int

Gets or sets the default style of the Font. This default style will be used
for all text rendering and size calculations unless overridden specifically a
render or `get_rect()` call. The style value may be a bit-wise OR of one or
more of the following constants:

    
    STYLE_NORMAL
    STYLE_UNDERLINE
    STYLE_OBLIQUE
    STYLE_STRONG
    STYLE_WIDE
    STYLE_DEFAULT
These constants may be found on the FreeType constants module. Optionally, the
default style can be modified or obtained accessing the individual style
attributes (underline, oblique, strong).

The `STYLE_OBLIQUE` and `STYLE_STRONG` styles are for scalable fonts only. An
attempt to set either for a bitmap font raises an AttributeError. An attempt
to set either for an inactive font, as returned by `Font.__new__()`, raises a
RuntimeError.

Assigning `STYLE_DEFAULT` to the `style` property leaves the property
unchanged, as this property defines the default. The `style` property will
never return `STYLE_DEFAULT`.

underline

    
The state of the font's underline style flag

underline -> bool

Gets or sets whether the font will be underlined when drawing text. This
default style value will be used for all text rendering and size calculations
unless overridden specifically in a render or `get_rect()` call, via the
'style' parameter.

strong

    
The state of the font's strong style flag

strong -> bool

Gets or sets whether the font will be bold when drawing text. This default
style value will be used for all text rendering and size calculations unless
overridden specifically in a render or `get_rect()` call, via the 'style'
parameter.

oblique

    
The state of the font's oblique style flag

oblique -> bool

Gets or sets whether the font will be rendered as oblique. This default style
value will be used for all text rendering and size calculations unless
overridden specifically in a render or `get_rect()` call, via the style
parameter.

The oblique style is only supported for scalable (outline) fonts. An attempt
to set this style on a bitmap font will raise an AttributeError. If the font
object is inactive, as returned by `Font.__new__()`, setting this property
raises a RuntimeError.

wide

    
The state of the font's wide style flag

wide -> bool

Gets or sets whether the font will be stretched horizontally when drawing
text. It produces a result similar to `pygame.font.Font`'s bold. This style
not available for rotated text.

strength

    
The strength associated with the strong or wide font styles

strength -> float

The amount by which a font glyph's size is enlarged for the strong or wide
transformations, as a fraction of the untransformed size. For the wide style
only the horizontal dimension is increased. For strong text both the
horizontal and vertical dimensions are enlarged. A wide style of strength
0.08333 ( 1/12 ) is equivalent to the `pygame.font.Font` bold style. The
default is 0.02778 ( 1/36 ).

The strength style is only supported for scalable (outline) fonts. An attempt
to set this property on a bitmap font will raise an AttributeError. If the
font object is inactive, as returned by `Font.__new__()`, assignment to this
property raises a RuntimeError.

underline_adjustment

    
Adjustment factor for the underline position

underline_adjustment -> float

Gets or sets a factor which, when positive, is multiplied with the font's
underline offset to adjust the underline position. A negative value turns an
underline into a strike-through or overline. It is multiplied with the
ascender. Accepted values range between -2.0 and 2.0 inclusive. A value of 0.5
closely matches Tango underlining. A value of 1.0 mimics `pygame.font.Font`
underlining.

fixed_width

    
Gets whether the font is fixed-width

fixed_width -> bool

Read only. Returns `True` if the font contains fixed-width characters (for
example Courier, Bitstream Vera Sans Mono, Andale Mono).

fixed_sizes

    
the number of available bitmap sizes for the font

fixed_sizes -> int

Read only. Returns the number of point sizes for which the font contains
bitmap character images. If zero then the font is not a bitmap font. A
scalable font may contain pre-rendered point sizes as strikes.

scalable

    
Gets whether the font is scalable

scalable -> bool

Read only. Returns `True` if the font contains outline glyphs. If so, the
point size is not limited to available bitmap sizes.

use_bitmap_strikes

    
allow the use of embedded bitmaps in an outline font file

use_bitmap_strikes -> bool

Some scalable fonts include embedded bitmaps for particular point sizes. This
property controls whether or not those bitmap strikes are used. Set it `False`
to disable the loading of any bitmap strike. Set it `True`, the default, to
permit bitmap strikes for a non-rotated render with no style other than `wide`
or `underline`. This property is ignored for bitmap fonts.

See also `fixed_sizes` and `get_sizes()`.

antialiased

    
Font anti-aliasing mode

antialiased -> bool

Gets or sets the font's anti-aliasing mode. This defaults to `True` on all
fonts, which are rendered with full 8 bit blending.

Set to `False` to do monochrome rendering. This should provide a small speed
gain and reduce cache memory size.

kerning

    
Character kerning mode

kerning -> bool

Gets or sets the font's kerning mode. This defaults to `False` on all fonts,
which will be rendered without kerning.

Set to `True` to add kerning between character pairs, if supported by the
font, when positioning glyphs.

vertical

    
Font vertical mode

vertical -> bool

Gets or sets whether the characters are laid out vertically rather than
horizontally. May be useful when rendering Kanji or some other vertical
script.

Set to `True` to switch to a vertical text layout. The default is `False`,
place horizontally.

Note that the `Font` class does not automatically determine script
orientation. Vertical layout must be selected explicitly.

Also note that several font formats (especially bitmap based ones) don't
contain the necessary metrics to draw glyphs vertically, so drawing in those
cases will give unspecified results.

rotation

    
text rotation in degrees counterclockwise

rotation -> int

Gets or sets the baseline angle of the rendered text. The angle is represented
as integer degrees. The default angle is 0, with horizontal text rendered
along the X-axis, and vertical text along the Y-axis. A positive value rotates
these axes counterclockwise that many degrees. A negative angle corresponds to
a clockwise rotation. The rotation value is normalized to a value within the
range 0 to 359 inclusive (eg. 390 -> 390 - 360 -> 30, -45 -> 360 + -45 -> 315,
720 -> 720 - (2 * 360) -> 0).

Only scalable (outline) fonts can be rotated. An attempt to change the
rotation of a bitmap font raises an AttributeError. An attempt to change the
rotation of an inactive font instance, as returned by `Font.__new__()`, raises
a RuntimeError.

fgcolor

    
default foreground color

fgcolor -> Color

Gets or sets the default glyph rendering color. It is initially opaque black ―
(0, 0, 0, 255). Applies to `render()` and `render_to()`.

bgcolor

    
default background color

bgcolor -> Color

Gets or sets the default background rendering color. Initially it is unset and
text will render with a transparent background by default. Applies to
`render()` and `render_to()`.

New in pygame 2.0.0.

origin

    
Font render to text origin mode

origin -> bool

If set `True`, `render_to()` and `render_raw_to()` will take the dest position
to be that of the text origin, as opposed to the top-left corner of the
bounding box. See `get_rect()` for details.

pad

    
padded boundary mode

pad -> bool

If set `True`, then the text boundary rectangle will be inflated to match that
of `font.Font`. Otherwise, the boundary rectangle is just large enough for the
text.

ucs4

    
Enable UCS-4 mode

ucs4 -> bool

Gets or sets the decoding of Unicode text. By default, the freetype module
performs UTF-16 surrogate pair decoding on Unicode text. This allows 32-bit
escape sequences ('Uxxxxxxxx') between 0x10000 and 0x10FFFF to represent their
corresponding UTF-32 code points on Python interpreters built with a UCS-2
Unicode type (on Windows, for instance). It also means character values within
the UTF-16 surrogate area (0xD800 to 0xDFFF) are considered part of a
surrogate pair. A malformed surrogate pair will raise a UnicodeEncodeError.
Setting ucs4 `True` turns surrogate pair decoding off, allowing access the
full UCS-4 character range to a Python interpreter built with four-byte
Unicode character support.

resolution

    
Pixel resolution in dots per inch

resolution -> int

Read only. Gets pixel size used in scaling font glyphs for this `Font`
instance.
