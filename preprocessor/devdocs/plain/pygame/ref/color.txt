#  pygame.Color

    
pygame object for color representations

Color(r, g, b) -> Color

Color(r, g, b, a=255) -> Color

Color(color_value) -> Color

The `Color` class represents `RGBA` color values using a value range of 0 to
255 inclusive. It allows basic arithmetic operations — binary operations `+`,
`-`, `*`, `//`, `%`, and unary operation `~` — to create new colors, supports
conversions to other color spaces such as `HSV` or `HSL` and lets you adjust
single color channels. Alpha defaults to 255 (fully opaque) when not given.
The arithmetic operations and `correct_gamma()` method preserve subclasses.
For the binary operators, the class of the returned color is that of the left
hand color object of the operator.

Color objects support equality comparison with other color objects and 3 or 4
element tuples of integers. There was a bug in pygame 1.8.1 where the default
alpha was 0, not 255 like previously.

Color objects export the C level array interface. The interface exports a
read-only one dimensional unsigned byte array of the same assigned length as
the color. For CPython 2.6 and later, the new buffer interface is also
exported, with the same characteristics as the array interface.

The floor division, `//`, and modulus, `%`, operators do not raise an
exception for division by zero. Instead, if a color, or alpha, channel in the
right hand color is 0, then the result is 0. For example:

    
    # These expressions are True
    Color(255, 255, 255, 255) // Color(0, 64, 64, 64) == Color(0, 3, 3, 3)
    Color(255, 255, 255, 255) % Color(64, 64, 64, 0) == Color(63, 63, 63, 0)
Parameters: | 
  * r (int) -- red value in the range of 0 to 255 inclusive
  * g (int) -- green value in the range of 0 to 255 inclusive
  * b (int) -- blue value in the range of 0 to 255 inclusive
  * a (int) -- (optional) alpha value in the range of 0 to 255 inclusive, default is 255
  * color_value (Color or str or int or tuple(int, int, int, [int]) or list(int, int, int, [int])) -- color value (see note below for the supported formats) Note
Supported color_value formats:

     \- Color object: clones the given `Color` object \- color name str: name of the color to use, e.g. `'red'` (all the supported name strings can be found in the colordict module) \- HTML color format str: `'#rrggbbaa'` or `'#rrggbb'`, where rr, gg, bb, and aa are 2-digit hex numbers in the range of 0 to 0xFF inclusive, the aa (alpha) value defaults to 0xFF if not provided \- hex number str: `'0xrrggbbaa'` or `'0xrrggbb'`, where rr, gg, bb, and aa are 2-digit hex numbers in the range of 0x00 to 0xFF inclusive, the aa (alpha) value defaults to 0xFF if not provided \- int: int value of the color to use, using hex numbers can make this parameter more readable, e.g. `0xrrggbbaa`, where rr, gg, bb, and aa are 2-digit hex numbers in the range of 0x00 to 0xFF inclusive, note that the aa (alpha) value is not optional for the int format and must be provided \- tuple/list of int color values: `(R, G, B, A)` or `(R, G, B)`, where R, G, B, and A are int values in the range of 0 to 255 inclusive, the A (alpha) value defaults to 255 if not provided

Returns: |  a newly created `Color` object

Changed in pygame 2.0.0: Support for tuples, lists, and `Color` objects when
creating `Color` objects.

Changed in pygame 1.9.2: Color objects export the C level array interface.

Changed in pygame 1.9.0: Color objects support 4-element tuples of integers.

Changed in pygame 1.8.1: New implementation of the class.

r

    
Gets or sets the red value of the Color.

r -> int

The red value of the Color.

g

    
Gets or sets the green value of the Color.

g -> int

The green value of the Color.

b

    
Gets or sets the blue value of the Color.

b -> int

The blue value of the Color.

a

    
Gets or sets the alpha value of the Color.

a -> int

The alpha value of the Color.

cmy

    
Gets or sets the CMY representation of the Color.

cmy -> tuple

The `CMY` representation of the Color. The `CMY` components are in the ranges
`C` = [0, 1], `M` = [0, 1], `Y` = [0, 1]. Note that this will not return the
absolutely exact `CMY` values for the set `RGB` values in all cases. Due to
the `RGB` mapping from 0-255 and the `CMY` mapping from 0-1 rounding errors
may cause the `CMY` values to differ slightly from what you might expect.

hsva

    
Gets or sets the HSVA representation of the Color.

hsva -> tuple

The `HSVA` representation of the Color. The `HSVA` components are in the
ranges `H` = [0, 360], `S` = [0, 100], `V` = [0, 100], A = [0, 100]. Note that
this will not return the absolutely exact `HSV` values for the set `RGB`
values in all cases. Due to the `RGB` mapping from 0-255 and the `HSV` mapping
from 0-100 and 0-360 rounding errors may cause the `HSV` values to differ
slightly from what you might expect.

hsla

    
Gets or sets the HSLA representation of the Color.

hsla -> tuple

The `HSLA` representation of the Color. The `HSLA` components are in the
ranges `H` = [0, 360], `S` = [0, 100], `V` = [0, 100], A = [0, 100]. Note that
this will not return the absolutely exact `HSL` values for the set `RGB`
values in all cases. Due to the `RGB` mapping from 0-255 and the `HSL` mapping
from 0-100 and 0-360 rounding errors may cause the `HSL` values to differ
slightly from what you might expect.

i1i2i3

    
Gets or sets the I1I2I3 representation of the Color.

i1i2i3 -> tuple

The `I1I2I3` representation of the Color. The `I1I2I3` components are in the
ranges `I1` = [0, 1], `I2` = [-0.5, 0.5], `I3` = [-0.5, 0.5]. Note that this
will not return the absolutely exact `I1I2I3` values for the set `RGB` values
in all cases. Due to the `RGB` mapping from 0-255 and the `I1I2I3` mapping
from 0-1 rounding errors may cause the `I1I2I3` values to differ slightly from
what you might expect.

normalize()

    
Returns the normalized RGBA values of the Color.

normalize() -> tuple

Returns the normalized `RGBA` values of the Color as floating point values.

correct_gamma()

    
Applies a certain gamma value to the Color.

correct_gamma (gamma) -> Color

Applies a certain gamma value to the Color and returns a new Color with the
adjusted `RGBA` values.

set_length()

    
Set the number of elements in the Color to 1,2,3, or 4.

set_length(len) -> None

The default Color length is 4. Colors can have lengths 1,2,3 or 4. This is
useful if you want to unpack to r,g,b and not r,g,b,a. If you want to get the
length of a Color do `len(acolor)`.

New in pygame 1.9.0.

lerp()

    
returns a linear interpolation to the given Color.

lerp(Color, float) -> Color

Returns a Color which is a linear interpolation between self and the given
Color in RGBA space. The second parameter determines how far between self and
other the result is going to be. It must be a value between 0 and 1 where 0
means self and 1 means other will be returned.

New in pygame 2.0.1.

premul_alpha()

    
returns a Color where the r,g,b components have been multiplied by the alpha.

premul_alpha() -> Color

Returns a new Color where each of the red, green and blue colour channels have
been multiplied by the alpha channel of the original color. The alpha channel
remains unchanged.

This is useful when working with the `BLEND_PREMULTIPLIED` blending mode flag
for `pygame.Surface.blit()`, which assumes that all surfaces using it are
using pre-multiplied alpha colors.

New in pygame 2.0.0.

update()

    
Sets the elements of the color

update(r, g, b) -> None

update(r, g, b, a=255) -> None

update(color_value) -> None

Sets the elements of the color. See parameters for `pygame.Color()` for the
parameters of this function. If the alpha value was not set it will not
change.

New in pygame 2.0.1.
