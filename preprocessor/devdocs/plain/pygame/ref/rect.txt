#  pygame.Rect

    
pygame object for storing rectangular coordinates

Rect(left, top, width, height) -> Rect

Rect((left, top), (width, height)) -> Rect

Rect(object) -> Rect

Pygame uses Rect objects to store and manipulate rectangular areas. A Rect can
be created from a combination of left, top, width, and height values. Rects
can also be created from python objects that are already a Rect or have an
attribute named "rect".

Any pygame function that requires a Rect argument also accepts any of these
values to construct a Rect. This makes it easier to create Rects on the fly as
arguments to functions.

The Rect functions that change the position or size of a Rect return a new
copy of the Rect with the affected changes. The original Rect is not modified.
Some methods have an alternate "in-place" version that returns None but
affects the original Rect. These "in-place" methods are denoted with the "ip"
suffix.

The Rect object has several virtual attributes which can be used to move and
align the Rect:

    
    x,y
    top, left, bottom, right
    topleft, bottomleft, topright, bottomright
    midtop, midleft, midbottom, midright
    center, centerx, centery
    size, width, height
    w,h
All of these attributes can be assigned to:

    
    rect1.right = 10
    rect2.center = (20,30)
Assigning to size, width or height changes the dimensions of the rectangle;
all other assignments move the rectangle without resizing it. Notice that some
attributes are integers and others are pairs of integers.

If a Rect has a nonzero width or height, it will return `True` for a nonzero
test. Some methods return a Rect with 0 size to represent an invalid
rectangle. A Rect with a 0 size will not collide when using collision
detection methods (e.g. `collidepoint()`, `colliderect()`, etc.).

The coordinates for Rect objects are all integers. The size values can be
programmed to have negative values, but these are considered illegal Rects for
most operations.

There are several collision tests between other rectangles. Most python
containers can be searched for collisions against a single Rect.

The area covered by a Rect does not include the right- and bottom-most edge of
pixels. If one Rect's bottom border is another Rect's top border (i.e.,
rect1.bottom=rect2.top), the two meet exactly on the screen but do not
overlap, and `rect1.colliderect(rect2)` returns false.

New in pygame 1.9.2: The Rect class can be subclassed. Methods such as
`copy()` and `move()` will recognize this and return instances of the
subclass. However, the subclass's `__init__()` method is not called, and
`__new__()` is assumed to take no arguments. So these methods should be
overridden if any extra attributes need to be copied.

copy()

    
copy the rectangle

copy() -> Rect

Returns a new rectangle having the same position and size as the original.

New in pygame 1.9

move()

    
moves the rectangle

move(x, y) -> Rect

Returns a new rectangle that is moved by the given offset. The x and y
arguments can be any integer value, positive or negative.

move_ip()

    
moves the rectangle, in place

move_ip(x, y) -> None

Same as the `Rect.move()` method, but operates in place.

inflate()

    
grow or shrink the rectangle size

inflate(x, y) -> Rect

Returns a new rectangle with the size changed by the given offset. The
rectangle remains centered around its current center. Negative values will
shrink the rectangle. Note, uses integers, if the offset given is too small(<
2 > -2), center will be off.

inflate_ip()

    
grow or shrink the rectangle size, in place

inflate_ip(x, y) -> None

Same as the `Rect.inflate()` method, but operates in place.

update()

    
sets the position and size of the rectangle

update(left, top, width, height) -> None

update((left, top), (width, height)) -> None

update(object) -> None

Sets the position and size of the rectangle, in place. See parameters for
`pygame.Rect()` for the parameters of this function.

New in pygame 2.0.1.

clamp()

    
moves the rectangle inside another

clamp(Rect) -> Rect

Returns a new rectangle that is moved to be completely inside the argument
Rect. If the rectangle is too large to fit inside, it is centered inside the
argument Rect, but its size is not changed.

clamp_ip()

    
moves the rectangle inside another, in place

clamp_ip(Rect) -> None

Same as the `Rect.clamp()` method, but operates in place.

clip()

    
crops a rectangle inside another

clip(Rect) -> Rect

Returns a new rectangle that is cropped to be completely inside the argument
Rect. If the two rectangles do not overlap to begin with, a Rect with 0 size
is returned.

clipline()

    
crops a line inside a rectangle

clipline(x1, y1, x2, y2) -> ((cx1, cy1), (cx2, cy2))

clipline(x1, y1, x2, y2) -> ()

clipline((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) -> ((cx1, cy1), (cx2, cy2))

clipline((x1, y1), (x2, y2)) -> ()

clipline((x1, y1, x2, y2)) -> ((cx1, cy1), (cx2, cy2))

clipline((x1, y1, x2, y2)) -> ()

clipline(((x1, y1), (x2, y2))) -> ((cx1, cy1), (cx2, cy2))

clipline(((x1, y1), (x2, y2))) -> ()

Returns the coordinates of a line that is cropped to be completely inside the
rectangle. If the line does not overlap the rectangle, then an empty tuple is
returned.

The line to crop can be any of the following formats (floats can be used in
place of ints, but they will be truncated):

>   * four ints
>   * 2 lists/tuples/Vector2s of 2 ints
>   * a list/tuple of four ints
>   * a list/tuple of 2 lists/tuples/Vector2s of 2 ints
>

Returns: | a tuple with the coordinates of the given line cropped to be completely inside the rectangle is returned, if the given line does not overlap the rectangle, an empty tuple is returned  
---|---  
Return type: | tuple(tuple(int, int), tuple(int, int)) or ()  
Raises: |  TypeError \-- if the line coordinates are not given as one of the above described line formats  
Note

This method can be used for collision detection between a rect and a line. See
example code below.

Note

The `rect.bottom` and `rect.right` attributes of a `pygame.Rect` always lie
one pixel outside of its actual border.

    
    # Example using clipline().
    clipped_line = rect.clipline(line)
    
    if clipped_line:
        # If clipped_line is not an empty tuple then the line
        # collides/overlaps with the rect. The returned value contains
        # the endpoints of the clipped line.
        start, end = clipped_line
        x1, y1 = start
        x2, y2 = end
    else:
        print("No clipping. The line is fully outside the rect.")
New in pygame 2.0.0.

union()

    
joins two rectangles into one

union(Rect) -> Rect

Returns a new rectangle that completely covers the area of the two provided
rectangles. There may be area inside the new Rect that is not covered by the
originals.

union_ip()

    
joins two rectangles into one, in place

union_ip(Rect) -> None

Same as the `Rect.union()` method, but operates in place.

unionall()

    
the union of many rectangles

unionall(Rect_sequence) -> Rect

Returns the union of one rectangle with a sequence of many rectangles.

unionall_ip()

    
the union of many rectangles, in place

unionall_ip(Rect_sequence) -> None

The same as the `Rect.unionall()` method, but operates in place.

fit()

    
resize and move a rectangle with aspect ratio

fit(Rect) -> Rect

Returns a new rectangle that is moved and resized to fit another. The aspect
ratio of the original Rect is preserved, so the new rectangle may be smaller
than the target in either width or height.

normalize()

    
correct negative sizes

normalize() -> None

This will flip the width or height of a rectangle if it has a negative size.
The rectangle will remain in the same place, with only the sides swapped.

contains()

    
test if one rectangle is inside another

contains(Rect) -> bool

Returns true when the argument is completely inside the Rect.

collidepoint()

    
test if a point is inside a rectangle

collidepoint(x, y) -> bool

collidepoint((x,y)) -> bool

Returns true if the given point is inside the rectangle. A point along the
right or bottom edge is not considered to be inside the rectangle.

Note

For collision detection between a rect and a line the `clipline()` method can
be used.

colliderect()

    
test if two rectangles overlap

colliderect(Rect) -> bool

Returns true if any portion of either rectangle overlap (except the top+bottom
or left+right edges).

Note

For collision detection between a rect and a line the `clipline()` method can
be used.

collidelist()

    
test if one rectangle in a list intersects

collidelist(list) -> index

Test whether the rectangle collides with any in a sequence of rectangles. The
index of the first collision found is returned. If no collisions are found an
index of -1 is returned.

collidelistall()

    
test if all rectangles in a list intersect

collidelistall(list) -> indices

Returns a list of all the indices that contain rectangles that collide with
the Rect. If no intersecting rectangles are found, an empty list is returned.

collidedict()

    
test if one rectangle in a dictionary intersects

collidedict(dict) -> (key, value)

collidedict(dict) -> None

collidedict(dict, use_values=0) -> (key, value)

collidedict(dict, use_values=0) -> None

Returns the first key and value pair that intersects with the calling Rect
object. If no collisions are found, `None` is returned. If `use_values` is 0
(default) then the dict's keys will be used in the collision detection,
otherwise the dict's values will be used.

Note

Rect objects cannot be used as keys in a dictionary (they are not hashable),
so they must be converted to a tuple/list. e.g.
`rect.collidedict({tuple(key_rect) : value})`

collidedictall()

    
test if all rectangles in a dictionary intersect

collidedictall(dict) -> [(key, value), ...]

collidedictall(dict, use_values=0) -> [(key, value), ...]

Returns a list of all the key and value pairs that intersect with the calling
Rect object. If no collisions are found an empty list is returned. If
`use_values` is 0 (default) then the dict's keys will be used in the collision
detection, otherwise the dict's values will be used.

Note

Rect objects cannot be used as keys in a dictionary (they are not hashable),
so they must be converted to a tuple/list. e.g.
`rect.collidedictall({tuple(key_rect) : value})`
