#  pygame.gfxdraw

    
pygame module for drawing shapes

EXPERIMENTAL!: This API may change or disappear in later pygame releases. If
you use this, your code may break with the next pygame release.

The pygame package does not import gfxdraw automatically when loaded, so it
must imported explicitly to be used.

    
    import pygame
    import pygame.gfxdraw
For all functions the arguments are strictly positional and integers are
accepted for coordinates and radii. The `color` argument can be one of the
following formats:

>   * a `pygame.Color` object
>   * an `(RGB)` triplet (tuple/list)
>   * an `(RGBA)` quadruplet (tuple/list)
>

The functions `rectangle()` and `box()` will accept any `(x, y, w, h)`
sequence for their `rect` argument, though `pygame.Rect` instances are
preferred.

To draw a filled antialiased shape, first use the antialiased (aa*) version of
the function, and then use the filled (filled_*) version. For example:

    
    col = (255, 0, 0)
    surf.fill((255, 255, 255))
    pygame.gfxdraw.aacircle(surf, x, y, 30, col)
    pygame.gfxdraw.filled_circle(surf, x, y, 30, col)
Note

For threading, each of the functions releases the GIL during the C part of the
call.

Note

See the `pygame.draw` module for alternative draw methods. The
`pygame.gfxdraw` module differs from the `pygame.draw` module in the API it
uses and the different draw functions available. `pygame.gfxdraw` wraps the
primitives from the library called SDL_gfx, rather than using modified
versions.

New in pygame 1.9.0.
