#  pygame.mixer

    
pygame module for loading and playing sounds

This module contains classes for loading Sound objects and controlling
playback. The mixer module is optional and depends on SDL_mixer. Your program
should test that `pygame.mixer` is available and initialized before using it.

The mixer module has a limited number of channels for playback of sounds.
Usually programs tell pygame to start playing audio and it selects an
available channel automatically. The default is 8 simultaneous channels, but
complex programs can get more precise control over the number of channels and
their use.

All sound playback is mixed in background threads. When you begin to play a
Sound object, it will return immediately while the sound continues to play. A
single Sound object can also be actively played back multiple times.

The mixer also has a special streaming channel. This is for music playback and
is accessed through the `pygame.mixer.music` module.

The mixer module must be initialized like other pygame modules, but it has
some extra conditions. The `pygame.mixer.init()` function takes several
optional arguments to control the playback rate and sample size. Pygame will
default to reasonable values, but pygame cannot perform Sound resampling, so
the mixer should be initialized to match the values of your audio resources.

`NOTE`: For less laggy sound use a smaller buffer size. The default is set to
reduce the chance of scratchy sounds on some computers. You can change the
default buffer by calling `pygame.mixer.pre_init()` before
`pygame.mixer.init()` or `pygame.init()` is called. For example:
`pygame.mixer.pre_init(44100,-16,2, 1024)`

pygame.mixer.init()

    
initialize the mixer module

init(frequency=44100, size=-16, channels=2, buffer=512, devicename=None, allowedchanges=AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE | AUDIO_ALLOW_CHANNELS_CHANGE) -> None
Initialize the mixer module for Sound loading and playback. The default
arguments can be overridden to provide specific audio mixing. Keyword
arguments are accepted. For backward compatibility where an argument is set
zero the default value is used (possible changed by a pre_init call).

The size argument represents how many bits are used for each audio sample. If
the value is negative then signed sample values will be used. Positive values
mean unsigned audio samples will be used. An invalid value raises an
exception.

The channels argument is used to specify whether to use mono or stereo. 1 for
mono and 2 for stereo.

The buffer argument controls the number of internal samples used in the sound
mixer. The default value should work for most cases. It can be lowered to
reduce latency, but sound dropout may occur. It can be raised to larger values
to ensure playback never skips, but it will impose latency on sound playback.
The buffer size must be a power of two (if not it is rounded up to the next
nearest power of 2).

Some platforms require the `pygame.mixer` module to be initialized after the
display modules have initialized. The top level `pygame.init()` takes care of
this automatically, but cannot pass any arguments to the mixer init. To solve
this, mixer has a function `pygame.mixer.pre_init()` to set the proper
defaults before the toplevel init is used.

When using allowedchanges=0 it will convert the samples at runtime to match
what the hardware supports. For example a sound card may not support 16bit
sound samples, so instead it will use 8bit samples internally. If
AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE is supplied, then the requested format will change
to the closest that SDL2 supports.

Apart from 0, allowedchanged accepts the following constants ORed together:

>   * AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE
>   * AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE
>   * AUDIO_ALLOW_CHANNELS_CHANGE
>   * AUDIO_ALLOW_ANY_CHANGE
>

It is safe to call this more than once, but after the mixer is initialized you
cannot change the playback arguments without first calling
`pygame.mixer.quit()`.

Changed in pygame 1.8: The default `buffersize` was changed from 1024 to 3072.

Changed in pygame 1.9.1: The default `buffersize` was changed from 3072 to
4096.

Changed in pygame 2.0.0: The default `buffersize` was changed from 4096 to
512. The default frequency changed to 44100 from 22050.

Changed in pygame 2.0.0: `size` can be 32 (32bit floats).

Changed in pygame 2.0.0: `channels` can also be 4 or 6.

New in pygame 2.0.0: `allowedchanges` argument added

pygame.mixer.pre_init()

    
preset the mixer init arguments

pre_init(frequency=44100, size=-16, channels=2, buffer=512, devicename=None)
-> None

Call pre_init to change the defaults used when the real `pygame.mixer.init()`
is called. Keyword arguments are accepted. The best way to set custom mixer
playback values is to call `pygame.mixer.pre_init()` before calling the top
level `pygame.init()`. For backward compatibility argument values of zero are
replaced with the startup defaults.

Changed in pygame 1.8: The default `buffersize` was changed from 1024 to 3072.

Changed in pygame 1.9.1: The default `buffersize` was changed from 3072 to
4096.

Changed in pygame 2.0.0: The default `buffersize` was changed from 4096 to
512. The default frequency changed to 44100 from 22050.

pygame.mixer.quit()

    
uninitialize the mixer

quit() -> None

This will uninitialize `pygame.mixer`. All playback will stop and any loaded
Sound objects may not be compatible with the mixer if it is reinitialized
later.

pygame.mixer.get_init()

    
test if the mixer is initialized

get_init() -> (frequency, format, channels)

If the mixer is initialized, this returns the playback arguments it is using.
If the mixer has not been initialized this returns `None`.

pygame.mixer.stop()

    
stop playback of all sound channels

stop() -> None

This will stop all playback of all active mixer channels.

pygame.mixer.pause()

    
temporarily stop playback of all sound channels

pause() -> None

This will temporarily stop all playback on the active mixer channels. The
playback can later be resumed with `pygame.mixer.unpause()`

pygame.mixer.unpause()

    
resume paused playback of sound channels

unpause() -> None

This will resume all active sound channels after they have been paused.

pygame.mixer.fadeout()

    
fade out the volume on all sounds before stopping

fadeout(time) -> None

This will fade out the volume on all active channels over the time argument in
milliseconds. After the sound is muted the playback will stop.

pygame.mixer.set_num_channels()

    
set the total number of playback channels

set_num_channels(count) -> None

Sets the number of available channels for the mixer. The default value is 8.
The value can be increased or decreased. If the value is decreased, sounds
playing on the truncated channels are stopped.

pygame.mixer.get_num_channels()

    
get the total number of playback channels

get_num_channels() -> count

Returns the number of currently active playback channels.

pygame.mixer.set_reserved()

    
reserve channels from being automatically used

set_reserved(count) -> None

The mixer can reserve any number of channels that will not be automatically
selected for playback by Sounds. If sounds are currently playing on the
reserved channels they will not be stopped.

This allows the application to reserve a specific number of channels for
important sounds that must not be dropped or have a guaranteed channel to play
on.

pygame.mixer.find_channel()

    
find an unused channel

find_channel(force=False) -> Channel

This will find and return an inactive Channel object. If there are no inactive
Channels this function will return `None`. If there are no inactive channels
and the force argument is `True`, this will find the Channel with the longest
running Sound and return it.

If the mixer has reserved channels from `pygame.mixer.set_reserved()` then
those channels will not be returned here.

pygame.mixer.get_busy()

    
test if any sound is being mixed

get_busy() -> bool

Returns `True` if the mixer is busy mixing any channels. If the mixer is idle
then this return `False`.

pygame.mixer.get_sdl_mixer_version()

    
get the mixer's SDL version

get_sdl_mixer_version() -> (major, minor, patch)

get_sdl_mixer_version(linked=True) -> (major, minor, patch)

Parameters: |  linked (bool) -- if `True` (default) the linked version number is returned, otherwise the compiled version number is returned  
---|---  
Returns: | the mixer's SDL library version number (linked or compiled depending on the `linked` parameter) as a tuple of 3 integers `(major, minor, patch)`  
Return type: | tuple  
Note

The linked and compile version numbers should be the same.

New in pygame 2.0.0.

pygame.mixer.Sound

    
Create a new Sound object from a file or buffer object

Sound(filename) -> Sound

Sound(file=filename) -> Sound

Sound(buffer) -> Sound

Sound(buffer=buffer) -> Sound

Sound(object) -> Sound

Sound(file=object) -> Sound

Sound(array=object) -> Sound

Load a new sound buffer from a filename, a python file object or a readable
buffer object. Limited resampling will be performed to help the sample match
the initialize arguments for the mixer. A Unicode string can only be a file
pathname. A Python 2.x string or a Python 3.x bytes object can be either a
pathname or a buffer object. Use the 'file' or 'buffer' keywords to avoid
ambiguity; otherwise Sound may guess wrong. If the array keyword is used, the
object is expected to export a version 3, `C` level array interface or, for
Python 2.6 or later, a new buffer interface (The object is checked for a
buffer interface first.)

The Sound object represents actual sound sample data. Methods that change the
state of the Sound object will the all instances of the Sound playback. A
Sound object also exports an array interface, and, for Python 2.6 or later, a
new buffer interface.

The Sound can be loaded from an `OGG` audio file or from an uncompressed
`WAV`.

Note: The buffer will be copied internally, no data will be shared between it
and the Sound object.

For now buffer and array support is consistent with `sndarray.make_sound` for
Numeric arrays, in that sample sign and byte order are ignored. This will
change, either by correctly handling sign and byte order, or by raising an
exception when different. Also, source samples are truncated to fit the audio
sample size. This will not change.

New in pygame 1.8: `pygame.mixer.Sound(buffer)`

New in pygame 1.9.2: `pygame.mixer.Sound` keyword arguments and array
interface support

play()

    
begin sound playback

play(loops=0, maxtime=0, fade_ms=0) -> Channel

Begin playback of the Sound (i.e., on the computer's speakers) on an available
Channel. This will forcibly select a Channel, so playback may cut off a
currently playing sound if necessary.

The loops argument controls how many times the sample will be repeated after
being played the first time. A value of 5 means that the sound will be played
once, then repeated five times, and so is played a total of six times. The
default value (zero) means the Sound is not repeated, and so is only played
once. If loops is set to -1 the Sound will loop indefinitely (though you can
still call `stop()` to stop it).

The maxtime argument can be used to stop playback after a given number of
milliseconds.

The fade_ms argument will make the sound start playing at 0 volume and fade up
to full volume over the time given. The sample may end before the fade-in is
complete.

This returns the Channel object for the channel that was selected.

stop()

    
stop sound playback

stop() -> None

This will stop the playback of this Sound on any active Channels.

fadeout()

    
stop sound playback after fading out

fadeout(time) -> None

This will stop playback of the sound after fading it out over the time
argument in milliseconds. The Sound will fade and stop on all actively playing
channels.

set_volume()

    
set the playback volume for this Sound

set_volume(value) -> None

This will set the playback volume (loudness) for this Sound. This will
immediately affect the Sound if it is playing. It will also affect any future
playback of this Sound.

Parameters: |  value (float) -- volume in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 (inclusive) If value < 0.0, the volume will not be changed If value > 1.0, the volume will be set to 1.0  
---|---  
get_volume()

    
get the playback volume

get_volume() -> value

Return a value from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the volume for this Sound.

get_num_channels()

    
count how many times this Sound is playing

get_num_channels() -> count

Return the number of active channels this sound is playing on.

get_length()

    
get the length of the Sound

get_length() -> seconds

Return the length of this Sound in seconds.

get_raw()

    
return a bytestring copy of the Sound samples.

get_raw() -> bytes

Return a copy of the Sound object buffer as a bytes (for Python 3.x) or str
(for Python 2.x) object.

New in pygame 1.9.2.

pygame.mixer.Channel

    
Create a Channel object for controlling playback

Channel(id) -> Channel

Return a Channel object for one of the current channels. The id must be a
value from 0 to the value of `pygame.mixer.get_num_channels()`.

The Channel object can be used to get fine control over the playback of
Sounds. A channel can only playback a single Sound at time. Using channels is
entirely optional since pygame can manage them by default.

play()

    
play a Sound on a specific Channel

play(Sound, loops=0, maxtime=0, fade_ms=0) -> None

This will begin playback of a Sound on a specific Channel. If the Channel is
currently playing any other Sound it will be stopped.

The loops argument has the same meaning as in `Sound.play()`: it is the number
of times to repeat the sound after the first time. If it is 3, the sound will
be played 4 times (the first time, then three more). If loops is -1 then the
playback will repeat indefinitely.

As in `Sound.play()`, the maxtime argument can be used to stop playback of the
Sound after a given number of milliseconds.

As in `Sound.play()`, the fade_ms argument can be used fade in the sound.

stop()

    
stop playback on a Channel

stop() -> None

Stop sound playback on a channel. After playback is stopped the channel
becomes available for new Sounds to play on it.

pause()

    
temporarily stop playback of a channel

pause() -> None

Temporarily stop the playback of sound on a channel. It can be resumed at a
later time with `Channel.unpause()`

unpause()

    
resume pause playback of a channel

unpause() -> None

Resume the playback on a paused channel.

fadeout()

    
stop playback after fading channel out

fadeout(time) -> None

Stop playback of a channel after fading out the sound over the given time
argument in milliseconds.

set_volume()

    
set the volume of a playing channel

set_volume(value) -> None

set_volume(left, right) -> None

Set the volume (loudness) of a playing sound. When a channel starts to play
its volume value is reset. This only affects the current sound. The value
argument is between 0.0 and 1.0.

If one argument is passed, it will be the volume of both speakers. If two
arguments are passed and the mixer is in stereo mode, the first argument will
be the volume of the left speaker and the second will be the volume of the
right speaker. (If the second argument is `None`, the first argument will be
the volume of both speakers.)

If the channel is playing a Sound on which `set_volume()` has also been
called, both calls are taken into account. For example:

    
    sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("s.wav")
    channel = s.play()      # Sound plays at full volume by default
    sound.set_volume(0.9)   # Now plays at 90% of full volume.
    sound.set_volume(0.6)   # Now plays at 60% (previous value replaced).
    channel.set_volume(0.5) # Now plays at 30% (0.6 * 0.5).
get_volume()

    
get the volume of the playing channel

get_volume() -> value

Return the volume of the channel for the current playing sound. This does not
take into account stereo separation used by `Channel.set_volume()`. The Sound
object also has its own volume which is mixed with the channel.

get_busy()

    
check if the channel is active

get_busy() -> bool

Returns `True` if the channel is actively mixing sound. If the channel is idle
this returns `False`.

get_sound()

    
get the currently playing Sound

get_sound() -> Sound

Return the actual Sound object currently playing on this channel. If the
channel is idle `None` is returned.

queue()

    
queue a Sound object to follow the current

queue(Sound) -> None

When a Sound is queued on a Channel, it will begin playing immediately after
the current Sound is finished. Each channel can only have a single Sound
queued at a time. The queued Sound will only play if the current playback
finished automatically. It is cleared on any other call to `Channel.stop()` or
`Channel.play()`.

If there is no sound actively playing on the Channel then the Sound will begin
playing immediately.

get_queue()

    
return any Sound that is queued

get_queue() -> Sound

If a Sound is already queued on this channel it will be returned. Once the
queued sound begins playback it will no longer be on the queue.

set_endevent()

    
have the channel send an event when playback stops

set_endevent() -> None

set_endevent(type) -> None

When an endevent is set for a channel, it will send an event to the pygame
queue every time a sound finishes playing on that channel (not just the first
time). Use `pygame.event.get()` to retrieve the endevent once it's sent.

Note that if you called `Sound.play(n)` or `Channel.play(sound,n)`, the end
event is sent only once: after the sound has been played "n+1" times (see the
documentation of Sound.play).

If `Channel.stop()` or `Channel.play()` is called while the sound was still
playing, the event will be posted immediately.

The type argument will be the event id sent to the queue. This can be any
valid event type, but a good choice would be a value between
`pygame.locals.USEREVENT` and `pygame.locals.NUMEVENTS`. If no type argument
is given then the Channel will stop sending endevents.

get_endevent()

    
get the event a channel sends when playback stops

get_endevent() -> type

Returns the event type to be sent every time the Channel finishes playback of
a Sound. If there is no endevent the function returns `pygame.NOEVENT`.
