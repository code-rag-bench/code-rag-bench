#  pygame.midi

    
pygame module for interacting with midi input and output.

New in pygame 1.9.0.

The midi module can send output to midi devices and get input from midi
devices. It can also list midi devices on the system.

The midi module supports real and virtual midi devices.

It uses the portmidi library. Is portable to which ever platforms portmidi
supports (currently Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux).

This uses pyportmidi for now, but may use its own bindings at some point in
the future. The pyportmidi bindings are included with pygame.

  

New in pygame 2.0.0.

These are pygame events (`pygame.event`) reserved for midi use. The `MIDIIN`
event is used by `pygame.midi.midis2events()` when converting midi events to
pygame events.

    
    MIDIIN
    MIDIOUT
  

pygame.midi.init()

    
initialize the midi module

init() -> None

Initializes the `pygame.midi` module. Must be called before using the
`pygame.midi` module.

It is safe to call this more than once.

pygame.midi.quit()

    
uninitialize the midi module

quit() -> None

Uninitializes the `pygame.midi` module. If `pygame.midi.init()` was called to
initialize the `pygame.midi` module, then this function will be called
automatically when your program exits.

It is safe to call this function more than once.

pygame.midi.get_init()

    
returns True if the midi module is currently initialized

get_init() -> bool

Gets the initialization state of the `pygame.midi` module.

Returns: |  `True` if the `pygame.midi` module is currently initialized.  
---|---  
Return type: | bool  
New in pygame 1.9.5.

pygame.midi.Input

    
Input is used to get midi input from midi devices.

Input(device_id) -> None

Input(device_id, buffer_size) -> None

Parameters: | 
  * device_id (int) -- midi device id
  * buffer_size (int) -- (optional) the number of input events to be buffered

  
---|---  
close()

    
closes a midi stream, flushing any pending buffers.

close() -> None

PortMidi attempts to close open streams when the application exits.

Note

This is particularly difficult under Windows.

poll()

    
returns True if there's data, or False if not.

poll() -> bool

Used to indicate if any data exists.

Returns: |  `True` if there is data, `False` otherwise  
---|---  
Return type: | bool  
Raises: |  MidiException \-- on error  
read()

    
reads num_events midi events from the buffer.

read(num_events) -> midi_event_list

Reads from the input buffer and gives back midi events.

Parameters: |  num_events (int) -- number of input events to read  
---|---  
Returns: | the format for midi_event_list is `[[[status, data1, data2, data3], timestamp], ...]`  
Return type: | list  
pygame.midi.Output

    
Output is used to send midi to an output device

Output(device_id) -> None

Output(device_id, latency=0) -> None

Output(device_id, buffer_size=256) -> None

Output(device_id, latency, buffer_size) -> None

The `buffer_size` specifies the number of output events to be buffered waiting
for output. In some cases (see below) PortMidi does not buffer output at all
and merely passes data to a lower-level API, in which case buffersize is
ignored.

`latency` is the delay in milliseconds applied to timestamps to determine when
the output should actually occur. If `latency` is <<0, 0 is assumed.

If `latency` is zero, timestamps are ignored and all output is delivered
immediately. If `latency` is greater than zero, output is delayed until the
message timestamp plus the `latency`. In some cases, PortMidi can obtain
better timing than your application by passing timestamps along to the device
driver or hardware. Latency may also help you to synchronize midi data to
audio data by matching midi latency to the audio buffer latency.

Note

Time is measured relative to the time source indicated by time_proc.
Timestamps are absolute, not relative delays or offsets.

abort()

    
terminates outgoing messages immediately

abort() -> None

The caller should immediately close the output port; this call may result in
transmission of a partial midi message. There is no abort for Midi input
because the user can simply ignore messages in the buffer and close an input
device at any time.

close()

    
closes a midi stream, flushing any pending buffers.

close() -> None

PortMidi attempts to close open streams when the application exits.

Note

This is particularly difficult under Windows.

note_off()

    
turns a midi note off (note must be on)

note_off(note, velocity=None, channel=0) -> None

Turn a note off in the output stream. The note must already be on for this to
work correctly.

note_on()

    
turns a midi note on (note must be off)

note_on(note, velocity=None, channel=0) -> None

Turn a note on in the output stream. The note must already be off for this to
work correctly.

set_instrument()

    
select an instrument, with a value between 0 and 127

set_instrument(instrument_id, channel=0) -> None

Select an instrument.

pitch_bend()

    
modify the pitch of a channel.

set_instrument(value=0, channel=0) -> None

Adjust the pitch of a channel. The value is a signed integer from -8192 to
+8191. For example, 0 means "no change", +4096 is typically a semitone higher,
and -8192 is 1 whole tone lower (though the musical range corresponding to the
pitch bend range can also be changed in some synthesizers).

If no value is given, the pitch bend is returned to "no change".

New in pygame 1.9.4.

write()

    
writes a list of midi data to the Output

write(data) -> None

Writes series of MIDI information in the form of a list.

Parameters: |  data (list) -- data to write, the expected format is `[[[status, data1=0, data2=0, ...], timestamp], ...]` with the `data#` fields being optional  
---|---  
Raises: |  IndexError \-- if more than 1024 elements in the data list  
Example:

    
    # Program change at time 20000 and 500ms later send note 65 with
    # velocity 100.
    write([[[0xc0, 0, 0], 20000], [[0x90, 60, 100], 20500]])
Note

  * Timestamps will be ignored if latency = 0
  * To get a note to play immediately, send MIDI info with timestamp read from function Time
  * Optional data fields: `write([[[0xc0, 0, 0], 20000]])` is equivalent to `write([[[0xc0], 20000]])`

write_short()

    
writes up to 3 bytes of midi data to the Output

write_short(status) -> None

write_short(status, data1=0, data2=0) -> None

Output MIDI information of 3 bytes or less. The `data` fields are optional and
assumed to be 0 if omitted.

Examples of status byte values:

    
    0xc0  # program change
    0x90  # note on
    # etc.
Example:

    
    # note 65 on with velocity 100
    write_short(0x90, 65, 100)
write_sys_ex()

    
writes a timestamped system-exclusive midi message.

write_sys_ex(when, msg) -> None

Writes a timestamped system-exclusive midi message.

Parameters: | 
  * msg (list[int] or str) -- midi message
  * when \-- timestamp in milliseconds

  
---|---  
Example:

    
    midi_output.write_sys_ex(0, '\xF0\x7D\x10\x11\x12\x13\xF7')
    
    # is equivalent to
    
    midi_output.write_sys_ex(pygame.midi.time(),
                             [0xF0, 0x7D, 0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, 0xF7])
pygame.midi.get_count()

    
gets the number of devices.

get_count() -> num_devices

Device ids range from 0 to `get_count() - 1`

pygame.midi.get_default_input_id()

    
gets default input device number

get_default_input_id() -> default_id

The following describes the usage details for this function and the
`get_default_output_id()` function.

Return the default device ID or `-1` if there are no devices. The result can
be passed to the `Input`/`Output` class.

On a PC the user can specify a default device by setting an environment
variable. To use device #1, for example:

    
    set PM_RECOMMENDED_INPUT_DEVICE=1
    or
    set PM_RECOMMENDED_OUTPUT_DEVICE=1
The user should first determine the available device ID by using the supplied
application "testin" or "testout".

In general, the registry is a better place for this kind of info. With USB
devices that can come and go, using integers is not very reliable for device
identification. Under Windows, if `PM_RECOMMENDED_INPUT_DEVICE` (or
`PM_RECOMMENDED_OUTPUT_DEVICE`) is NOT found in the environment, then the
default device is obtained by looking for a string in the registry under:

    
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/PortMidi/Recommended_Input_Device
    or
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/PortMidi/Recommended_Output_Device
The number of the first device with a substring that matches the string
exactly is returned. For example, if the string in the registry is "USB" and
device 1 is named "In USB MidiSport 1x1", then that will be the default input
because it contains the string "USB".

In addition to the name, `get_device_info()` returns "interf", which is the
interface name. The "interface" is the underlying software system or API used
by PortMidi to access devices. Supported interfaces:

    
    MMSystem   # the only Win32 interface currently supported
    ALSA       # the only Linux interface currently supported
    CoreMIDI   # the only Mac OS X interface currently supported
    # DirectX - not implemented
    # OSS     - not implemented
To specify both the interface and the device name in the registry, separate
the two with a comma and a space. The string before the comma must be a
substring of the "interf" string and the string after the space must be a
substring of the "name" name string in order to match the device. e.g.:

    
    MMSystem, In USB MidiSport 1x1
Note

In the current release, the default is simply the first device (the input or
output device with the lowest PmDeviceID).

pygame.midi.get_default_output_id()

    
gets default output device number

get_default_output_id() -> default_id

See `get_default_input_id()` for usage details.

pygame.midi.get_device_info()

    
returns information about a midi device

get_device_info(an_id) -> (interf, name, input, output, opened)

get_device_info(an_id) -> None

Gets the device info for a given id.

Parameters: |  an_id (int) -- id of the midi device being queried  
---|---  
Returns: | if the id is out of range `None` is returned, otherwise a tuple of (interf, name, input, output, opened) is returned.
>   * interf: string describing the device interface (e.g. 'ALSA')
>   * name: string name of the device (e.g. 'Midi Through Port-0')
>   * input: 1 if the device is an input device, otherwise 0
>   * output: 1 if the device is an output device, otherwise 0
>   * opened: 1 if the device is opened, otherwise 0
>
  
Return type: | tuple or None  
pygame.midi.midis2events()

    
converts midi events to pygame events

midis2events(midi_events, device_id) -> [Event, ...]

Takes a sequence of midi events and returns list of pygame events.

The `midi_events` data is expected to be a sequence of `((status, data1,
data2, data3), timestamp)` midi events (all values required).

Returns: | a list of pygame events of event type `MIDIIN`  
---|---  
Return type: | list  
pygame.midi.time()

    
returns the current time in ms of the PortMidi timer

time() -> time

The time is reset to 0 when the `pygame.midi` module is initialized.

pygame.midi.frequency_to_midi()

    
Converts a frequency into a MIDI note. Rounds to the closest midi note.

frequency_to_midi(midi_note) -> midi_note
