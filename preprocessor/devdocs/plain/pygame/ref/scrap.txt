#  pygame.scrap

    
pygame module for clipboard support.

EXPERIMENTAL!: This API may change or disappear in later pygame releases. If
you use this, your code may break with the next pygame release.

The scrap module is for transferring data to/from the clipboard. This allows
for cutting and pasting data between pygame and other applications. Some basic
data (MIME) types are defined and registered:

    
    pygame         string
    constant        value        description
    --------------------------------------------------
    SCRAP_TEXT   "text/plain"    plain text
    SCRAP_BMP    "image/bmp"     BMP encoded image data
    SCRAP_PBM    "image/pbm"     PBM encoded image data
    SCRAP_PPM    "image/ppm"     PPM encoded image data
`pygame.SCRAP_PPM`, `pygame.SCRAP_PBM` and `pygame.SCRAP_BMP` are suitable for
surface buffers to be shared with other applications. `pygame.SCRAP_TEXT` is
an alias for the plain text clipboard type.

Depending on the platform, additional types are automatically registered when
data is placed into the clipboard to guarantee a consistent sharing behaviour
with other applications. The following listed types can be used as strings to
be passed to the respective `pygame.scrap` module functions.

For Windows platforms, these additional types are supported automatically and
resolve to their internal definitions:

    
    "text/plain;charset=utf-8"   UTF-8 encoded text
    "audio/wav"                  WAV encoded audio
    "image/tiff"                 TIFF encoded image data
For X11 platforms, these additional types are supported automatically and
resolve to their internal definitions:

    
    "text/plain;charset=utf-8"   UTF-8 encoded text
    "UTF8_STRING"                UTF-8 encoded text
    "COMPOUND_TEXT"              COMPOUND text
User defined types can be used, but the data might not be accessible by other
applications unless they know what data type to look for. Example: Data placed
into the clipboard by `pygame.scrap.put("my_data_type", byte_data)` can only
be accessed by applications which query the clipboard for the `"my_data_type"`
data type.

For an example of how the scrap module works refer to the examples page
(`pygame.examples.scrap_clipboard.main()`) or the code directly in GitHub
(pygame/examples/scrap_clipboard.py).

New in pygame 1.8.

Note

The scrap module is currently only supported for Windows, X11 and Mac OS X. On
Mac OS X only text works at the moment - other types may be supported in
future releases.

pygame.scrap.init()

    
Initializes the scrap module.

init() -> None

Initialize the scrap module.

Raises: |  pygame.error \-- if unable to initialize scrap module  
---|---  
  

Note

The scrap module requires `pygame.display.set_mode()` be called before being
initialized.

pygame.scrap.get_init()

    
Returns True if the scrap module is currently initialized.

get_init() -> bool

Gets the scrap module's initialization state.

Returns: |  `True` if the `pygame.scrap` module is currently initialized, `False` otherwise  
---|---  
Return type: | bool  
New in pygame 1.9.5.

pygame.scrap.get()

    
Gets the data for the specified type from the clipboard.

get(type) -> bytes or str or None

Retrieves the data for the specified type from the clipboard. In python 3 the
data is returned as a byte string and might need further processing (such as
decoding to Unicode).

Parameters: |  type (string) -- data type to retrieve from the clipboard  
---|---  
Returns: | data (byte string in python 3 or str in python 2) for the given type identifier or `None` if no data for the given type is available  
Return type: | bytes or str or None  
    
    text = pygame.scrap.get(pygame.SCRAP_TEXT)
    if text:
        print("There is text in the clipboard.")
    else:
        print("There does not seem to be text in the clipboard.")
pygame.scrap.get_types()

    
Gets a list of the available clipboard types.

get_types() -> list

Gets a list of data type string identifiers for the data currently available
on the clipboard. Each identifier can be used in the `pygame.scrap.get()`
method to get the clipboard content of the specific type.

Returns: | list of strings of the available clipboard data types, if there is no data in the clipboard an empty list is returned  
---|---  
Return type: | list  
    
    for t in pygame.scrap.get_types():
        if "text" in t:
            # There is some content with the word "text" in its type string.
            print(pygame.scrap.get(t))
pygame.scrap.put()

    
Places data into the clipboard.

put(type, data) -> None

Places data for a given clipboard type into the clipboard. The data must be a
string buffer. The type is a string identifying the type of data to be placed
into the clipboard. This can be one of the predefined `pygame.SCRAP_PBM`,
`pygame.SCRAP_PPM`, `pygame.SCRAP_BMP` or `pygame.SCRAP_TEXT` values or a user
defined string identifier.

Parameters: | 
  * type (string) -- type identifier of the data to be placed into the clipboard
  * data (bytes or str) -- data to be place into the clipboard (in python 3 data is a byte string and in python 2 data is a str)

  
---|---  
Raises: |  pygame.error \-- if unable to put the data into the clipboard  
    
    with open("example.bmp", "rb") as fp:
        pygame.scrap.put(pygame.SCRAP_BMP, fp.read())
    # The image data is now on the clipboard for other applications to access
    # it.
    pygame.scrap.put(pygame.SCRAP_TEXT, b"A text to copy")
    pygame.scrap.put("Plain text", b"Data for user defined type 'Plain text'")
pygame.scrap.contains()

    
Checks whether data for a given type is available in the clipboard.

contains(type) -> bool

Checks whether data for the given type is currently available in the
clipboard.

Parameters: |  type (string) -- data type to check availability of  
---|---  
Returns: |  `True` if data for the passed type is available in the clipboard, `False` otherwise  
Return type: | bool  
    
    if pygame.scrap.contains(pygame.SCRAP_TEXT):
        print("There is text in the clipboard.")
    if pygame.scrap.contains("own_data_type"):
        print("There is stuff in the clipboard.")
pygame.scrap.lost()

    
Indicates if the clipboard ownership has been lost by the pygame application.

lost() -> bool

Indicates if the clipboard ownership has been lost by the pygame application.

Returns: |  `True`, if the clipboard ownership has been lost by the pygame application, `False` if the pygame application still owns the clipboard  
---|---  
Return type: | bool  
    
    if pygame.scrap.lost():
        print("The clipboard is in use by another application.")
pygame.scrap.set_mode()

    
Sets the clipboard access mode.

set_mode(mode) -> None

Sets the access mode for the clipboard. This is only of interest for X11
environments where clipboard modes `pygame.SCRAP_SELECTION` (for mouse
selections) and `pygame.SCRAP_CLIPBOARD` (for the clipboard) are available.
Setting the mode to `pygame.SCRAP_SELECTION` in other environments will not
change the mode from `pygame.SCRAP_CLIPBOARD`.

Parameters: |  mode \-- access mode, supported values are `pygame.SCRAP_CLIPBOARD` and `pygame.SCRAP_SELECTION` (`pygame.SCRAP_SELECTION` only has an effect when used on X11 platforms)  
---|---  
Raises: |  ValueError \-- if the `mode` parameter is not `pygame.SCRAP_CLIPBOARD` or `pygame.SCRAP_SELECTION`
