# Benchmark Utils - torch.utils.benchmark

`class torch.utils.benchmark.Timer(stmt='pass', setup='pass', global_setup='',
timer=<built-in function perf_counter>, globals=None, label=None,
sub_label=None, description=None, env=None, num_threads=1,
language=Language.PYTHON)` [source]

    
Helper class for measuring execution time of PyTorch statements.

For a full tutorial on how to use this class, see:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/benchmark.html

The PyTorch Timer is based on `timeit.Timer` (and in fact uses `timeit.Timer`
internally), but with several key differences:

  1. Runtime aware:
    
Timer will perform warmups (important as some elements of PyTorch are lazily
initialized), set threadpool size so that comparisons are apples-to-apples,
and synchronize asynchronous CUDA functions when necessary.

  2. Focus on replicates:
    
When measuring code, and particularly complex kernels / models, run-to-run
variation is a significant confounding factor. It is expected that all
measurements should include replicates to quantify noise and allow median
computation, which is more robust than mean. To that effect, this class
deviates from the `timeit` API by conceptually merging `timeit.Timer.repeat`
and `timeit.Timer.autorange`. (Exact algorithms are discussed in method
docstrings.) The `timeit` method is replicated for cases where an adaptive
strategy is not desired.

  3. Optional metadata:
    
When defining a Timer, one can optionally specify `label`, `sub_label`,
`description`, and `env`. (Defined later) These fields are included in the
representation of result object and by the `Compare` class to group and
display results for comparison.

  4. Instruction counts
    
In addition to wall times, Timer can run a statement under Callgrind and
report instructions executed.

Directly analogous to `timeit.Timer` constructor arguments:

`stmt`, `setup`, `timer`, `globals`

PyTorch Timer specific constructor arguments:

`label`, `sub_label`, `description`, `env`, `num_threads`

Parameters

    
  * stmt (str) – Code snippet to be run in a loop and timed.
  * setup (str) – Optional setup code. Used to define variables used in `stmt`
  * global_setup (str) – (C++ only) Code which is placed at the top level of the file for things like `#include` statements.
  * timer (Callable[[], float]) – Callable which returns the current time. If PyTorch was built without CUDA or there is no GPU present, this defaults to `timeit.default_timer`; otherwise it will synchronize CUDA before measuring the time.
  * globals (Optional[Dict[str, Any]]) – A dict which defines the global variables when `stmt` is being executed. This is the other method for providing variables which `stmt` needs.
  * label (Optional[str]) – String which summarizes `stmt`. For instance, if `stmt` is “torch.nn.functional.relu(torch.add(x, 1, out=out))” one might set label to “ReLU(x + 1)” to improve readability.
  * sub_label (Optional[str]) – 
Provide supplemental information to disambiguate measurements with identical
stmt or label. For instance, in our example above sub_label might be “float”
or “int”, so that it is easy to differentiate: “ReLU(x + 1): (float)”

”ReLU(x + 1): (int)” when printing Measurements or summarizing using
`Compare`.

  * description (Optional[str]) – 
String to distinguish measurements with identical label and sub_label. The
principal use of `description` is to signal to `Compare` the columns of data.
For instance one might set it based on the input size to create a table of the
form:

                                | n=1 | n=4 | ...
                            ------------- ...
    ReLU(x + 1): (float)    | ... | ... | ...
    ReLU(x + 1): (int)      | ... | ... | ...
    
using `Compare`. It is also included when printing a Measurement.

  * env (Optional[str]) – This tag indicates that otherwise identical tasks were run in different environments, and are therefore not equivalent, for instance when A/B testing a change to a kernel. `Compare` will treat Measurements with different `env` specification as distinct when merging replicate runs.
  * num_threads (int) – The size of the PyTorch threadpool when executing `stmt`. Single threaded performance is important as both a key inference workload and a good indicator of intrinsic algorithmic efficiency, so the default is set to one. This is in contrast to the default PyTorch threadpool size which tries to utilize all cores.

`blocked_autorange(callback=None, min_run_time=0.2)` [source]

    
Measure many replicates while keeping timer overhead to a minimum.

At a high level, blocked_autorange executes the following pseudo-code:

    
    `setup`
    
    total_time = 0
    while total_time < min_run_time
        start = timer()
        for _ in range(block_size):
            `stmt`
        total_time += (timer() - start)
    
Note the variable `block_size` in the inner loop. The choice of block size is
important to measurement quality, and must balance two competing objectives:

  1. A small block size results in more replicates and generally better statistics.
  2. A large block size better amortizes the cost of `timer` invocation, and results in a less biased measurement. This is important because CUDA synchronization time is non-trivial (order single to low double digit microseconds) and would otherwise bias the measurement.

blocked_autorange sets block_size by running a warmup period, increasing block
size until timer overhead is less than 0.1% of the overall computation. This
value is then used for the main measurement loop.

Returns

    
A `Measurement` object that contains measured runtimes and repetition counts,
and can be used to compute statistics. (mean, median, etc.)

Return type

    
Measurement

`collect_callgrind(number: int, *, repeats: None, collect_baseline: bool,
retain_out_file: bool) → CallgrindStats` [source]

collect_callgrind(number:int, *, repeats:int, collect_baseline:bool,
retain_out_file:bool) → Tuple[CallgrindStats,...]

    
Collect instruction counts using Callgrind.

Unlike wall times, instruction counts are deterministic (modulo non-
determinism in the program itself and small amounts of jitter from the Python
interpreter.) This makes them ideal for detailed performance analysis. This
method runs `stmt` in a separate process so that Valgrind can instrument the
program. Performance is severely degraded due to the instrumentation, however
this is ameliorated by the fact that a small number of iterations is generally
sufficient to obtain good measurements.

In order to to use this method `valgrind`, `callgrind_control`, and
`callgrind_annotate` must be installed.

Because there is a process boundary between the caller (this process) and the
`stmt` execution, `globals` cannot contain arbitrary in-memory data
structures. (Unlike timing methods) Instead, globals are restricted to
builtins, `nn.Modules`’s, and TorchScripted functions/modules to reduce the
surprise factor from serialization and subsequent deserialization. The
`GlobalsBridge` class provides more detail on this subject. Take particular
care with nn.Modules: they rely on pickle and you may need to add an import to
`setup` for them to transfer properly.

By default, a profile for an empty statement will be collected and cached to
indicate how many instructions are from the Python loop which drives `stmt`.

Returns

    
A `CallgrindStats` object which provides instruction counts and some basic
facilities for analyzing and manipulating results.

`timeit(number=1000000)` [source]

    
Mirrors the semantics of timeit.Timer.timeit().

Execute the main statement (`stmt`) `number` times.

Return type

    
Measurement

`class torch.utils.benchmark.Measurement(number_per_run, raw_times, task_spec,
metadata=None)` [source]

    
The result of a Timer measurement.

This class stores one or more measurements of a given statement. It is
serializable and provides several convenience methods (including a detailed
__repr__) for downstream consumers.

`static merge(measurements)` [source]

    
Convenience method for merging replicates.

Merge will extrapolate times to `number_per_run=1` and will not transfer any
metadata. (Since it might differ between replicates)

Return type

    
List[Measurement]

`property significant_figures: int`

    
Approximate significant figure estimate.

This property is intended to give a convenient way to estimate the precision
of a measurement. It only uses the interquartile region to estimate statistics
to try to mitigate skew from the tails, and uses a static z value of 1.645
since it is not expected to be used for small values of `n`, so z can
approximate `t`.

The significant figure estimation used in conjunction with the `trim_sigfig`
method to provide a more human interpretable data summary. __repr__ does not
use this method; it simply displays raw values. Significant figure estimation
is intended for `Compare`.

`class torch.utils.benchmark.CallgrindStats(task_spec, number_per_run,
built_with_debug_symbols, baseline_inclusive_stats, baseline_exclusive_stats,
stmt_inclusive_stats, stmt_exclusive_stats, stmt_callgrind_out)` [source]

    
Top level container for Callgrind results collected by Timer.

Manipulation is generally done using the FunctionCounts class, which is
obtained by calling `CallgrindStats.stats(…)`. Several convenience methods are
provided as well; the most significant is `CallgrindStats.as_standardized()`.

`as_standardized()` [source]

    
Strip library names and some prefixes from function strings.

When comparing two different sets of instruction counts, on stumbling block
can be path prefixes. Callgrind includes the full filepath when reporting a
function (as it should). However, this can cause issues when diffing profiles.
If a key component such as Python or PyTorch was built in separate locations
in the two profiles, which can result in something resembling:

    
    23234231 /tmp/first_build_dir/thing.c:foo(...)
     9823794 /tmp/first_build_dir/thing.c:bar(...)
      ...
       53453 .../aten/src/Aten/...:function_that_actually_changed(...)
      ...
     -9823794 /tmp/second_build_dir/thing.c:bar(...)
    -23234231 /tmp/second_build_dir/thing.c:foo(...)
    
Stripping prefixes can ameliorate this issue by regularizing the strings and
causing better cancellation of equivalent call sites when diffing.

Return type

    
CallgrindStats

`counts(*, denoise=False)` [source]

    
Returns the total number of instructions executed.

See `FunctionCounts.denoise()` for an explanation of the `denoise` arg.

Return type

    
int

`delta(other, inclusive=False)` [source]

    
Diff two sets of counts.

One common reason to collect instruction counts is to determine the the effect
that a particular change will have on the number of instructions needed to
perform some unit of work. If a change increases that number, the next logical
question is “why”. This generally involves looking at what part if the code
increased in instruction count. This function automates that process so that
one can easily diff counts on both an inclusive and exclusive basis.

Return type

    
FunctionCounts

`stats(inclusive=False)` [source]

    
Returns detailed function counts.

Conceptually, the FunctionCounts returned can be thought of as a tuple of
(count, path_and_function_name) tuples.

`inclusive` matches the semantics of callgrind. If True, the counts include
instructions executed by children. `inclusive=True` is useful for identifying
hot spots in code; `inclusive=False` is useful for reducing noise when diffing
counts from two different runs. (See CallgrindStats.delta(…) for more details)

Return type

    
FunctionCounts

`class torch.utils.benchmark.FunctionCounts(_data, inclusive,
truncate_rows=True, _linewidth=None)` [source]

    
Container for manipulating Callgrind results.

It supports:

    
  1. Addition and subtraction to combine or diff results.
  2. Tuple-like indexing.
  3. A `denoise` function which strips CPython calls which are known to be non-deterministic and quite noisy.
  4. Two higher order methods (`filter` and `transform`) for custom manipulation.

`denoise()` [source]

    
Remove known noisy instructions.

Several instructions in the CPython interpreter are rather noisy. These
instructions involve unicode to dictionary lookups which Python uses to map
variable names. FunctionCounts is generally a content agnostic container,
however this is sufficiently important for obtaining reliable results to
warrant an exception.

Return type

    
FunctionCounts

`filter(filter_fn)` [source]

    
Keep only the elements where `filter_fn` applied to function name returns
True.

Return type

    
FunctionCounts

`transform(map_fn)` [source]

    
Apply `map_fn` to all of the function names.

This can be used to regularize function names (e.g. stripping irrelevant parts
of the file path), coalesce entries by mapping multiple functions to the same
name (in which case the counts are added together), etc.

Return type

    
FunctionCounts
