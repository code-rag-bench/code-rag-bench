# Automatic differentiation package - torch.autograd

`torch.autograd` provides classes and functions implementing automatic
differentiation of arbitrary scalar valued functions. It requires minimal
changes to the existing code - you only need to declare `Tensor` s for which
gradients should be computed with the `requires_grad=True` keyword. As of now,
we only support autograd for floating point `Tensor` types ( half, float,
double and bfloat16) and complex `Tensor` types (cfloat, cdouble).

`backward` | Computes the sum of gradients of given tensors with respect to graph leaves.  
---|---  
`grad` | Computes and returns the sum of gradients of outputs with respect to the inputs.  
## Forward-mode Automatic Differentiation

Warning

This API is in beta. Even though the function signatures are very unlikely to
change, improved operator coverage is planned before we consider this stable.

Please see the forward-mode AD tutorial for detailed steps on how to use this
API.

`forward_ad.dual_level` | Context-manager that enables forward AD.  
---|---  
`forward_ad.make_dual` | Associates a tensor value with a forward gradient, the tangent, to create a "dual tensor", which is used to compute forward AD gradients.  
`forward_ad.unpack_dual` | Unpacks a "dual tensor" to get both its Tensor value and its forward AD gradient.  
## Functional higher level API

Warning

This API is in beta. Even though the function signatures are very unlikely to
change, major improvements to performances are planned before we consider this
stable.

This section contains the higher level API for the autograd that builds on the
basic API above and allows you to compute jacobians, hessians, etc.

This API works with user-provided functions that take only Tensors as input
and return only Tensors. If your function takes other arguments that are not
Tensors or Tensors that don’t have requires_grad set, you can use a lambda to
capture them. For example, for a function `f` that takes three inputs, a
Tensor for which we want the jacobian, another tensor that should be
considered constant and a boolean flag as `f(input, constant, flag=flag)` you
can use it as `functional.jacobian(lambda x: f(x, constant, flag=flag),
input)`.

`functional.jacobian` | Function that computes the Jacobian of a given function.  
---|---  
`functional.hessian` | Function that computes the Hessian of a given scalar function.  
`functional.vjp` | Function that computes the dot product between a vector `v` and the Jacobian of the given function at the point given by the inputs.  
`functional.jvp` | Function that computes the dot product between the Jacobian of the given function at the point given by the inputs and a vector `v`.  
`functional.vhp` | Function that computes the dot product between a vector `v` and the Hessian of a given scalar function at the point given by the inputs.  
`functional.hvp` | Function that computes the dot product between the Hessian of a given scalar function and a vector `v` at the point given by the inputs.  
## Locally disabling gradient computation

See Locally disabling gradient computation for more information on the
differences between no-grad and inference mode as well as other related
mechanisms that may be confused with the two. Also see Locally disabling
gradient computation for a list of functions that can be used to locally
disable gradients.

## Default gradient layouts

When a non-sparse `param` receives a non-sparse gradient during
`torch.autograd.backward()` or `torch.Tensor.backward()` `param.grad` is
accumulated as follows.

If `param.grad` is initially `None`:

  1. If `param`’s memory is non-overlapping and dense, `.grad` is created with strides matching `param` (thus matching `param`’s layout).
  2. Otherwise, `.grad` is created with rowmajor-contiguous strides.

If `param` already has a non-sparse `.grad` attribute:

  3. If `create_graph=False`, `backward()` accumulates into `.grad` in-place, which preserves its strides.
  4. If `create_graph=True`, `backward()` replaces `.grad` with a new tensor `.grad + new grad`, which attempts (but does not guarantee) matching the preexisting `.grad`’s strides.

The default behavior (letting `.grad`s be `None` before the first
`backward()`, such that their layout is created according to 1 or 2, and
retained over time according to 3 or 4) is recommended for best performance.
Calls to `model.zero_grad()` or `optimizer.zero_grad()` will not affect
`.grad` layouts.

In fact, resetting all `.grad`s to `None` before each accumulation phase,
e.g.:

    
    for iterations...
        ...
        for param in model.parameters():
            param.grad = None
        loss.backward()
    
such that they’re recreated according to 1 or 2 every time, is a valid
alternative to `model.zero_grad()` or `optimizer.zero_grad()` that may improve
performance for some networks.

### Manual gradient layouts

If you need manual control over `.grad`’s strides, assign `param.grad =` a
zeroed tensor with desired strides before the first `backward()`, and never
reset it to `None`. 3 guarantees your layout is preserved as long as
`create_graph=False`. 4 indicates your layout is likely preserved even if
`create_graph=True`.

## In-place operations on Tensors

Supporting in-place operations in autograd is a hard matter, and we discourage
their use in most cases. Autograd’s aggressive buffer freeing and reuse makes
it very efficient and there are very few occasions when in-place operations
actually lower memory usage by any significant amount. Unless you’re operating
under heavy memory pressure, you might never need to use them.

### In-place correctness checks

All `Tensor` s keep track of in-place operations applied to them, and if the
implementation detects that a tensor was saved for backward in one of the
functions, but it was modified in-place afterwards, an error will be raised
once backward pass is started. This ensures that if you’re using in-place
functions and not seeing any errors, you can be sure that the computed
gradients are correct.

## Variable (deprecated)

Warning

The Variable API has been deprecated: Variables are no longer necessary to use
autograd with tensors. Autograd automatically supports Tensors with
`requires_grad` set to `True`. Below please find a quick guide on what has
changed:

  * `Variable(tensor)` and `Variable(tensor, requires_grad)` still work as expected, but they return Tensors instead of Variables.
  * `var.data` is the same thing as `tensor.data`.
  * Methods such as `var.backward(), var.detach(), var.register_hook()` now work on tensors with the same method names.

In addition, one can now create tensors with `requires_grad=True` using
factory methods such as `torch.randn()`, `torch.zeros()`, `torch.ones()`, and
others like the following:

`autograd_tensor = torch.randn((2, 3, 4), requires_grad=True)`

## Tensor autograd functions

`torch.Tensor.grad` | This attribute is `None` by default and becomes a Tensor the first time a call to `backward()` computes gradients for `self`.  
---|---  
`torch.Tensor.requires_grad` | Is `True` if gradients need to be computed for this Tensor, `False` otherwise.  
`torch.Tensor.is_leaf` | All Tensors that have `requires_grad` which is `False` will be leaf Tensors by convention.  
`torch.Tensor.backward`([gradient, ...]) | Computes the gradient of current tensor wrt graph leaves.  
`torch.Tensor.detach` | Returns a new Tensor, detached from the current graph.  
`torch.Tensor.detach_` | Detaches the Tensor from the graph that created it, making it a leaf.  
`torch.Tensor.register_hook`(hook) | Registers a backward hook.  
`torch.Tensor.register_post_accumulate_grad_hook`(hook) | Registers a backward hook that runs after grad accumulation.  
`torch.Tensor.retain_grad`() | Enables this Tensor to have their `grad` populated during `backward()`.  
## Function

`class torch.autograd.Function(*args, **kwargs)` [source]

    
Base class to create custom `autograd.Function`

To create a custom `autograd.Function`, subclass this class and implement the
`forward()` and `backward()` static methods. Then, to use your custom op in
the forward pass, call the class method `apply`. Do not call `forward()`
directly.

To ensure correctness and best performance, make sure you are calling the
correct methods on `ctx` and validating your backward function using
`torch.autograd.gradcheck()`.

See Extending torch.autograd for more details on how to use this class.

Examples:

    
    >>> class Exp(Function):
    >>>     @staticmethod
    >>>     def forward(ctx, i):
    >>>         result = i.exp()
    >>>         ctx.save_for_backward(result)
    >>>         return result
    >>>
    >>>     @staticmethod
    >>>     def backward(ctx, grad_output):
    >>>         result, = ctx.saved_tensors
    >>>         return grad_output * result
    >>>
    >>> # Use it by calling the apply method:
    >>> output = Exp.apply(input)
    
`Function.forward` | This function is to be overridden by all subclasses.  
---|---  
`Function.backward` | Defines a formula for differentiating the operation with backward mode automatic differentiation (alias to the vjp function).  
`Function.jvp` | Defines a formula for differentiating the operation with forward mode automatic differentiation.  
`Function.vmap` | Defines a rule for the behavior of this autograd.Function underneath `torch.vmap()`.  
## Context method mixins

When creating a new `Function`, the following methods are available to `ctx`.

`function.FunctionCtx.mark_dirty` | Marks given tensors as modified in an in-place operation.  
---|---  
`function.FunctionCtx.mark_non_differentiable` | Marks outputs as non-differentiable.  
`function.FunctionCtx.save_for_backward` | Saves given tensors for a future call to `backward()`.  
`function.FunctionCtx.set_materialize_grads` | Sets whether to materialize grad tensors.  
## Numerical gradient checking

`gradcheck` | Check gradients computed via small finite differences against analytical gradients wrt tensors in `inputs` that are of floating point or complex type and with `requires_grad=True`.  
---|---  
`gradgradcheck` | Check gradients of gradients computed via small finite differences against analytical gradients wrt tensors in `inputs` and `grad_outputs` that are of floating point or complex type and with `requires_grad=True`.  
## Profiler

Autograd includes a profiler that lets you inspect the cost of different
operators inside your model - both on the CPU and GPU. There are three modes
implemented at the moment - CPU-only using `profile`. nvprof based (registers
both CPU and GPU activity) using `emit_nvtx`. and vtune profiler based using
`emit_itt`.

`class torch.autograd.profiler.profile(enabled=True, *, use_cuda=False,
use_device=None, record_shapes=False, with_flops=False, profile_memory=False,
with_stack=False, with_modules=False, use_kineto=False, use_cpu=True,
use_mtia=False, experimental_config=None)` [source]

    
Context manager that manages autograd profiler state and holds a summary of
results. Under the hood it just records events of functions being executed in
C++ and exposes those events to Python. You can wrap any code into it and it
will only report runtime of PyTorch functions. Note: profiler is thread local
and is automatically propagated into the async tasks

Parameters

    
  * enabled (bool, optional) – Setting this to False makes this context manager a no-op.
  * use_cuda (bool, optional) – Enables timing of CUDA events as well using the cudaEvent API. Adds approximately 4us of overhead to each tensor operation.
  * record_shapes (bool, optional) – If shapes recording is set, information about input dimensions will be collected. This allows one to see which dimensions have been used under the hood and further group by them using prof.key_averages(group_by_input_shape=True). Please note that shape recording might skew your profiling data. It is recommended to use separate runs with and without shape recording to validate the timing. Most likely the skew will be negligible for bottom most events (in a case of nested function calls). But for higher level functions the total self cpu time might be artificially increased because of the shape collection.
  * with_flops (bool, optional) – If with_flops is set, the profiler will estimate the FLOPs (floating point operations) value using the operator’s input shape. This allows one to estimate the hardware performance. Currently, this option only works for the matrix multiplication and 2D convolution operators.
  * profile_memory (bool, optional) – track tensor memory allocation/deallocation.
  * with_stack (bool, optional) – record source information (file and line number) for the ops.
  * with_modules (bool) – record module hierarchy (including function names) corresponding to the callstack of the op. e.g. If module A’s forward call’s module B’s forward which contains an aten::add op, then aten::add’s module hierarchy is A.B Note that this support exist, at the moment, only for TorchScript models and not eager mode models.
  * use_kineto (bool, optional) – experimental, enable profiling with Kineto profiler.
  * use_cpu (bool, optional) – profile CPU events; setting to `False` requires `use_kineto=True` and can be used to lower the overhead for GPU-only profiling.
  * experimental_config (_ExperimentalConfig) – A set of experimental options used by profiler libraries like Kineto. Note, backward compatibility is not guaranteed.

#### Example

    
    >>> x = torch.randn((1, 1), requires_grad=True)
    >>> with torch.autograd.profiler.profile() as prof:
    >>>     for _ in range(100):  # any normal python code, really!
    >>>         y = x ** 2
    >>>         y.backward()
    >>> # NOTE: some columns were removed for brevity

`class torch.autograd.profiler.emit_nvtx(enabled=True, record_shapes=False)`
[source]

    
Context manager that makes every autograd operation emit an NVTX range.

It is useful when running the program under nvprof:

    
    nvprof --profile-from-start off -o trace_name.prof -- <regular command here>
    
Unfortunately, there’s no way to force nvprof to flush the data it collected
to disk, so for CUDA profiling one has to use this context manager to annotate
nvprof traces and wait for the process to exit before inspecting them. Then,
either NVIDIA Visual Profiler (nvvp) can be used to visualize the timeline, or
`torch.autograd.profiler.load_nvprof()` can load the results for inspection
e.g. in Python REPL.

Parameters

    
  * enabled (bool, optional) – Setting `enabled=False` makes this context manager a no-op. Default: `True`.
  * record_shapes (bool, optional) – If `record_shapes=True`, the nvtx range wrapping each autograd op will append information about the sizes of Tensor arguments received by that op, in the following format: `[[arg0.size(0), arg0.size(1), ...], [arg1.size(0), arg1.size(1), ...], ...]` Non-tensor arguments will be represented by `[]`. Arguments will be listed in the order they are received by the backend op. Please note that this order may not match the order in which those arguments were passed on the Python side. Also note that shape recording may increase the overhead of nvtx range creation. Default: `False`

#### Example

    
    >>> with torch.cuda.profiler.profile():
    ...     model(x)  # Warmup CUDA memory allocator and profiler
    ...     with torch.autograd.profiler.emit_nvtx():
    ...         model(x)
    
Forward-backward correlation

When viewing a profile created using `emit_nvtx` in the Nvidia Visual
Profiler, correlating each backward-pass op with the corresponding forward-
pass op can be difficult. To ease this task, `emit_nvtx` appends sequence
number information to the ranges it generates.

During the forward pass, each function range is decorated with `seq=<N>`.
`seq` is a running counter, incremented each time a new backward Function
object is created and stashed for backward. Thus, the `seq=<N>` annotation
associated with each forward function range tells you that if a backward
Function object is created by this forward function, the backward object will
receive sequence number N. During the backward pass, the top-level range
wrapping each C++ backward Function’s `apply()` call is decorated with
`stashed seq=<M>`. `M` is the sequence number that the backward object was
created with. By comparing `stashed seq` numbers in backward with `seq`
numbers in forward, you can track down which forward op created each backward
Function.

Any functions executed during the backward pass are also decorated with
`seq=<N>`. During default backward (with `create_graph=False`) this
information is irrelevant, and in fact, `N` may simply be 0 for all such
functions. Only the top-level ranges associated with backward Function
objects’ `apply()` methods are useful, as a way to correlate these Function
objects with the earlier forward pass.

Double-backward

If, on the other hand, a backward pass with `create_graph=True` is underway
(in other words, if you are setting up for a double-backward), each function’s
execution during backward is given a nonzero, useful `seq=<N>`. Those
functions may themselves create Function objects to be executed later during
double-backward, just as the original functions in the forward pass did. The
relationship between backward and double-backward is conceptually the same as
the relationship between forward and backward: The functions still emit
current-sequence-number-tagged ranges, the Function objects they create still
stash those sequence numbers, and during the eventual double-backward, the
Function objects’ `apply()` ranges are still tagged with `stashed seq`
numbers, which can be compared to `seq` numbers from the backward pass.

`class torch.autograd.profiler.emit_itt(enabled=True, record_shapes=False)`
[source]

    
Context manager that makes every autograd operation emit an ITT range.

It is useful when running the program under Intel(R) VTune Profiler:

    
    vtune <--vtune-flags> <regular command here>
    
The Instrumentation and Tracing Technology (ITT) API enables your application
to generate and control the collection of trace data during its execution
across different Intel tools. This context manager is to annotate Intel(R)
VTune Profiling trace. With help of this context manager, you will be able to
see labled ranges in Intel(R) VTune Profiler GUI.

Parameters

    
  * enabled (bool, optional) – Setting `enabled=False` makes this context manager a no-op. Default: `True`.
  * record_shapes (bool, optional) – If `record_shapes=True`, the itt range wrapping each autograd op will append information about the sizes of Tensor arguments received by that op, in the following format: `[[arg0.size(0), arg0.size(1), ...], [arg1.size(0), arg1.size(1), ...], ...]` Non-tensor arguments will be represented by `[]`. Arguments will be listed in the order they are received by the backend op. Please note that this order may not match the order in which those arguments were passed on the Python side. Also note that shape recording may increase the overhead of itt range creation. Default: `False`

#### Example

    
    >>> with torch.autograd.profiler.emit_itt():
    ...     model(x)
    
`profiler.load_nvprof` | Opens an nvprof trace file and parses autograd annotations.  
---|---  
## Anomaly detection

`class torch.autograd.detect_anomaly(check_nan=True)` [source]

    
Context-manager that enable anomaly detection for the autograd engine.

This does two things:

  * Running the forward pass with detection enabled will allow the backward pass to print the traceback of the forward operation that created the failing backward function.
  * If `check_nan` is `True`, any backward computation that generate “nan” value will raise an error. Default `True`.

Warning

This mode should be enabled only for debugging as the different tests will
slow down your program execution.

#### Example

    
    >>> import torch
    >>> from torch import autograd
    >>> class MyFunc(autograd.Function):
    ...     @staticmethod
    ...     def forward(ctx, inp):

`class torch.autograd.set_detect_anomaly(mode, check_nan=True)` [source]

    
Context-manager that sets the anomaly detection for the autograd engine on or
off.

`set_detect_anomaly` will enable or disable the autograd anomaly detection
based on its argument `mode`. It can be used as a context-manager or as a
function.

See `detect_anomaly` above for details of the anomaly detection behaviour.

Parameters

    
  * mode (bool) – Flag whether to enable anomaly detection (`True`), or disable (`False`).
  * check_nan (bool) – Flag whether to raise an error when the backward generate “nan”

## Autograd graph

Autograd exposes methods that allow one to inspect the graph and interpose
behavior during the backward pass.

The `grad_fn` attribute of a `torch.Tensor` holds a
`torch.autograd.graph.Node` if the tensor is the output of a operation that
was recorded by autograd (i.e., grad_mode is enabled and at least one of the
inputs required gradients), or `None` otherwise.

`graph.Node.name` | Returns the name.  
---|---  
`graph.Node.metadata` | Returns the metadata.  
`graph.Node.next_functions` |   
`graph.Node.register_hook` | Registers a backward hook.  
`graph.Node.register_prehook` | Registers a backward pre-hook.  
Some operations need intermediary results to be saved during the forward pass
in order to execute the backward pass. These intermediary results are saved as
attributes on the `grad_fn` and can be accessed. For example:

    
    >>> a = torch.tensor([0., 0., 0.], requires_grad=True)
    >>> b = a.exp()
    >>> print(isinstance(b.grad_fn, torch.autograd.graph.Node))
    True
    >>> print(dir(b.grad_fn))
    ['__call__', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '_raw_saved_result', '_register_hook_dict', '_saved_result', 'metadata', 'name', 'next_functions', 'register_hook', 'register_prehook', 'requires_grad']
    >>> print(torch.allclose(b.grad_fn._saved_result, b))
    True
    
You can also define how these saved tensors should be packed / unpacked using
hooks. A common application is to trade compute for memory by saving those
intermediary results to disk or to CPU instead of leaving them on the GPU.
This is especially useful if you notice your model fits on GPU during
evaluation, but not training. Also see Hooks for saved tensors.

`class torch.autograd.graph.saved_tensors_hooks(pack_hook, unpack_hook)`
[source]

    
Context-manager that sets a pair of pack / unpack hooks for saved tensors.

Use this context-manager to define how intermediary results of an operation
should be packed before saving, and unpacked on retrieval.

In that context, the `pack_hook` function will be called everytime an
operation saves a tensor for backward (this includes intermediary results
saved using `save_for_backward()` but also those recorded by a PyTorch-defined
operation). The output of `pack_hook` is then stored in the computation graph
instead of the original tensor.

The `unpack_hook` is called when the saved tensor needs to be accessed, namely
when executing `torch.Tensor.backward()` or `torch.autograd.grad()`. It takes
as argument the packed object returned by `pack_hook` and should return a
tensor which has the same content as the original tensor (passed as input to
the corresponding `pack_hook`).

The hooks should have the following signatures:

pack_hook(tensor: Tensor) -> Any

unpack_hook(Any) -> Tensor

where the return value of `pack_hook` is a valid input to `unpack_hook`.

In general, you want `unpack_hook(pack_hook(t))` to be equal to `t` in terms
of value, size, dtype and device.

Example:

    
    >>> def pack_hook(x):
    ...     print("Packing", x)
    ...     return x
    >>>
    >>> def unpack_hook(x):
    ...     print("Unpacking", x)

Warning

Performing an inplace operation on the input to either hooks may lead to
undefined behavior.

Warning

Only one pair of hooks is allowed at a time. When recursively nesting this
context-manager, only the inner-most pair of hooks will be applied.

`class torch.autograd.graph.save_on_cpu(pin_memory=False, device_type='cuda')`
[source]

    
Context-manager under which tensors saved by the forward pass will be stored
on cpu, then retrieved for backward.

When performing operations within this context manager, intermediary results
saved in the graph during the forward pass will be moved to CPU, then copied
back to the original device when needed for the backward pass. If the graph
was already on CPU, no tensor copy is performed.

Use this context-manager to trade compute for GPU memory usage (e.g. when your
model doesn’t fit in GPU memory during training).

Parameters

    
pin_memory (bool) – If `True` tensors will be saved to CPU pinned memory
during packing and copied to GPU asynchronously during unpacking. Defaults to
`False`. Also see Use pinned memory buffers.

Example:

    
    >>> a = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True, device="cuda")
    >>> b = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True, device="cuda")
    >>> c = torch.randn(5, requires_grad=True, device="cuda")
    >>>
    >>> def f(a, b, c):
    ...     prod_1 = a * b           # a and b are saved on GPU
    ...     with torch.autograd.graph.save_on_cpu():
    ...         prod_2 = prod_1 * c  # prod_1 and c are saved on CPU
    ...     y = prod_2 * a           # prod_2 and a are saved on GPU
    ...     return y
    >>>
    >>> y = f(a, b, c)
    >>> del a, b, c  # for illustration only
    >>> # the content of a, b, and prod_2 are still alive on GPU
    >>> # the content of prod_1 and c only live on CPU
    >>> y.sum().backward()  # all CPU tensors are moved back to GPU, for backward
    >>> # all intermediary tensors are released (deleted) after the call to backward
    
`class torch.autograd.graph.disable_saved_tensors_hooks(error_message)`
[source]

    
Context-manager that disables the saved tensors default hooks feature.

Useful for if you are creating a feature that does not work with saved tensors
default hooks.

Parameters

    
error_message (str) – When saved tensors default hooks are used when they have
been are disabled, a RuntimeError with this error message gets raised.

Example:

    
    >>> message = "saved tensors default hooks are disabled"
    >>> with torch.autograd.graph.disable_saved_tensors_hooks(message):
    ...     # Raises RuntimeError: saved tensors default hooks are disabled
    ...     with torch.autograd.graph.save_on_cpu():
    ...         pass
    
`class torch.autograd.graph.register_multi_grad_hook(tensors, fn)` [source]

    
Registers a multi-grad backward hook.

The hook will be called after gradients with respect to every tensor in
`tensors` have been computed. If a tensor is in `tensors` but is not part of
the graph, or if a tensor is not needed to compute the gradients for any
`inputs` specified for the current `.backward()` or `.grad()` call, this
tensor will be ignored and the hook will not wait for its gradient to be
computed.

After every non-ignored tensor’s gradient has been computed, `fn` will be
called with those gradients. `None` will be passed for tensors that did not
have their gradients computed.

The hook should not modify its arguments.

This function returns a handle with a method `handle.remove()` that removes
the hook.

Note

See Backward Hooks execution for more information on how when this hook is
executed, and how its execution is ordered relative to other hooks.

Example:

    
    >>> import torch
    >>>
    >>> a = torch.rand(2, 3, requires_grad=True)
    >>> b = torch.rand(2, 3, requires_grad=True)
    >>> c = a * b
    >>> d = a * b
    >>>
    >>> def fn(grads):
    ...     print([g is not None for g in grads])
    ...
    >>> torch.autograd.graph.register_multi_grad_hook((a, b, c, d), fn)
    >>>
    >>> c.sum().backward(retain_graph=True)
    [True, True, True, False]
    >>> c.sum().backward(inputs=(a,), retain_graph=True)
    [True, False, True, False]
    >>>
    
`class torch.autograd.graph.allow_mutation_on_saved_tensors` [source]

    
Context manager under which mutating tensors saved for backward is allowed

Under this context manager, tensors saved for backward are cloned on mutation,
so the original version can still be used during backward. Normally, mutating
a tensor saved for backward will result in an error raised when it’s used
during backward.

To ensure the correct behavior, both the forward and backward should be run
under the same context manager.

Returns

    
An _AllowMutationOnSavedContext object storing the state managed by this
context manager. This object can be useful for debugging purposes. The state
managed by the context manager is automatically cleared upon exiting.

Example:

    
    >>> import torch
    >>> with torch.autograd.graph.allow_mutation_on_saved_tensors():
    ...     # forward
    ...     a = torch.ones(2, 3, requires_grad=True)
    ...     b = a.clone()
    ...     out = (b**2).sum()
    ...     b.sin_()
    ...     # backward
    ...     out.sum().backward()
    ...
    tensor([[0.8415, 0.8415, 0.8415],
            [0.8415, 0.8415, 0.8415]], grad_fn=<SinBackward0>)
