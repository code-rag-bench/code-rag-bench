# Automatic Mixed Precision package - torch.amp

`torch.amp` provides convenience methods for mixed precision, where some
operations use the `torch.float32` (`float`) datatype and other operations use
lower precision floating point datatype (`lower_precision_fp`):
`torch.float16` (`half`) or `torch.bfloat16`. Some ops, like linear layers and
convolutions, are much faster in `lower_precision_fp`. Other ops, like
reductions, often require the dynamic range of `float32`. Mixed precision
tries to match each op to its appropriate datatype.

Ordinarily, “automatic mixed precision training” with datatype of
`torch.float16` uses `torch.autocast` and `torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler`
together, as shown in the CUDA Automatic Mixed Precision examples and CUDA
Automatic Mixed Precision recipe. However, `torch.autocast` and
`torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler` are modular, and may be used separately if
desired. As shown in the CPU example section of `torch.autocast`, “automatic
mixed precision training/inference” on CPU with datatype of `torch.bfloat16`
only uses `torch.autocast`.

For CUDA and CPU, APIs are also provided separately:

  * `torch.autocast("cuda", args...)` is equivalent to `torch.cuda.amp.autocast(args...)`.
  * `torch.autocast("cpu", args...)` is equivalent to `torch.cpu.amp.autocast(args...)`. For CPU, only lower precision floating point datatype of `torch.bfloat16` is supported for now.

`torch.autocast` and `torch.cpu.amp.autocast` are new in version `1.10`.

## Autocasting

`class torch.autocast(device_type, dtype=None, enabled=True,
cache_enabled=None)` [source]

    
Instances of `autocast` serve as context managers or decorators that allow
regions of your script to run in mixed precision.

In these regions, ops run in an op-specific dtype chosen by autocast to
improve performance while maintaining accuracy. See the Autocast Op Reference
for details.

When entering an autocast-enabled region, Tensors may be any type. You should
not call `half()` or `bfloat16()` on your model(s) or inputs when using
autocasting.

`autocast` should wrap only the forward pass(es) of your network, including
the loss computation(s). Backward passes under autocast are not recommended.
Backward ops run in the same type that autocast used for corresponding forward
ops.

Example for CUDA Devices:

    
    # Creates model and optimizer in default precision
    model = Net().cuda()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), ...)
    
    for input, target in data:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
    
        # Enables autocasting for the forward pass (model + loss)
        with torch.autocast(device_type="cuda"):
            output = model(input)
            loss = loss_fn(output, target)
    
        # Exits the context manager before backward()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    
See the CUDA Automatic Mixed Precision examples for usage (along with gradient
scaling) in more complex scenarios (e.g., gradient penalty, multiple
models/losses, custom autograd functions).

`autocast` can also be used as a decorator, e.g., on the `forward` method of
your model:

    
    class AutocastModel(nn.Module):
        ...
        @torch.autocast(device_type="cuda")
        def forward(self, input):
            ...
    
Floating-point Tensors produced in an autocast-enabled region may be
`float16`. After returning to an autocast-disabled region, using them with
floating-point Tensors of different dtypes may cause type mismatch errors. If
so, cast the Tensor(s) produced in the autocast region back to `float32` (or
other dtype if desired). If a Tensor from the autocast region is already
`float32`, the cast is a no-op, and incurs no additional overhead. CUDA
Example:

    
    # Creates some tensors in default dtype (here assumed to be float32)
    a_float32 = torch.rand((8, 8), device="cuda")
    b_float32 = torch.rand((8, 8), device="cuda")
    c_float32 = torch.rand((8, 8), device="cuda")
    d_float32 = torch.rand((8, 8), device="cuda")
    
    with torch.autocast(device_type="cuda"):
        # torch.mm is on autocast's list of ops that should run in float16.
        # Inputs are float32, but the op runs in float16 and produces float16 output.
        # No manual casts are required.
        e_float16 = torch.mm(a_float32, b_float32)
        # Also handles mixed input types
        f_float16 = torch.mm(d_float32, e_float16)
    
    # After exiting autocast, calls f_float16.float() to use with d_float32
    g_float32 = torch.mm(d_float32, f_float16.float())
    
CPU Training Example:

    
    # Creates model and optimizer in default precision
    model = Net()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), ...)
    
    for epoch in epochs:
        for input, target in data:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
    
            # Runs the forward pass with autocasting.
            with torch.autocast(device_type="cpu", dtype=torch.bfloat16):
                output = model(input)
                loss = loss_fn(output, target)
    
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
    
CPU Inference Example:

    
    # Creates model in default precision
    model = Net().eval()
    
    with torch.autocast(device_type="cpu", dtype=torch.bfloat16):
        for input in data:
            # Runs the forward pass with autocasting.
            output = model(input)
    
CPU Inference Example with Jit Trace:

    
    class TestModel(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, input_size, num_classes):
            super().__init__()
            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, num_classes)
        def forward(self, x):
            return self.fc1(x)
    
    input_size = 2
    num_classes = 2
    model = TestModel(input_size, num_classes).eval()
    
    # For now, we suggest to disable the Jit Autocast Pass,
    # As the issue: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/75956
    torch._C._jit_set_autocast_mode(False)
    
    with torch.cpu.amp.autocast(cache_enabled=False):
        model = torch.jit.trace(model, torch.randn(1, input_size))
    model = torch.jit.freeze(model)
    # Models Run
    for _ in range(3):
        model(torch.randn(1, input_size))
    
Type mismatch errors in an autocast-enabled region are a bug; if this is what
you observe, please file an issue.

`autocast(enabled=False)` subregions can be nested in autocast-enabled
regions. Locally disabling autocast can be useful, for example, if you want to
force a subregion to run in a particular `dtype`. Disabling autocast gives you
explicit control over the execution type. In the subregion, inputs from the
surrounding region should be cast to `dtype` before use:

    
    # Creates some tensors in default dtype (here assumed to be float32)
    a_float32 = torch.rand((8, 8), device="cuda")
    b_float32 = torch.rand((8, 8), device="cuda")
    c_float32 = torch.rand((8, 8), device="cuda")
    d_float32 = torch.rand((8, 8), device="cuda")
    
    with torch.autocast(device_type="cuda"):
        e_float16 = torch.mm(a_float32, b_float32)
        with torch.autocast(device_type="cuda", enabled=False):
            # Calls e_float16.float() to ensure float32 execution
            # (necessary because e_float16 was created in an autocasted region)
            f_float32 = torch.mm(c_float32, e_float16.float())
    
        # No manual casts are required when re-entering the autocast-enabled region.
        # torch.mm again runs in float16 and produces float16 output, regardless of input types.
        g_float16 = torch.mm(d_float32, f_float32)
    
The autocast state is thread-local. If you want it enabled in a new thread,
the context manager or decorator must be invoked in that thread. This affects
`torch.nn.DataParallel` and `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` when
used with more than one GPU per process (see Working with Multiple GPUs).

Parameters

    
  * device_type (str, required) – Device type to use. Possible values are: ‘cuda’, ‘cpu’, ‘xpu’ and ‘hpu’. The type is the same as the `type` attribute of a `torch.device`. Thus, you may obtain the device type of a tensor using `Tensor.device.type`.
  * enabled (bool, optional) – Whether autocasting should be enabled in the region. Default: `True`
  * dtype (torch_dtype, optional) – Whether to use torch.float16 or torch.bfloat16.
  * cache_enabled (bool, optional) – Whether the weight cache inside autocast should be enabled. Default: `True`

`class torch.cuda.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch.float16,
cache_enabled=True)` [source]

    
See `torch.autocast`. `torch.cuda.amp.autocast(args...)` is equivalent to
`torch.autocast("cuda", args...)`

`torch.cuda.amp.custom_fwd(fwd=None, *, cast_inputs=None)` [source]

    
Helper decorator for `forward` methods of custom autograd functions
(subclasses of `torch.autograd.Function`). See the example page for more
detail.

Parameters

    
cast_inputs (`torch.dtype` or None, optional, default=None) – If not `None`,
when `forward` runs in an autocast-enabled region, casts incoming floating-
point CUDA Tensors to the target dtype (non-floating-point Tensors are not
affected), then executes `forward` with autocast disabled. If `None`,
`forward`’s internal ops execute with the current autocast state.

Note

If the decorated `forward` is called outside an autocast-enabled region,
`custom_fwd` is a no-op and `cast_inputs` has no effect.

`torch.cuda.amp.custom_bwd(bwd)` [source]

    
Helper decorator for backward methods of custom autograd functions (subclasses
of `torch.autograd.Function`). Ensures that `backward` executes with the same
autocast state as `forward`. See the example page for more detail.

`class torch.cpu.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch.bfloat16,
cache_enabled=True)` [source]

    
See `torch.autocast`. `torch.cpu.amp.autocast(args...)` is equivalent to
`torch.autocast("cpu", args...)`

## Gradient Scaling

If the forward pass for a particular op has `float16` inputs, the backward
pass for that op will produce `float16` gradients. Gradient values with small
magnitudes may not be representable in `float16`. These values will flush to
zero (“underflow”), so the update for the corresponding parameters will be
lost.

To prevent underflow, “gradient scaling” multiplies the network’s loss(es) by
a scale factor and invokes a backward pass on the scaled loss(es). Gradients
flowing backward through the network are then scaled by the same factor. In
other words, gradient values have a larger magnitude, so they don’t flush to
zero.

Each parameter’s gradient (`.grad` attribute) should be unscaled before the
optimizer updates the parameters, so the scale factor does not interfere with
the learning rate.

Note

AMP/fp16 may not work for every model! For example, most bf16-pretrained
models cannot operate in the fp16 numerical range of max 65504 and will cause
gradients to overflow instead of underflow. In this case, the scale factor may
decrease under 1 as an attempt to bring gradients to a number representable in
the fp16 dynamic range. While one may expect the scale to always be above 1,
our GradScaler does NOT make this guarantee to maintain performance. If you
encounter NaNs in your loss or gradients when running with AMP/fp16, verify
your model is compatible.

`class torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler(init_scale=65536.0, growth_factor=2.0,
backoff_factor=0.5, growth_interval=2000, enabled=True)` [source]

    
`get_backoff_factor()` [source]

    
Returns a Python float containing the scale backoff factor.

`get_growth_factor()` [source]

    
Returns a Python float containing the scale growth factor.

`get_growth_interval()` [source]

    
Returns a Python int containing the growth interval.

`get_scale()` [source]

    
Returns a Python float containing the current scale, or 1.0 if scaling is
disabled.

Warning

`get_scale()` incurs a CPU-GPU sync.

`is_enabled()` [source]

    
Returns a bool indicating whether this instance is enabled.

`load_state_dict(state_dict)` [source]

    
Loads the scaler state. If this instance is disabled, `load_state_dict()` is a
no-op.

Parameters

    
state_dict (dict) – scaler state. Should be an object returned from a call to
`state_dict()`.

`scale(outputs)` [source]

    
Multiplies (‘scales’) a tensor or list of tensors by the scale factor.

Returns scaled outputs. If this instance of `GradScaler` is not enabled,
outputs are returned unmodified.

Parameters

    
outputs (Tensor or iterable of Tensors) – Outputs to scale.

`set_backoff_factor(new_factor)` [source]

    
Parameters

    
new_scale (float) – Value to use as the new scale backoff factor.

`set_growth_factor(new_factor)` [source]

    
Parameters

    
new_scale (float) – Value to use as the new scale growth factor.

`set_growth_interval(new_interval)` [source]

    
Parameters

    
new_interval (int) – Value to use as the new growth interval.

`state_dict()` [source]

    
Returns the state of the scaler as a `dict`. It contains five entries:

  * `"scale"` \- a Python float containing the current scale
  * `"growth_factor"` \- a Python float containing the current growth factor
  * `"backoff_factor"` \- a Python float containing the current backoff factor
  * `"growth_interval"` \- a Python int containing the current growth interval
  * `"_growth_tracker"` \- a Python int containing the number of recent consecutive unskipped steps.

If this instance is not enabled, returns an empty dict.

Note

If you wish to checkpoint the scaler’s state after a particular iteration,
`state_dict()` should be called after `update()`.

`step(optimizer, *args, **kwargs)` [source]

    
`step()` carries out the following two operations:

  1. Internally invokes `unscale_(optimizer)` (unless `unscale_()` was explicitly called for `optimizer` earlier in the iteration). As part of the `unscale_()`, gradients are checked for infs/NaNs.
  2. If no inf/NaN gradients are found, invokes `optimizer.step()` using the unscaled gradients. Otherwise, `optimizer.step()` is skipped to avoid corrupting the params.

`*args` and `**kwargs` are forwarded to `optimizer.step()`.

Returns the return value of `optimizer.step(*args, **kwargs)`.

Parameters

    
  * optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer) – Optimizer that applies the gradients.
  * args – Any arguments.
  * kwargs – Any keyword arguments.

Warning

Closure use is not currently supported.

`unscale_(optimizer)` [source]

    
Divides (“unscales”) the optimizer’s gradient tensors by the scale factor.

`unscale_()` is optional, serving cases where you need to modify or inspect
gradients between the backward pass(es) and `step()`. If `unscale_()` is not
called explicitly, gradients will be unscaled automatically during `step()`.

Simple example, using `unscale_()` to enable clipping of unscaled gradients:

    
    ...
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.unscale_(optimizer)
    torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm)
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
    
Parameters

    
optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer) – Optimizer that owns the gradients to be
unscaled.

Note

`unscale_()` does not incur a CPU-GPU sync.

Warning

`unscale_()` should only be called once per optimizer per `step()` call, and
only after all gradients for that optimizer’s assigned parameters have been
accumulated. Calling `unscale_()` twice for a given optimizer between each
`step()` triggers a RuntimeError.

Warning

`unscale_()` may unscale sparse gradients out of place, replacing the `.grad`
attribute.

`update(new_scale=None)` [source]

    
Updates the scale factor.

If any optimizer steps were skipped the scale is multiplied by
`backoff_factor` to reduce it. If `growth_interval` unskipped iterations
occurred consecutively, the scale is multiplied by `growth_factor` to increase
it.

Passing `new_scale` sets the new scale value manually. (`new_scale` is not
used directly, it’s used to fill GradScaler’s internal scale tensor. So if
`new_scale` was a tensor, later in-place changes to that tensor will not
further affect the scale GradScaler uses internally.)

Parameters

    
new_scale (float or `torch.cuda.FloatTensor`, optional, default=None) – New
scale factor.

Warning

`update()` should only be called at the end of the iteration, after
`scaler.step(optimizer)` has been invoked for all optimizers used this
iteration.

Warning

For performance reasons, we do not check the scale factor value to avoid
synchronizations, so the scale factor is not guaranteed to be above 1. If the
scale falls below 1 and/or you are seeing NaNs in your gradients or loss,
something is likely wrong. For example, bf16-pretrained models are often
incompatible with AMP/fp16 due to differing dynamic ranges.

## Autocast Op Reference

### Op Eligibility

Ops that run in `float64` or non-floating-point dtypes are not eligible, and
will run in these types whether or not autocast is enabled.

Only out-of-place ops and Tensor methods are eligible. In-place variants and
calls that explicitly supply an `out=...` Tensor are allowed in autocast-
enabled regions, but won’t go through autocasting. For example, in an
autocast-enabled region `a.addmm(b, c)` can autocast, but `a.addmm_(b, c)` and
`a.addmm(b, c, out=d)` cannot. For best performance and stability, prefer out-
of-place ops in autocast-enabled regions.

Ops called with an explicit `dtype=...` argument are not eligible, and will
produce output that respects the `dtype` argument.

### CUDA Op-Specific Behavior

The following lists describe the behavior of eligible ops in autocast-enabled
regions. These ops always go through autocasting whether they are invoked as
part of a `torch.nn.Module`, as a function, or as a `torch.Tensor` method. If
functions are exposed in multiple namespaces, they go through autocasting
regardless of the namespace.

Ops not listed below do not go through autocasting. They run in the type
defined by their inputs. However, autocasting may still change the type in
which unlisted ops run if they’re downstream from autocasted ops.

If an op is unlisted, we assume it’s numerically stable in `float16`. If you
believe an unlisted op is numerically unstable in `float16`, please file an
issue.

#### CUDA Ops that can autocast to `float16`

`__matmul__`, `addbmm`, `addmm`, `addmv`, `addr`, `baddbmm`, `bmm`,
`chain_matmul`, `multi_dot`, `conv1d`, `conv2d`, `conv3d`, `conv_transpose1d`,
`conv_transpose2d`, `conv_transpose3d`, `GRUCell`, `linear`, `LSTMCell`,
`matmul`, `mm`, `mv`, `prelu`, `RNNCell`

#### CUDA Ops that can autocast to `float32`

`__pow__`, `__rdiv__`, `__rpow__`, `__rtruediv__`, `acos`, `asin`,
`binary_cross_entropy_with_logits`, `cosh`, `cosine_embedding_loss`, `cdist`,
`cosine_similarity`, `cross_entropy`, `cumprod`, `cumsum`, `dist`, `erfinv`,
`exp`, `expm1`, `group_norm`, `hinge_embedding_loss`, `kl_div`, `l1_loss`,
`layer_norm`, `log`, `log_softmax`, `log10`, `log1p`, `log2`,
`margin_ranking_loss`, `mse_loss`, `multilabel_margin_loss`,
`multi_margin_loss`, `nll_loss`, `norm`, `normalize`, `pdist`,
`poisson_nll_loss`, `pow`, `prod`, `reciprocal`, `rsqrt`, `sinh`,
`smooth_l1_loss`, `soft_margin_loss`, `softmax`, `softmin`, `softplus`, `sum`,
`renorm`, `tan`, `triplet_margin_loss`

#### CUDA Ops that promote to the widest input type

These ops don’t require a particular dtype for stability, but take multiple
inputs and require that the inputs’ dtypes match. If all of the inputs are
`float16`, the op runs in `float16`. If any of the inputs is `float32`,
autocast casts all inputs to `float32` and runs the op in `float32`.

`addcdiv`, `addcmul`, `atan2`, `bilinear`, `cross`, `dot`, `grid_sample`,
`index_put`, `scatter_add`, `tensordot`

Some ops not listed here (e.g., binary ops like `add`) natively promote inputs
without autocasting’s intervention. If inputs are a mixture of `float16` and
`float32`, these ops run in `float32` and produce `float32` output, regardless
of whether autocast is enabled.

#### Prefer `binary_cross_entropy_with_logits` over `binary_cross_entropy`

The backward passes of `torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy()` (and
`torch.nn.BCELoss`, which wraps it) can produce gradients that aren’t
representable in `float16`. In autocast-enabled regions, the forward input may
be `float16`, which means the backward gradient must be representable in
`float16` (autocasting `float16` forward inputs to `float32` doesn’t help,
because that cast must be reversed in backward). Therefore,
`binary_cross_entropy` and `BCELoss` raise an error in autocast-enabled
regions.

Many models use a sigmoid layer right before the binary cross entropy layer.
In this case, combine the two layers using
`torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits()` or
`torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss`. `binary_cross_entropy_with_logits` and
`BCEWithLogits` are safe to autocast.

### CPU Op-Specific Behavior

The following lists describe the behavior of eligible ops in autocast-enabled
regions. These ops always go through autocasting whether they are invoked as
part of a `torch.nn.Module`, as a function, or as a `torch.Tensor` method. If
functions are exposed in multiple namespaces, they go through autocasting
regardless of the namespace.

Ops not listed below do not go through autocasting. They run in the type
defined by their inputs. However, autocasting may still change the type in
which unlisted ops run if they’re downstream from autocasted ops.

If an op is unlisted, we assume it’s numerically stable in `bfloat16`. If you
believe an unlisted op is numerically unstable in `bfloat16`, please file an
issue.

#### CPU Ops that can autocast to `bfloat16`

`conv1d`, `conv2d`, `conv3d`, `bmm`, `mm`, `baddbmm`, `addmm`, `addbmm`,
`linear`, `matmul`, `_convolution`

`multilabel_margin_loss_forward`, `linalg_qr`, `linalg_cholesky_ex`,
`linalg_svd`, `linalg_eig`, `linalg_eigh`, `linalg_lstsq`, `linalg_inv_ex`

#### CPU Ops that promote to the widest input type

These ops don’t require a particular dtype for stability, but take multiple
inputs and require that the inputs’ dtypes match. If all of the inputs are
`bfloat16`, the op runs in `bfloat16`. If any of the inputs is `float32`,
autocast casts all inputs to `float32` and runs the op in `float32`.

`cat`, `stack`, `index_copy`

Some ops not listed here (e.g., binary ops like `add`) natively promote inputs
without autocasting’s intervention. If inputs are a mixture of `bfloat16` and
`float32`, these ops run in `float32` and produce `float32` output, regardless
of whether autocast is enabled.
