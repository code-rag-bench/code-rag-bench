# signal — Set handlers for asynchronous events

This module provides mechanisms to use signal handlers in Python.

## General rules

The `signal.signal()` function allows defining custom handlers to be executed
when a signal is received. A small number of default handlers are installed:
`SIGPIPE` is ignored (so write errors on pipes and sockets can be reported as
ordinary Python exceptions) and `SIGINT` is translated into a
`KeyboardInterrupt` exception if the parent process has not changed it.

A handler for a particular signal, once set, remains installed until it is
explicitly reset (Python emulates the BSD style interface regardless of the
underlying implementation), with the exception of the handler for `SIGCHLD`,
which follows the underlying implementation.

### Execution of Python signal handlers

A Python signal handler does not get executed inside the low-level (C) signal
handler. Instead, the low-level signal handler sets a flag which tells the
virtual machine to execute the corresponding Python signal handler at a later
point(for example at the next bytecode instruction). This has consequences:

  * It makes little sense to catch synchronous errors like `SIGFPE` or `SIGSEGV` that are caused by an invalid operation in C code. Python will return from the signal handler to the C code, which is likely to raise the same signal again, causing Python to apparently hang. From Python 3.3 onwards, you can use the `faulthandler` module to report on synchronous errors.
  * A long-running calculation implemented purely in C (such as regular expression matching on a large body of text) may run uninterrupted for an arbitrary amount of time, regardless of any signals received. The Python signal handlers will be called when the calculation finishes.

### Signals and threads

Python signal handlers are always executed in the main Python thread of the
main interpreter, even if the signal was received in another thread. This
means that signals can’t be used as a means of inter-thread communication. You
can use the synchronization primitives from the `threading` module instead.

Besides, only the main thread of the main interpreter is allowed to set a new
signal handler.

## Module contents

Changed in version 3.5: signal (SIG*), handler (`SIG_DFL`, `SIG_IGN`) and
sigmask (`SIG_BLOCK`, `SIG_UNBLOCK`, `SIG_SETMASK`) related constants listed
below were turned into `enums`. `getsignal()`, `pthread_sigmask()`,
`sigpending()` and `sigwait()` functions return human-readable `enums`.

The variables defined in the `signal` module are:

`signal.SIG_DFL`

    
This is one of two standard signal handling options; it will simply perform
the default function for the signal. For example, on most systems the default
action for `SIGQUIT` is to dump core and exit, while the default action for
`SIGCHLD` is to simply ignore it.

`signal.SIG_IGN`

    
This is another standard signal handler, which will simply ignore the given
signal.

`signal.SIGABRT`

    
Abort signal from abort(3).

`signal.SIGALRM`

    
Timer signal from alarm(2).

Availability: Unix.

`signal.SIGBREAK`

    
Interrupt from keyboard (CTRL + BREAK).

Availability: Windows.

`signal.SIGBUS`

    
Bus error (bad memory access).

Availability: Unix.

`signal.SIGCHLD`

    
Child process stopped or terminated.

Availability: Unix.

`signal.SIGCLD`

    
Alias to `SIGCHLD`.

`signal.SIGCONT`

    
Continue the process if it is currently stopped

Availability: Unix.

`signal.SIGFPE`

    
Floating-point exception. For example, division by zero.

See also

`ZeroDivisionError` is raised when the second argument of a division or modulo
operation is zero.

`signal.SIGHUP`

    
Hangup detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process.

Availability: Unix.

`signal.SIGILL`

    
Illegal instruction.

`signal.SIGINT`

    
Interrupt from keyboard (CTRL + C).

Default action is to raise `KeyboardInterrupt`.

`signal.SIGKILL`

    
Kill signal.

It cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.

Availability: Unix.

`signal.SIGPIPE`

    
Broken pipe: write to pipe with no readers.

Default action is to ignore the signal.

Availability: Unix.

`signal.SIGSEGV`

    
Segmentation fault: invalid memory reference.

`signal.SIGTERM`

    
Termination signal.

`signal.SIGUSR1`

    
User-defined signal 1.

Availability: Unix.

`signal.SIGUSR2`

    
User-defined signal 2.

Availability: Unix.

`signal.SIGWINCH`

    
Window resize signal.

Availability: Unix.

`SIG*`

    
All the signal numbers are defined symbolically. For example, the hangup
signal is defined as `signal.SIGHUP`; the variable names are identical to the
names used in C programs, as found in `<signal.h>`. The Unix man page for
‘`signal()`’ lists the existing signals (on some systems this is signal(2), on
others the list is in signal(7)). Note that not all systems define the same
set of signal names; only those names defined by the system are defined by
this module.

`signal.CTRL_C_EVENT`

    
The signal corresponding to the `Ctrl+C` keystroke event. This signal can only
be used with `os.kill()`.

Availability: Windows.

New in version 3.2.

`signal.CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`

    
The signal corresponding to the `Ctrl+Break` keystroke event. This signal can
only be used with `os.kill()`.

Availability: Windows.

New in version 3.2.

`signal.NSIG`

    
One more than the number of the highest signal number.

`signal.ITIMER_REAL`

    
Decrements interval timer in real time, and delivers `SIGALRM` upon
expiration.

`signal.ITIMER_VIRTUAL`

    
Decrements interval timer only when the process is executing, and delivers
SIGVTALRM upon expiration.

`signal.ITIMER_PROF`

    
Decrements interval timer both when the process executes and when the system
is executing on behalf of the process. Coupled with ITIMER_VIRTUAL, this timer
is usually used to profile the time spent by the application in user and
kernel space. SIGPROF is delivered upon expiration.

`signal.SIG_BLOCK`

    
A possible value for the how parameter to `pthread_sigmask()` indicating that
signals are to be blocked.

New in version 3.3.

`signal.SIG_UNBLOCK`

    
A possible value for the how parameter to `pthread_sigmask()` indicating that
signals are to be unblocked.

New in version 3.3.

`signal.SIG_SETMASK`

    
A possible value for the how parameter to `pthread_sigmask()` indicating that
the signal mask is to be replaced.

New in version 3.3.

The `signal` module defines one exception:

`exception signal.ItimerError`

    
Raised to signal an error from the underlying `setitimer()` or `getitimer()`
implementation. Expect this error if an invalid interval timer or a negative
time is passed to `setitimer()`. This error is a subtype of `OSError`.

New in version 3.3: This error used to be a subtype of `IOError`, which is now
an alias of `OSError`.

The `signal` module defines the following functions:

`signal.alarm(time)`

    
If time is non-zero, this function requests that a `SIGALRM` signal be sent to
the process in time seconds. Any previously scheduled alarm is canceled (only
one alarm can be scheduled at any time). The returned value is then the number
of seconds before any previously set alarm was to have been delivered. If time
is zero, no alarm is scheduled, and any scheduled alarm is canceled. If the
return value is zero, no alarm is currently scheduled.

Availability: Unix. See the man page alarm(2) for further information.

`signal.getsignal(signalnum)`

    
Return the current signal handler for the signal signalnum. The returned value
may be a callable Python object, or one of the special values
`signal.SIG_IGN`, `signal.SIG_DFL` or `None`. Here, `signal.SIG_IGN` means
that the signal was previously ignored, `signal.SIG_DFL` means that the
default way of handling the signal was previously in use, and `None` means
that the previous signal handler was not installed from Python.

`signal.strsignal(signalnum)`

    
Return the system description of the signal signalnum, such as “Interrupt”,
“Segmentation fault”, etc. Returns `None` if the signal is not recognized.

New in version 3.8.

`signal.valid_signals()`

    
Return the set of valid signal numbers on this platform. This can be less than
`range(1, NSIG)` if some signals are reserved by the system for internal use.

New in version 3.8.

`signal.pause()`

    
Cause the process to sleep until a signal is received; the appropriate handler
will then be called. Returns nothing.

Availability: Unix. See the man page signal(2) for further information.

See also `sigwait()`, `sigwaitinfo()`, `sigtimedwait()` and `sigpending()`.

`signal.raise_signal(signum)`

    
Sends a signal to the calling process. Returns nothing.

New in version 3.8.

`signal.pidfd_send_signal(pidfd, sig, siginfo=None, flags=0)`

    
Send signal sig to the process referred to by file descriptor pidfd. Python
does not currently support the siginfo parameter; it must be `None`. The flags
argument is provided for future extensions; no flag values are currently
defined.

See the pidfd_send_signal(2) man page for more information.

Availability: Linux 5.1+

New in version 3.9.

`signal.pthread_kill(thread_id, signalnum)`

    
Send the signal signalnum to the thread thread_id, another thread in the same
process as the caller. The target thread can be executing any code (Python or
not). However, if the target thread is executing the Python interpreter, the
Python signal handlers will be executed by the main thread of the main
interpreter. Therefore, the only point of sending a signal to a particular
Python thread would be to force a running system call to fail with
`InterruptedError`.

Use `threading.get_ident()` or the `ident` attribute of `threading.Thread`
objects to get a suitable value for thread_id.

If signalnum is 0, then no signal is sent, but error checking is still
performed; this can be used to check if the target thread is still running.

Raises an auditing event `signal.pthread_kill` with arguments `thread_id`,
`signalnum`.

Availability: Unix. See the man page pthread_kill(3) for further information.

See also `os.kill()`.

New in version 3.3.

`signal.pthread_sigmask(how, mask)`

    
Fetch and/or change the signal mask of the calling thread. The signal mask is
the set of signals whose delivery is currently blocked for the caller. Return
the old signal mask as a set of signals.

The behavior of the call is dependent on the value of how, as follows.

  * `SIG_BLOCK`: The set of blocked signals is the union of the current set and the mask argument.
  * `SIG_UNBLOCK`: The signals in mask are removed from the current set of blocked signals. It is permissible to attempt to unblock a signal which is not blocked.
  * `SIG_SETMASK`: The set of blocked signals is set to the mask argument.

mask is a set of signal numbers (e.g. {`signal.SIGINT`, `signal.SIGTERM`}).
Use `valid_signals()` for a full mask including all signals.

For example, `signal.pthread_sigmask(signal.SIG_BLOCK, [])` reads the signal
mask of the calling thread.

`SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` cannot be blocked.

Availability: Unix. See the man page sigprocmask(3) and pthread_sigmask(3) for
further information.

See also `pause()`, `sigpending()` and `sigwait()`.

New in version 3.3.

`signal.setitimer(which, seconds, interval=0.0)`

    
Sets given interval timer (one of `signal.ITIMER_REAL`,
`signal.ITIMER_VIRTUAL` or `signal.ITIMER_PROF`) specified by which to fire
after seconds (float is accepted, different from `alarm()`) and after that
every interval seconds (if interval is non-zero). The interval timer specified
by which can be cleared by setting seconds to zero.

When an interval timer fires, a signal is sent to the process. The signal sent
is dependent on the timer being used; `signal.ITIMER_REAL` will deliver
`SIGALRM`, `signal.ITIMER_VIRTUAL` sends `SIGVTALRM`, and `signal.ITIMER_PROF`
will deliver `SIGPROF`.

The old values are returned as a tuple: (delay, interval).

Attempting to pass an invalid interval timer will cause an `ItimerError`.

Availability: Unix.

`signal.getitimer(which)`

    
Returns current value of a given interval timer specified by which.

Availability: Unix.

`signal.set_wakeup_fd(fd, *, warn_on_full_buffer=True)`

    
Set the wakeup file descriptor to fd. When a signal is received, the signal
number is written as a single byte into the fd. This can be used by a library
to wakeup a poll or select call, allowing the signal to be fully processed.

The old wakeup fd is returned (or -1 if file descriptor wakeup was not
enabled). If fd is -1, file descriptor wakeup is disabled. If not -1, fd must
be non-blocking. It is up to the library to remove any bytes from fd before
calling poll or select again.

When threads are enabled, this function can only be called from the main
thread of the main interpreter; attempting to call it from other threads will
cause a `ValueError` exception to be raised.

There are two common ways to use this function. In both approaches, you use
the fd to wake up when a signal arrives, but then they differ in how they
determine which signal or signals have arrived.

In the first approach, we read the data out of the fd’s buffer, and the byte
values give you the signal numbers. This is simple, but in rare cases it can
run into a problem: generally the fd will have a limited amount of buffer
space, and if too many signals arrive too quickly, then the buffer may become
full, and some signals may be lost. If you use this approach, then you should
set `warn_on_full_buffer=True`, which will at least cause a warning to be
printed to stderr when signals are lost.

In the second approach, we use the wakeup fd only for wakeups, and ignore the
actual byte values. In this case, all we care about is whether the fd’s buffer
is empty or non-empty; a full buffer doesn’t indicate a problem at all. If you
use this approach, then you should set `warn_on_full_buffer=False`, so that
your users are not confused by spurious warning messages.

Changed in version 3.5: On Windows, the function now also supports socket
handles.

Changed in version 3.7: Added `warn_on_full_buffer` parameter.

`signal.siginterrupt(signalnum, flag)`

    
Change system call restart behaviour: if flag is `False`, system calls will be
restarted when interrupted by signal signalnum, otherwise system calls will be
interrupted. Returns nothing.

Availability: Unix. See the man page siginterrupt(3) for further information.

Note that installing a signal handler with `signal()` will reset the restart
behaviour to interruptible by implicitly calling `siginterrupt()` with a true
flag value for the given signal.

`signal.signal(signalnum, handler)`

    
Set the handler for signal signalnum to the function handler. handler can be a
callable Python object taking two arguments (see below), or one of the special
values `signal.SIG_IGN` or `signal.SIG_DFL`. The previous signal handler will
be returned (see the description of `getsignal()` above). (See the Unix man
page signal(2) for further information.)

When threads are enabled, this function can only be called from the main
thread of the main interpreter; attempting to call it from other threads will
cause a `ValueError` exception to be raised.

The handler is called with two arguments: the signal number and the current
stack frame (`None` or a frame object; for a description of frame objects, see
the description in the type hierarchy or see the attribute descriptions in the
`inspect` module).

On Windows, `signal()` can only be called with `SIGABRT`, `SIGFPE`, `SIGILL`,
`SIGINT`, `SIGSEGV`, `SIGTERM`, or `SIGBREAK`. A `ValueError` will be raised
in any other case. Note that not all systems define the same set of signal
names; an `AttributeError` will be raised if a signal name is not defined as
`SIG*` module level constant.

`signal.sigpending()`

    
Examine the set of signals that are pending for delivery to the calling thread
(i.e., the signals which have been raised while blocked). Return the set of
the pending signals.

Availability: Unix. See the man page sigpending(2) for further information.

See also `pause()`, `pthread_sigmask()` and `sigwait()`.

New in version 3.3.

`signal.sigwait(sigset)`

    
Suspend execution of the calling thread until the delivery of one of the
signals specified in the signal set sigset. The function accepts the signal
(removes it from the pending list of signals), and returns the signal number.

Availability: Unix. See the man page sigwait(3) for further information.

See also `pause()`, `pthread_sigmask()`, `sigpending()`, `sigwaitinfo()` and
`sigtimedwait()`.

New in version 3.3.

`signal.sigwaitinfo(sigset)`

    
Suspend execution of the calling thread until the delivery of one of the
signals specified in the signal set sigset. The function accepts the signal
and removes it from the pending list of signals. If one of the signals in
sigset is already pending for the calling thread, the function will return
immediately with information about that signal. The signal handler is not
called for the delivered signal. The function raises an `InterruptedError` if
it is interrupted by a signal that is not in sigset.

The return value is an object representing the data contained in the
`siginfo_t` structure, namely: `si_signo`, `si_code`, `si_errno`, `si_pid`,
`si_uid`, `si_status`, `si_band`.

Availability: Unix. See the man page sigwaitinfo(2) for further information.

See also `pause()`, `sigwait()` and `sigtimedwait()`.

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried if interrupted by a signal
not in sigset and the signal handler does not raise an exception (see PEP 475
for the rationale).

`signal.sigtimedwait(sigset, timeout)`

    
Like `sigwaitinfo()`, but takes an additional timeout argument specifying a
timeout. If timeout is specified as `0`, a poll is performed. Returns `None`
if a timeout occurs.

Availability: Unix. See the man page sigtimedwait(2) for further information.

See also `pause()`, `sigwait()` and `sigwaitinfo()`.

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with the recomputed
timeout if interrupted by a signal not in sigset and the signal handler does
not raise an exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).

## Example

Here is a minimal example program. It uses the `alarm()` function to limit the
time spent waiting to open a file; this is useful if the file is for a serial
device that may not be turned on, which would normally cause the `os.open()`
to hang indefinitely. The solution is to set a 5-second alarm before opening
the file; if the operation takes too long, the alarm signal will be sent, and
the handler raises an exception.

    
    import signal, os
    
    def handler(signum, frame):
        print('Signal handler called with signal', signum)
        raise OSError("Couldn't open device!")
    
    # Set the signal handler and a 5-second alarm
    signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, handler)
    signal.alarm(5)
    
    # This open() may hang indefinitely
    fd = os.open('/dev/ttyS0', os.O_RDWR)
    
    signal.alarm(0)          # Disable the alarm
    
## Note on SIGPIPE

Piping output of your program to tools like head(1) will cause a `SIGPIPE`
signal to be sent to your process when the receiver of its standard output
closes early. This results in an exception like `BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32]
Broken pipe`. To handle this case, wrap your entry point to catch this
exception as follows:

    
    import os
    import sys
    
    def main():
        try:
            # simulate large output (your code replaces this loop)
            for x in range(10000):
                print("y")
            # flush output here to force SIGPIPE to be triggered
            # while inside this try block.
            sys.stdout.flush()
        except BrokenPipeError:
            # Python flushes standard streams on exit; redirect remaining output
            # to devnull to avoid another BrokenPipeError at shutdown
            devnull = os.open(os.devnull, os.O_WRONLY)
            os.dup2(devnull, sys.stdout.fileno())
            sys.exit(1)  # Python exits with error code 1 on EPIPE
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
    
Do not set `SIGPIPE`’s disposition to `SIG_DFL` in order to avoid
`BrokenPipeError`. Doing that would cause your program to exit unexpectedly
also whenever any socket connection is interrupted while your program is still
writing to it.
