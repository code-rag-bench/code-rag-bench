# queue — A synchronized queue class

Source code: Lib/queue.py

The `queue` module implements multi-producer, multi-consumer queues. It is
especially useful in threaded programming when information must be exchanged
safely between multiple threads. The `Queue` class in this module implements
all the required locking semantics.

The module implements three types of queue, which differ only in the order in
which the entries are retrieved. In a FIFO queue, the first tasks added are
the first retrieved. In a LIFO queue, the most recently added entry is the
first retrieved (operating like a stack). With a priority queue, the entries
are kept sorted (using the `heapq` module) and the lowest valued entry is
retrieved first.

Internally, those three types of queues use locks to temporarily block
competing threads; however, they are not designed to handle reentrancy within
a thread.

In addition, the module implements a “simple” FIFO queue type, `SimpleQueue`,
whose specific implementation provides additional guarantees in exchange for
the smaller functionality.

The `queue` module defines the following classes and exceptions:

`class queue.Queue(maxsize=0)`

    
Constructor for a FIFO queue. maxsize is an integer that sets the upperbound
limit on the number of items that can be placed in the queue. Insertion will
block once this size has been reached, until queue items are consumed. If
maxsize is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.

`class queue.LifoQueue(maxsize=0)`

    
Constructor for a LIFO queue. maxsize is an integer that sets the upperbound
limit on the number of items that can be placed in the queue. Insertion will
block once this size has been reached, until queue items are consumed. If
maxsize is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.

`class queue.PriorityQueue(maxsize=0)`

    
Constructor for a priority queue. maxsize is an integer that sets the
upperbound limit on the number of items that can be placed in the queue.
Insertion will block once this size has been reached, until queue items are
consumed. If maxsize is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is
infinite.

The lowest valued entries are retrieved first (the lowest valued entry is the
one returned by `sorted(list(entries))[0]`). A typical pattern for entries is
a tuple in the form: `(priority_number, data)`.

If the data elements are not comparable, the data can be wrapped in a class
that ignores the data item and only compares the priority number:

    
    from dataclasses import dataclass, field
    from typing import Any
    
    @dataclass(order=True)
    class PrioritizedItem:
        priority: int
        item: Any=field(compare=False)
    
`class queue.SimpleQueue`

    
Constructor for an unbounded FIFO queue. Simple queues lack advanced
functionality such as task tracking.

New in version 3.7.

`exception queue.Empty`

    
Exception raised when non-blocking `get()` (or `get_nowait()`) is called on a
`Queue` object which is empty.

`exception queue.Full`

    
Exception raised when non-blocking `put()` (or `put_nowait()`) is called on a
`Queue` object which is full.

## Queue Objects

Queue objects (`Queue`, `LifoQueue`, or `PriorityQueue`) provide the public
methods described below.

`Queue.qsize()`

    
Return the approximate size of the queue. Note, qsize() > 0 doesn’t guarantee
that a subsequent get() will not block, nor will qsize() < maxsize guarantee
that put() will not block.

`Queue.empty()`

    
Return `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise. If empty() returns
`True` it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent call to put() will not block.
Similarly, if empty() returns `False` it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent
call to get() will not block.

`Queue.full()`

    
Return `True` if the queue is full, `False` otherwise. If full() returns
`True` it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent call to get() will not block.
Similarly, if full() returns `False` it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent
call to put() will not block.

`Queue.put(item, block=True, timeout=None)`

    
Put item into the queue. If optional args block is true and timeout is `None`
(the default), block if necessary until a free slot is available. If timeout
is a positive number, it blocks at most timeout seconds and raises the `Full`
exception if no free slot was available within that time. Otherwise (block is
false), put an item on the queue if a free slot is immediately available, else
raise the `Full` exception (timeout is ignored in that case).

`Queue.put_nowait(item)`

    
Equivalent to `put(item, False)`.

`Queue.get(block=True, timeout=None)`

    
Remove and return an item from the queue. If optional args block is true and
timeout is `None` (the default), block if necessary until an item is
available. If timeout is a positive number, it blocks at most timeout seconds
and raises the `Empty` exception if no item was available within that time.
Otherwise (block is false), return an item if one is immediately available,
else raise the `Empty` exception (timeout is ignored in that case).

Prior to 3.0 on POSIX systems, and for all versions on Windows, if block is
true and timeout is `None`, this operation goes into an uninterruptible wait
on an underlying lock. This means that no exceptions can occur, and in
particular a SIGINT will not trigger a `KeyboardInterrupt`.

`Queue.get_nowait()`

    
Equivalent to `get(False)`.

Two methods are offered to support tracking whether enqueued tasks have been
fully processed by daemon consumer threads.

`Queue.task_done()`

    
Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete. Used by queue consumer
threads. For each `get()` used to fetch a task, a subsequent call to
`task_done()` tells the queue that the processing on the task is complete.

If a `join()` is currently blocking, it will resume when all items have been
processed (meaning that a `task_done()` call was received for every item that
had been `put()` into the queue).

Raises a `ValueError` if called more times than there were items placed in the
queue.

`Queue.join()`

    
Blocks until all items in the queue have been gotten and processed.

The count of unfinished tasks goes up whenever an item is added to the queue.
The count goes down whenever a consumer thread calls `task_done()` to indicate
that the item was retrieved and all work on it is complete. When the count of
unfinished tasks drops to zero, `join()` unblocks.

Example of how to wait for enqueued tasks to be completed:

    
    import threading, queue
    
    q = queue.Queue()
    
    def worker():
        while True:
            item = q.get()
            print(f'Working on {item}')
            print(f'Finished {item}')
            q.task_done()
    
    # turn-on the worker thread
    threading.Thread(target=worker, daemon=True).start()
    
    # send thirty task requests to the worker
    for item in range(30):
        q.put(item)
    print('All task requests sent\n', end='')
    
    # block until all tasks are done
    q.join()
    print('All work completed')
    
## SimpleQueue Objects

`SimpleQueue` objects provide the public methods described below.

`SimpleQueue.qsize()`

    
Return the approximate size of the queue. Note, qsize() > 0 doesn’t guarantee
that a subsequent get() will not block.

`SimpleQueue.empty()`

    
Return `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise. If empty() returns
`False` it doesn’t guarantee that a subsequent call to get() will not block.

`SimpleQueue.put(item, block=True, timeout=None)`

    
Put item into the queue. The method never blocks and always succeeds (except
for potential low-level errors such as failure to allocate memory). The
optional args block and timeout are ignored and only provided for
compatibility with `Queue.put()`.

CPython implementation detail: This method has a C implementation which is
reentrant. That is, a `put()` or `get()` call can be interrupted by another
`put()` call in the same thread without deadlocking or corrupting internal
state inside the queue. This makes it appropriate for use in destructors such
as `__del__` methods or `weakref` callbacks.

`SimpleQueue.put_nowait(item)`

    
Equivalent to `put(item)`, provided for compatibility with
`Queue.put_nowait()`.

`SimpleQueue.get(block=True, timeout=None)`

    
Remove and return an item from the queue. If optional args block is true and
timeout is `None` (the default), block if necessary until an item is
available. If timeout is a positive number, it blocks at most timeout seconds
and raises the `Empty` exception if no item was available within that time.
Otherwise (block is false), return an item if one is immediately available,
else raise the `Empty` exception (timeout is ignored in that case).

`SimpleQueue.get_nowait()`

    
Equivalent to `get(False)`.

`Class` `multiprocessing.Queue`

    
A queue class for use in a multi-processing (rather than multi-threading)
context.

`collections.deque` is an alternative implementation of unbounded queues with
fast atomic `append()` and `popleft()` operations that do not require locking
and also support indexing.
