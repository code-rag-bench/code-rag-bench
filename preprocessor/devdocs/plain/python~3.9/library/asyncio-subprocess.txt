# Subprocesses

Source code: Lib/asyncio/subprocess.py, Lib/asyncio/base_subprocess.py

This section describes high-level async/await asyncio APIs to create and
manage subprocesses.

Here’s an example of how asyncio can run a shell command and obtain its
result:

    
    import asyncio
    
    async def run(cmd):
        proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(
            cmd,
            stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE,
            stderr=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE)
    
        stdout, stderr = await proc.communicate()
    
        print(f'[{cmd!r} exited with {proc.returncode}]')
        if stdout:
            print(f'[stdout]\n{stdout.decode()}')
        if stderr:
            print(f'[stderr]\n{stderr.decode()}')
    
    asyncio.run(run('ls /zzz'))
    
will print:

    
    ['ls /zzz' exited with 1]
    [stderr]
    ls: /zzz: No such file or directory
    
Because all asyncio subprocess functions are asynchronous and asyncio provides
many tools to work with such functions, it is easy to execute and monitor
multiple subprocesses in parallel. It is indeed trivial to modify the above
example to run several commands simultaneously:

    
    async def main():
        await asyncio.gather(
            run('ls /zzz'),
            run('sleep 1; echo "hello"'))
    
    asyncio.run(main())

## Creating Subprocesses

`coroutine asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(program, *args, stdin=None,
stdout=None, stderr=None, loop=None, limit=None, **kwds)`

    
Create a subprocess.

The limit argument sets the buffer limit for `StreamReader` wrappers for
`Process.stdout` and `Process.stderr` (if `subprocess.PIPE` is passed to
stdout and stderr arguments).

Return a `Process` instance.

See the documentation of `loop.subprocess_exec()` for other parameters.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop
parameter.

`coroutine asyncio.create_subprocess_shell(cmd, stdin=None, stdout=None,
stderr=None, loop=None, limit=None, **kwds)`

    
Run the cmd shell command.

The limit argument sets the buffer limit for `StreamReader` wrappers for
`Process.stdout` and `Process.stderr` (if `subprocess.PIPE` is passed to
stdout and stderr arguments).

Return a `Process` instance.

See the documentation of `loop.subprocess_shell()` for other parameters.

Important

It is the application’s responsibility to ensure that all whitespace and
special characters are quoted appropriately to avoid shell injection
vulnerabilities. The `shlex.quote()` function can be used to properly escape
whitespace and special shell characters in strings that are going to be used
to construct shell commands.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop
parameter.

Note

Subprocesses are available for Windows if a `ProactorEventLoop` is used. See
Subprocess Support on Windows for details.

asyncio also has the following low-level APIs to work with subprocesses:
`loop.subprocess_exec()`, `loop.subprocess_shell()`,
`loop.connect_read_pipe()`, `loop.connect_write_pipe()`, as well as the
Subprocess Transports and Subprocess Protocols.

## Constants

`asyncio.subprocess.PIPE`

    
Can be passed to the stdin, stdout or stderr parameters.

If PIPE is passed to stdin argument, the `Process.stdin` attribute will point
to a `StreamWriter` instance.

If PIPE is passed to stdout or stderr arguments, the `Process.stdout` and
`Process.stderr` attributes will point to `StreamReader` instances.

`asyncio.subprocess.STDOUT`

    
Special value that can be used as the stderr argument and indicates that
standard error should be redirected into standard output.

`asyncio.subprocess.DEVNULL`

    
Special value that can be used as the stdin, stdout or stderr argument to
process creation functions. It indicates that the special file `os.devnull`
will be used for the corresponding subprocess stream.

## Interacting with Subprocesses

Both `create_subprocess_exec()` and `create_subprocess_shell()` functions
return instances of the Process class. Process is a high-level wrapper that
allows communicating with subprocesses and watching for their completion.

`class asyncio.subprocess.Process`

    
An object that wraps OS processes created by the `create_subprocess_exec()`
and `create_subprocess_shell()` functions.

This class is designed to have a similar API to the `subprocess.Popen` class,
but there are some notable differences:

  * unlike Popen, Process instances do not have an equivalent to the `poll()` method;
  * the `communicate()` and `wait()` methods don’t have a timeout parameter: use the `wait_for()` function;
  * the `Process.wait()` method is asynchronous, whereas `subprocess.Popen.wait()` method is implemented as a blocking busy loop;
  * the universal_newlines parameter is not supported.

This class is not thread safe.

See also the Subprocess and Threads section.

`coroutine wait()`

    
Wait for the child process to terminate.

Set and return the `returncode` attribute.

Note

This method can deadlock when using `stdout=PIPE` or `stderr=PIPE` and the
child process generates so much output that it blocks waiting for the OS pipe
buffer to accept more data. Use the `communicate()` method when using pipes to
avoid this condition.

`coroutine communicate(input=None)`

    
Interact with process:

  1. send data to stdin (if input is not `None`);
  2. read data from stdout and stderr, until EOF is reached;
  3. wait for process to terminate.

The optional input argument is the data (`bytes` object) that will be sent to
the child process.

Return a tuple `(stdout_data, stderr_data)`.

If either `BrokenPipeError` or `ConnectionResetError` exception is raised when
writing input into stdin, the exception is ignored. This condition occurs when
the process exits before all data are written into stdin.

If it is desired to send data to the process’ stdin, the process needs to be
created with `stdin=PIPE`. Similarly, to get anything other than `None` in the
result tuple, the process has to be created with `stdout=PIPE` and/or
`stderr=PIPE` arguments.

Note, that the data read is buffered in memory, so do not use this method if
the data size is large or unlimited.

`send_signal(signal)`

    
Sends the signal signal to the child process.

Note

On Windows, `SIGTERM` is an alias for `terminate()`. `CTRL_C_EVENT` and
`CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` can be sent to processes started with a creationflags
parameter which includes `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`.

`terminate()`

    
Stop the child process.

On POSIX systems this method sends `signal.SIGTERM` to the child process.

On Windows the Win32 API function `TerminateProcess()` is called to stop the
child process.

`kill()`

    
Kill the child process.

On POSIX systems this method sends `SIGKILL` to the child process.

On Windows this method is an alias for `terminate()`.

`stdin`

    
Standard input stream (`StreamWriter`) or `None` if the process was created
with `stdin=None`.

`stdout`

    
Standard output stream (`StreamReader`) or `None` if the process was created
with `stdout=None`.

`stderr`

    
Standard error stream (`StreamReader`) or `None` if the process was created
with `stderr=None`.

Warning

Use the `communicate()` method rather than `process.stdin.write()`, `await
process.stdout.read()` or `await process.stderr.read`. This avoids deadlocks
due to streams pausing reading or writing and blocking the child process.

`pid`

    
Process identification number (PID).

Note that for processes created by the `create_subprocess_shell()` function,
this attribute is the PID of the spawned shell.

`returncode`

    
Return code of the process when it exits.

A `None` value indicates that the process has not terminated yet.

A negative value `-N` indicates that the child was terminated by signal `N`
(POSIX only).

### Subprocess and Threads

Standard asyncio event loop supports running subprocesses from different
threads by default.

On Windows subprocesses are provided by `ProactorEventLoop` only (default),
`SelectorEventLoop` has no subprocess support.

On UNIX child watchers are used for subprocess finish waiting, see Process
Watchers for more info.

Changed in version 3.8: UNIX switched to use `ThreadedChildWatcher` for
spawning subprocesses from different threads without any limitation.

Spawning a subprocess with inactive current child watcher raises
`RuntimeError`.

Note that alternative event loop implementations might have own limitations;
please refer to their documentation.

### Examples

An example using the `Process` class to control a subprocess and the
`StreamReader` class to read from its standard output.

The subprocess is created by the `create_subprocess_exec()` function:

    
    import asyncio
    import sys
    
    async def get_date():
        code = 'import datetime; print(datetime.datetime.now())'
    
        # Create the subprocess; redirect the standard output
        # into a pipe.
        proc = await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
            sys.executable, '-c', code,
            stdout=asyncio.subprocess.PIPE)
    
        # Read one line of output.
        data = await proc.stdout.readline()
        line = data.decode('ascii').rstrip()
    
        # Wait for the subprocess exit.
        await proc.wait()
        return line
    
    date = asyncio.run(get_date())
    print(f"Current date: {date}")
