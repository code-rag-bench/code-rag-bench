# uu — Encode and decode uuencode files

Source code: Lib/uu.py

This module encodes and decodes files in uuencode format, allowing arbitrary
binary data to be transferred over ASCII-only connections. Wherever a file
argument is expected, the methods accept a file-like object. For backwards
compatibility, a string containing a pathname is also accepted, and the
corresponding file will be opened for reading and writing; the pathname `'-'`
is understood to mean the standard input or output. However, this interface is
deprecated; it’s better for the caller to open the file itself, and be sure
that, when required, the mode is `'rb'` or `'wb'` on Windows.

This code was contributed by Lance Ellinghouse, and modified by Jack Jansen.

The `uu` module defines the following functions:

`uu.encode(in_file, out_file, name=None, mode=None, *, backtick=False)`

    
Uuencode file in_file into file out_file. The uuencoded file will have the
header specifying name and mode as the defaults for the results of decoding
the file. The default defaults are taken from in_file, or `'-'` and `0o666`
respectively. If backtick is true, zeros are represented by `'`'` instead of
spaces.

Changed in version 3.7: Added the backtick parameter.

`uu.decode(in_file, out_file=None, mode=None, quiet=False)`

    
This call decodes uuencoded file in_file placing the result on file out_file.
If out_file is a pathname, mode is used to set the permission bits if the file
must be created. Defaults for out_file and mode are taken from the uuencode
header. However, if the file specified in the header already exists, a
`uu.Error` is raised.

`decode()` may print a warning to standard error if the input was produced by
an incorrect uuencoder and Python could recover from that error. Setting quiet
to a true value silences this warning.

`exception uu.Error`

    
Subclass of `Exception`, this can be raised by `uu.decode()` under various
situations, such as described above, but also including a badly formatted
header, or truncated input file.
