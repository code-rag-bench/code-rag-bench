# warnings — Warning control

Source code: Lib/warnings.py

Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to
alert the user of some condition in a program, where that condition (normally)
doesn’t warrant raising an exception and terminating the program. For example,
one might want to issue a warning when a program uses an obsolete module.

Python programmers issue warnings by calling the `warn()` function defined in
this module. (C programmers use `PyErr_WarnEx()`; see Exception Handling for
details).

Warning messages are normally written to `sys.stderr`, but their disposition
can be changed flexibly, from ignoring all warnings to turning them into
exceptions. The disposition of warnings can vary based on the warning
category, the text of the warning message, and the source location where it is
issued. Repetitions of a particular warning for the same source location are
typically suppressed.

There are two stages in warning control: first, each time a warning is issued,
a determination is made whether a message should be issued or not; next, if a
message is to be issued, it is formatted and printed using a user-settable
hook.

The determination whether to issue a warning message is controlled by the
warning filter, which is a sequence of matching rules and actions. Rules can
be added to the filter by calling `filterwarnings()` and reset to its default
state by calling `resetwarnings()`.

The printing of warning messages is done by calling `showwarning()`, which may
be overridden; the default implementation of this function formats the message
by calling `formatwarning()`, which is also available for use by custom
implementations.

`logging.captureWarnings()` allows you to handle all warnings with the
standard logging infrastructure.

## Warning Categories

There are a number of built-in exceptions that represent warning categories.
This categorization is useful to be able to filter out groups of warnings.

While these are technically built-in exceptions, they are documented here,
because conceptually they belong to the warnings mechanism.

User code can define additional warning categories by subclassing one of the
standard warning categories. A warning category must always be a subclass of
the `Warning` class.

The following warnings category classes are currently defined:

Class | Description  
---|---  
`Warning` | This is the base class of all warning category classes. It is a subclass of `Exception`.  
`UserWarning` | The default category for `warn()`.  
`DeprecationWarning` | Base category for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are intended for other Python developers (ignored by default, unless triggered by code in `__main__`).  
`SyntaxWarning` | Base category for warnings about dubious syntactic features.  
`RuntimeWarning` | Base category for warnings about dubious runtime features.  
`FutureWarning` | Base category for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are intended for end users of applications that are written in Python.  
`PendingDeprecationWarning` | Base category for warnings about features that will be deprecated in the future (ignored by default).  
`ImportWarning` | Base category for warnings triggered during the process of importing a module (ignored by default).  
`UnicodeWarning` | Base category for warnings related to Unicode.  
`BytesWarning` | Base category for warnings related to `bytes` and `bytearray`.  
`ResourceWarning` | Base category for warnings related to resource usage.  
Changed in version 3.7: Previously `DeprecationWarning` and `FutureWarning`
were distinguished based on whether a feature was being removed entirely or
changing its behaviour. They are now distinguished based on their intended
audience and the way they’re handled by the default warnings filters.

## The Warnings Filter

The warnings filter controls whether warnings are ignored, displayed, or
turned into errors (raising an exception).

Conceptually, the warnings filter maintains an ordered list of filter
specifications; any specific warning is matched against each filter
specification in the list in turn until a match is found; the filter
determines the disposition of the match. Each entry is a tuple of the form
(action, message, category, module, lineno), where:

  * action is one of the following strings:
Value | Disposition  
---|---  
`"default"` | print the first occurrence of matching warnings for each location (module + line number) where the warning is issued  
`"error"` | turn matching warnings into exceptions  
`"ignore"` | never print matching warnings  
`"always"` | always print matching warnings  
`"module"` | print the first occurrence of matching warnings for each module where the warning is issued (regardless of line number)  
`"once"` | print only the first occurrence of matching warnings, regardless of location  
  * message is a string containing a regular expression that the start of the warning message must match. The expression is compiled to always be case-insensitive.
  * category is a class (a subclass of `Warning`) of which the warning category must be a subclass in order to match.
  * module is a string containing a regular expression that the module name must match. The expression is compiled to be case-sensitive.
  * lineno is an integer that the line number where the warning occurred must match, or `0` to match all line numbers.

Since the `Warning` class is derived from the built-in `Exception` class, to
turn a warning into an error we simply raise `category(message)`.

If a warning is reported and doesn’t match any registered filter then the
“default” action is applied (hence its name).

### Describing Warning Filters

The warnings filter is initialized by `-W` options passed to the Python
interpreter command line and the `PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable. The
interpreter saves the arguments for all supplied entries without
interpretation in `sys.warnoptions`; the `warnings` module parses these when
it is first imported (invalid options are ignored, after printing a message to
`sys.stderr`).

Individual warnings filters are specified as a sequence of fields separated by
colons:

    
    action:message:category:module:line
    
The meaning of each of these fields is as described in The Warnings Filter.
When listing multiple filters on a single line (as for `PYTHONWARNINGS`), the
individual filters are separated by commas and the filters listed later take
precedence over those listed before them (as they’re applied left-to-right,
and the most recently applied filters take precedence over earlier ones).

Commonly used warning filters apply to either all warnings, warnings in a
particular category, or warnings raised by particular modules or packages.
Some examples:

    
    default                      # Show all warnings (even those ignored by default)
    ignore                       # Ignore all warnings
    error                        # Convert all warnings to errors
    error::ResourceWarning       # Treat ResourceWarning messages as errors
    default::DeprecationWarning  # Show DeprecationWarning messages
    ignore,default:::mymodule    # Only report warnings triggered by "mymodule"
    error:::mymodule[.*]         # Convert warnings to errors in "mymodule"
                                 # and any subpackages of "mymodule"
    
### Default Warning Filter

By default, Python installs several warning filters, which can be overridden
by the `-W` command-line option, the `PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable and
calls to `filterwarnings()`.

In regular release builds, the default warning filter has the following
entries (in order of precedence):

    
    default::DeprecationWarning:__main__
    ignore::DeprecationWarning
    ignore::PendingDeprecationWarning
    ignore::ImportWarning
    ignore::ResourceWarning
    
In debug builds, the list of default warning filters is empty.

Changed in version 3.2: `DeprecationWarning` is now ignored by default in
addition to `PendingDeprecationWarning`.

Changed in version 3.7: `DeprecationWarning` is once again shown by default
when triggered directly by code in `__main__`.

Changed in version 3.7: `BytesWarning` no longer appears in the default filter
list and is instead configured via `sys.warnoptions` when `-b` is specified
twice.

### Overriding the default filter

Developers of applications written in Python may wish to hide all Python level
warnings from their users by default, and only display them when running tests
or otherwise working on the application. The `sys.warnoptions` attribute used
to pass filter configurations to the interpreter can be used as a marker to
indicate whether or not warnings should be disabled:

    
    import sys
    
    if not sys.warnoptions:
        import warnings
        warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
    
Developers of test runners for Python code are advised to instead ensure that
all warnings are displayed by default for the code under test, using code
like:

    
    import sys
    
    if not sys.warnoptions:
        import os, warnings
        warnings.simplefilter("default") # Change the filter in this process
        os.environ["PYTHONWARNINGS"] = "default" # Also affect subprocesses
    
Finally, developers of interactive shells that run user code in a namespace
other than `__main__` are advised to ensure that `DeprecationWarning` messages
are made visible by default, using code like the following (where `user_ns` is
the module used to execute code entered interactively):

    
    import warnings
    warnings.filterwarnings("default", category=DeprecationWarning,
                                       module=user_ns.get("__name__"))
    
## Temporarily Suppressing Warnings

If you are using code that you know will raise a warning, such as a deprecated
function, but do not want to see the warning (even when warnings have been
explicitly configured via the command line), then it is possible to suppress
the warning using the `catch_warnings` context manager:

    
    import warnings
    
    def fxn():
        warnings.warn("deprecated", DeprecationWarning)
    
    with warnings.catch_warnings():
        warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
        fxn()
    
While within the context manager all warnings will simply be ignored. This
allows you to use known-deprecated code without having to see the warning
while not suppressing the warning for other code that might not be aware of
its use of deprecated code. Note: this can only be guaranteed in a single-
threaded application. If two or more threads use the `catch_warnings` context
manager at the same time, the behavior is undefined.

## Testing Warnings

To test warnings raised by code, use the `catch_warnings` context manager.
With it you can temporarily mutate the warnings filter to facilitate your
testing. For instance, do the following to capture all raised warnings to
check:

    
    import warnings
    
    def fxn():
        warnings.warn("deprecated", DeprecationWarning)
    
    with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:
        # Cause all warnings to always be triggered.
        warnings.simplefilter("always")
        # Trigger a warning.
        fxn()
        # Verify some things
        assert len(w) == 1
        assert issubclass(w[-1].category, DeprecationWarning)
        assert "deprecated" in str(w[-1].message)
    
One can also cause all warnings to be exceptions by using `error` instead of
`always`. One thing to be aware of is that if a warning has already been
raised because of a `once`/`default` rule, then no matter what filters are set
the warning will not be seen again unless the warnings registry related to the
warning has been cleared.

Once the context manager exits, the warnings filter is restored to its state
when the context was entered. This prevents tests from changing the warnings
filter in unexpected ways between tests and leading to indeterminate test
results. The `showwarning()` function in the module is also restored to its
original value. Note: this can only be guaranteed in a single-threaded
application. If two or more threads use the `catch_warnings` context manager
at the same time, the behavior is undefined.

When testing multiple operations that raise the same kind of warning, it is
important to test them in a manner that confirms each operation is raising a
new warning (e.g. set warnings to be raised as exceptions and check the
operations raise exceptions, check that the length of the warning list
continues to increase after each operation, or else delete the previous
entries from the warnings list before each new operation).

## Updating Code For New Versions of Dependencies

Warning categories that are primarily of interest to Python developers (rather
than end users of applications written in Python) are ignored by default.

Notably, this “ignored by default” list includes `DeprecationWarning` (for
every module except `__main__`), which means developers should make sure to
test their code with typically ignored warnings made visible in order to
receive timely notifications of future breaking API changes (whether in the
standard library or third party packages).

In the ideal case, the code will have a suitable test suite, and the test
runner will take care of implicitly enabling all warnings when running tests
(the test runner provided by the `unittest` module does this).

In less ideal cases, applications can be checked for use of deprecated
interfaces by passing `-Wd` to the Python interpreter (this is shorthand for
`-W default`) or setting `PYTHONWARNINGS=default` in the environment. This
enables default handling for all warnings, including those that are ignored by
default. To change what action is taken for encountered warnings you can
change what argument is passed to `-W` (e.g. `-W error`). See the `-W` flag
for more details on what is possible.

## Available Functions

`warnings.warn(message, category=None, stacklevel=1, source=None)`

    
Issue a warning, or maybe ignore it or raise an exception. The category
argument, if given, must be a warning category class; it defaults to
`UserWarning`. Alternatively, message can be a `Warning` instance, in which
case category will be ignored and `message.__class__` will be used. In this
case, the message text will be `str(message)`. This function raises an
exception if the particular warning issued is changed into an error by the
warnings filter. The stacklevel argument can be used by wrapper functions
written in Python, like this:

    
    def deprecation(message):
        warnings.warn(message, DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
    
This makes the warning refer to `deprecation()`’s caller, rather than to the
source of `deprecation()` itself (since the latter would defeat the purpose of
the warning message).

source, if supplied, is the destroyed object which emitted a
`ResourceWarning`.

Changed in version 3.6: Added source parameter.

`warnings.warn_explicit(message, category, filename, lineno, module=None,
registry=None, module_globals=None, source=None)`

    
This is a low-level interface to the functionality of `warn()`, passing in
explicitly the message, category, filename and line number, and optionally the
module name and the registry (which should be the `__warningregistry__`
dictionary of the module). The module name defaults to the filename with `.py`
stripped; if no registry is passed, the warning is never suppressed. message
must be a string and category a subclass of `Warning` or message may be a
`Warning` instance, in which case category will be ignored.

module_globals, if supplied, should be the global namespace in use by the code
for which the warning is issued. (This argument is used to support displaying
source for modules found in zipfiles or other non-filesystem import sources).

source, if supplied, is the destroyed object which emitted a
`ResourceWarning`.

Changed in version 3.6: Add the source parameter.

`warnings.showwarning(message, category, filename, lineno, file=None,
line=None)`

    
Write a warning to a file. The default implementation calls
`formatwarning(message, category, filename, lineno, line)` and writes the
resulting string to file, which defaults to `sys.stderr`. You may replace this
function with any callable by assigning to `warnings.showwarning`. line is a
line of source code to be included in the warning message; if line is not
supplied, `showwarning()` will try to read the line specified by filename and
lineno.

`warnings.formatwarning(message, category, filename, lineno, line=None)`

    
Format a warning the standard way. This returns a string which may contain
embedded newlines and ends in a newline. line is a line of source code to be
included in the warning message; if line is not supplied, `formatwarning()`
will try to read the line specified by filename and lineno.

`warnings.filterwarnings(action, message='', category=Warning, module='',
lineno=0, append=False)`

    
Insert an entry into the list of warnings filter specifications. The entry is
inserted at the front by default; if append is true, it is inserted at the
end. This checks the types of the arguments, compiles the message and module
regular expressions, and inserts them as a tuple in the list of warnings
filters. Entries closer to the front of the list override entries later in the
list, if both match a particular warning. Omitted arguments default to a value
that matches everything.

`warnings.simplefilter(action, category=Warning, lineno=0, append=False)`

    
Insert a simple entry into the list of warnings filter specifications. The
meaning of the function parameters is as for `filterwarnings()`, but regular
expressions are not needed as the filter inserted always matches any message
in any module as long as the category and line number match.

`warnings.resetwarnings()`

    
Reset the warnings filter. This discards the effect of all previous calls to
`filterwarnings()`, including that of the `-W` command line options and calls
to `simplefilter()`.

## Available Context Managers

`class warnings.catch_warnings(*, record=False, module=None)`

    
A context manager that copies and, upon exit, restores the warnings filter and
the `showwarning()` function. If the record argument is `False` (the default)
the context manager returns `None` on entry. If record is `True`, a list is
returned that is progressively populated with objects as seen by a custom
`showwarning()` function (which also suppresses output to `sys.stdout`). Each
object in the list has attributes with the same names as the arguments to
`showwarning()`.

The module argument takes a module that will be used instead of the module
returned when you import `warnings` whose filter will be protected. This
argument exists primarily for testing the `warnings` module itself.

Note

The `catch_warnings` manager works by replacing and then later restoring the
module’s `showwarning()` function and internal list of filter specifications.
This means the context manager is modifying global state and therefore is not
thread-safe.
