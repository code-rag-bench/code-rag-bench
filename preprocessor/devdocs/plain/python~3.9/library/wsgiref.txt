# wsgiref — WSGI Utilities and Reference Implementation

The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a standard interface between web
server software and web applications written in Python. Having a standard
interface makes it easy to use an application that supports WSGI with a number
of different web servers.

Only authors of web servers and programming frameworks need to know every
detail and corner case of the WSGI design. You don’t need to understand every
detail of WSGI just to install a WSGI application or to write a web
application using an existing framework.

`wsgiref` is a reference implementation of the WSGI specification that can be
used to add WSGI support to a web server or framework. It provides utilities
for manipulating WSGI environment variables and response headers, base classes
for implementing WSGI servers, a demo HTTP server that serves WSGI
applications, and a validation tool that checks WSGI servers and applications
for conformance to the WSGI specification (PEP 3333).

See wsgi.readthedocs.io for more information about WSGI, and links to
tutorials and other resources.

## wsgiref.util – WSGI environment utilities

This module provides a variety of utility functions for working with WSGI
environments. A WSGI environment is a dictionary containing HTTP request
variables as described in PEP 3333. All of the functions taking an environ
parameter expect a WSGI-compliant dictionary to be supplied; please see PEP
3333 for a detailed specification.

`wsgiref.util.guess_scheme(environ)`

    
Return a guess for whether `wsgi.url_scheme` should be “http” or “https”, by
checking for a `HTTPS` environment variable in the environ dictionary. The
return value is a string.

This function is useful when creating a gateway that wraps CGI or a CGI-like
protocol such as FastCGI. Typically, servers providing such protocols will
include a `HTTPS` variable with a value of “1”, “yes”, or “on” when a request
is received via SSL. So, this function returns “https” if such a value is
found, and “http” otherwise.

`wsgiref.util.request_uri(environ, include_query=True)`

    
Return the full request URI, optionally including the query string, using the
algorithm found in the “URL Reconstruction” section of PEP 3333. If
include_query is false, the query string is not included in the resulting URI.

`wsgiref.util.application_uri(environ)`

    
Similar to `request_uri()`, except that the `PATH_INFO` and `QUERY_STRING`
variables are ignored. The result is the base URI of the application object
addressed by the request.

`wsgiref.util.shift_path_info(environ)`

    
Shift a single name from `PATH_INFO` to `SCRIPT_NAME` and return the name. The
environ dictionary is modified in-place; use a copy if you need to keep the
original `PATH_INFO` or `SCRIPT_NAME` intact.

If there are no remaining path segments in `PATH_INFO`, `None` is returned.

Typically, this routine is used to process each portion of a request URI path,
for example to treat the path as a series of dictionary keys. This routine
modifies the passed-in environment to make it suitable for invoking another
WSGI application that is located at the target URI. For example, if there is a
WSGI application at `/foo`, and the request URI path is `/foo/bar/baz`, and
the WSGI application at `/foo` calls `shift_path_info()`, it will receive the
string “bar”, and the environment will be updated to be suitable for passing
to a WSGI application at `/foo/bar`. That is, `SCRIPT_NAME` will change from
`/foo` to `/foo/bar`, and `PATH_INFO` will change from `/bar/baz` to `/baz`.

When `PATH_INFO` is just a “/”, this routine returns an empty string and
appends a trailing slash to `SCRIPT_NAME`, even though empty path segments are
normally ignored, and `SCRIPT_NAME` doesn’t normally end in a slash. This is
intentional behavior, to ensure that an application can tell the difference
between URIs ending in `/x` from ones ending in `/x/` when using this routine
to do object traversal.

`wsgiref.util.setup_testing_defaults(environ)`

    
Update environ with trivial defaults for testing purposes.

This routine adds various parameters required for WSGI, including `HTTP_HOST`,
`SERVER_NAME`, `SERVER_PORT`, `REQUEST_METHOD`, `SCRIPT_NAME`, `PATH_INFO`,
and all of the PEP 3333-defined `wsgi.*` variables. It only supplies default
values, and does not replace any existing settings for these variables.

This routine is intended to make it easier for unit tests of WSGI servers and
applications to set up dummy environments. It should NOT be used by actual
WSGI servers or applications, since the data is fake!

Example usage:

    
    from wsgiref.util import setup_testing_defaults
    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
    
    # A relatively simple WSGI application. It's going to print out the
    # environment dictionary after being updated by setup_testing_defaults
    def simple_app(environ, start_response):
        setup_testing_defaults(environ)
    
        status = '200 OK'
        headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8')]
    
        start_response(status, headers)
    
        ret = [("%s: %s\n" % (key, value)).encode("utf-8")
               for key, value in environ.items()]
        return ret
    
    with make_server('', 8000, simple_app) as httpd:
        print("Serving on port 8000...")
        httpd.serve_forever()
    
In addition to the environment functions above, the `wsgiref.util` module also
provides these miscellaneous utilities:

`wsgiref.util.is_hop_by_hop(header_name)`

    
Return `True` if ‘header_name’ is an HTTP/1.1 “Hop-by-Hop” header, as defined
by RFC 2616.

`class wsgiref.util.FileWrapper(filelike, blksize=8192)`

    
A wrapper to convert a file-like object to an iterator. The resulting objects
support both `__getitem__()` and `__iter__()` iteration styles, for
compatibility with Python 2.1 and Jython. As the object is iterated over, the
optional blksize parameter will be repeatedly passed to the filelike object’s
`read()` method to obtain bytestrings to yield. When `read()` returns an empty
bytestring, iteration is ended and is not resumable.

If filelike has a `close()` method, the returned object will also have a
`close()` method, and it will invoke the filelike object’s `close()` method
when called.

Example usage:

    
    from io import StringIO
    from wsgiref.util import FileWrapper
    
    # We're using a StringIO-buffer for as the file-like object
    filelike = StringIO("This is an example file-like object"*10)
    wrapper = FileWrapper(filelike, blksize=5)
    
    for chunk in wrapper:
        print(chunk)
    
Deprecated since version 3.8: Support for `sequence protocol` is deprecated.

## wsgiref.headers – WSGI response header tools

This module provides a single class, `Headers`, for convenient manipulation of
WSGI response headers using a mapping-like interface.

`class wsgiref.headers.Headers([headers])`

    
Create a mapping-like object wrapping headers, which must be a list of header
name/value tuples as described in PEP 3333. The default value of headers is an
empty list.

`Headers` objects support typical mapping operations including
`__getitem__()`, `get()`, `__setitem__()`, `setdefault()`, `__delitem__()` and
`__contains__()`. For each of these methods, the key is the header name
(treated case-insensitively), and the value is the first value associated with
that header name. Setting a header deletes any existing values for that
header, then adds a new value at the end of the wrapped header list. Headers’
existing order is generally maintained, with new headers added to the end of
the wrapped list.

Unlike a dictionary, `Headers` objects do not raise an error when you try to
get or delete a key that isn’t in the wrapped header list. Getting a
nonexistent header just returns `None`, and deleting a nonexistent header does
nothing.

`Headers` objects also support `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()` methods.
The lists returned by `keys()` and `items()` can include the same key more
than once if there is a multi-valued header. The `len()` of a `Headers` object
is the same as the length of its `items()`, which is the same as the length of
the wrapped header list. In fact, the `items()` method just returns a copy of
the wrapped header list.

Calling `bytes()` on a `Headers` object returns a formatted bytestring
suitable for transmission as HTTP response headers. Each header is placed on a
line with its value, separated by a colon and a space. Each line is terminated
by a carriage return and line feed, and the bytestring is terminated with a
blank line.

In addition to their mapping interface and formatting features, `Headers`
objects also have the following methods for querying and adding multi-valued
headers, and for adding headers with MIME parameters:

`get_all(name)`

    
Return a list of all the values for the named header.

The returned list will be sorted in the order they appeared in the original
header list or were added to this instance, and may contain duplicates. Any
fields deleted and re-inserted are always appended to the header list. If no
fields exist with the given name, returns an empty list.

`add_header(name, value, **_params)`

    
Add a (possibly multi-valued) header, with optional MIME parameters specified
via keyword arguments.

name is the header field to add. Keyword arguments can be used to set MIME
parameters for the header field. Each parameter must be a string or `None`.
Underscores in parameter names are converted to dashes, since dashes are
illegal in Python identifiers, but many MIME parameter names include dashes.
If the parameter value is a string, it is added to the header value parameters
in the form `name="value"`. If it is `None`, only the parameter name is added.
(This is used for MIME parameters without a value.) Example usage:

    
    h.add_header('content-disposition', 'attachment', filename='bud.gif')
    
The above will add a header that looks like this:

    
    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="bud.gif"
    
Changed in version 3.5: headers parameter is optional.

## wsgiref.simple_server – a simple WSGI HTTP server

This module implements a simple HTTP server (based on `http.server`) that
serves WSGI applications. Each server instance serves a single WSGI
application on a given host and port. If you want to serve multiple
applications on a single host and port, you should create a WSGI application
that parses `PATH_INFO` to select which application to invoke for each
request. (E.g., using the `shift_path_info()` function from `wsgiref.util`.)

`wsgiref.simple_server.make_server(host, port, app, server_class=WSGIServer,
handler_class=WSGIRequestHandler)`

    
Create a new WSGI server listening on host and port, accepting connections for
app. The return value is an instance of the supplied server_class, and will
process requests using the specified handler_class. app must be a WSGI
application object, as defined by PEP 3333.

Example usage:

    
    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server, demo_app
    
    with make_server('', 8000, demo_app) as httpd:
        print("Serving HTTP on port 8000...")
    
        # Respond to requests until process is killed
        httpd.serve_forever()
    
        # Alternative: serve one request, then exit
        httpd.handle_request()
    
`wsgiref.simple_server.demo_app(environ, start_response)`

    
This function is a small but complete WSGI application that returns a text
page containing the message “Hello world!” and a list of the key/value pairs
provided in the environ parameter. It’s useful for verifying that a WSGI
server (such as `wsgiref.simple_server`) is able to run a simple WSGI
application correctly.

`class wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass)`

    
Create a `WSGIServer` instance. server_address should be a `(host,port)`
tuple, and RequestHandlerClass should be the subclass of
`http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler` that will be used to process requests.

You do not normally need to call this constructor, as the `make_server()`
function can handle all the details for you.

`WSGIServer` is a subclass of `http.server.HTTPServer`, so all of its methods
(such as `serve_forever()` and `handle_request()`) are available. `WSGIServer`
also provides these WSGI-specific methods:

`set_app(application)`

    
Sets the callable application as the WSGI application that will receive
requests.

`get_app()`

    
Returns the currently-set application callable.

Normally, however, you do not need to use these additional methods, as
`set_app()` is normally called by `make_server()`, and the `get_app()` exists
mainly for the benefit of request handler instances.

`class wsgiref.simple_server.WSGIRequestHandler(request, client_address,
server)`

    
Create an HTTP handler for the given request (i.e. a socket), client_address
(a `(host,port)` tuple), and server (`WSGIServer` instance).

You do not need to create instances of this class directly; they are
automatically created as needed by `WSGIServer` objects. You can, however,
subclass this class and supply it as a handler_class to the `make_server()`
function. Some possibly relevant methods for overriding in subclasses:

`get_environ()`

    
Returns a dictionary containing the WSGI environment for a request. The
default implementation copies the contents of the `WSGIServer` object’s
`base_environ` dictionary attribute and then adds various headers derived from
the HTTP request. Each call to this method should return a new dictionary
containing all of the relevant CGI environment variables as specified in PEP
3333.

`get_stderr()`

    
Return the object that should be used as the `wsgi.errors` stream. The default
implementation just returns `sys.stderr`.

`handle()`

    
Process the HTTP request. The default implementation creates a handler
instance using a `wsgiref.handlers` class to implement the actual WSGI
application interface.

## wsgiref.validate — WSGI conformance checker

When creating new WSGI application objects, frameworks, servers, or
middleware, it can be useful to validate the new code’s conformance using
`wsgiref.validate`. This module provides a function that creates WSGI
application objects that validate communications between a WSGI server or
gateway and a WSGI application object, to check both sides for protocol
conformance.

Note that this utility does not guarantee complete PEP 3333 compliance; an
absence of errors from this module does not necessarily mean that errors do
not exist. However, if this module does produce an error, then it is virtually
certain that either the server or application is not 100% compliant.

This module is based on the `paste.lint` module from Ian Bicking’s “Python
Paste” library.

`wsgiref.validate.validator(application)`

    
Wrap application and return a new WSGI application object. The returned
application will forward all requests to the original application, and will
check that both the application and the server invoking it are conforming to
the WSGI specification and to RFC 2616.

Any detected nonconformance results in an `AssertionError` being raised; note,
however, that how these errors are handled is server-dependent. For example,
`wsgiref.simple_server` and other servers based on `wsgiref.handlers` (that
don’t override the error handling methods to do something else) will simply
output a message that an error has occurred, and dump the traceback to
`sys.stderr` or some other error stream.

This wrapper may also generate output using the `warnings` module to indicate
behaviors that are questionable but which may not actually be prohibited by
PEP 3333. Unless they are suppressed using Python command-line options or the
`warnings` API, any such warnings will be written to `sys.stderr` (not
`wsgi.errors`, unless they happen to be the same object).

Example usage:

    
    from wsgiref.validate import validator
    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
    
    # Our callable object which is intentionally not compliant to the
    # standard, so the validator is going to break
    def simple_app(environ, start_response):
        status = '200 OK'  # HTTP Status
        headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')]  # HTTP Headers
        start_response(status, headers)
    
        # This is going to break because we need to return a list, and
        # the validator is going to inform us
        return b"Hello World"
    
    # This is the application wrapped in a validator
    validator_app = validator(simple_app)
    
    with make_server('', 8000, validator_app) as httpd:
        print("Listening on port 8000....")
        httpd.serve_forever()
    
## wsgiref.handlers – server/gateway base classes

This module provides base handler classes for implementing WSGI servers and
gateways. These base classes handle most of the work of communicating with a
WSGI application, as long as they are given a CGI-like environment, along with
input, output, and error streams.

`class wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler`

    
CGI-based invocation via `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, `sys.stderr` and
`os.environ`. This is useful when you have a WSGI application and want to run
it as a CGI script. Simply invoke `CGIHandler().run(app)`, where `app` is the
WSGI application object you wish to invoke.

This class is a subclass of `BaseCGIHandler` that sets `wsgi.run_once` to
true, `wsgi.multithread` to false, and `wsgi.multiprocess` to true, and always
uses `sys` and `os` to obtain the necessary CGI streams and environment.

`class wsgiref.handlers.IISCGIHandler`

    
A specialized alternative to `CGIHandler`, for use when deploying on
Microsoft’s IIS web server, without having set the config allowPathInfo option
(IIS>=7) or metabase allowPathInfoForScriptMappings (IIS<7).

By default, IIS gives a `PATH_INFO` that duplicates the `SCRIPT_NAME` at the
front, causing problems for WSGI applications that wish to implement routing.
This handler strips any such duplicated path.

IIS can be configured to pass the correct `PATH_INFO`, but this causes another
bug where `PATH_TRANSLATED` is wrong. Luckily this variable is rarely used and
is not guaranteed by WSGI. On IIS<7, though, the setting can only be made on a
vhost level, affecting all other script mappings, many of which break when
exposed to the `PATH_TRANSLATED` bug. For this reason IIS<7 is almost never
deployed with the fix (Even IIS7 rarely uses it because there is still no UI
for it.).

There is no way for CGI code to tell whether the option was set, so a separate
handler class is provided. It is used in the same way as `CGIHandler`, i.e.,
by calling `IISCGIHandler().run(app)`, where `app` is the WSGI application
object you wish to invoke.

New in version 3.2.

`class wsgiref.handlers.BaseCGIHandler(stdin, stdout, stderr, environ,
multithread=True, multiprocess=False)`

    
Similar to `CGIHandler`, but instead of using the `sys` and `os` modules, the
CGI environment and I/O streams are specified explicitly. The multithread and
multiprocess values are used to set the `wsgi.multithread` and
`wsgi.multiprocess` flags for any applications run by the handler instance.

This class is a subclass of `SimpleHandler` intended for use with software
other than HTTP “origin servers”. If you are writing a gateway protocol
implementation (such as CGI, FastCGI, SCGI, etc.) that uses a `Status:` header
to send an HTTP status, you probably want to subclass this instead of
`SimpleHandler`.

`class wsgiref.handlers.SimpleHandler(stdin, stdout, stderr, environ,
multithread=True, multiprocess=False)`

    
Similar to `BaseCGIHandler`, but designed for use with HTTP origin servers. If
you are writing an HTTP server implementation, you will probably want to
subclass this instead of `BaseCGIHandler`.

This class is a subclass of `BaseHandler`. It overrides the `__init__()`,
`get_stdin()`, `get_stderr()`, `add_cgi_vars()`, `_write()`, and `_flush()`
methods to support explicitly setting the environment and streams via the
constructor. The supplied environment and streams are stored in the `stdin`,
`stdout`, `stderr`, and `environ` attributes.

The `write()` method of stdout should write each chunk in full, like
`io.BufferedIOBase`.

`class wsgiref.handlers.BaseHandler`

    
This is an abstract base class for running WSGI applications. Each instance
will handle a single HTTP request, although in principle you could create a
subclass that was reusable for multiple requests.

`BaseHandler` instances have only one method intended for external use:

`run(app)`

    
Run the specified WSGI application, app.

All of the other `BaseHandler` methods are invoked by this method in the
process of running the application, and thus exist primarily to allow
customizing the process.

The following methods MUST be overridden in a subclass:

`_write(data)`

    
Buffer the bytes data for transmission to the client. It’s okay if this method
actually transmits the data; `BaseHandler` just separates write and flush
operations for greater efficiency when the underlying system actually has such
a distinction.

`_flush()`

    
Force buffered data to be transmitted to the client. It’s okay if this method
is a no-op (i.e., if `_write()` actually sends the data).

`get_stdin()`

    
Return an input stream object suitable for use as the `wsgi.input` of the
request currently being processed.

`get_stderr()`

    
Return an output stream object suitable for use as the `wsgi.errors` of the
request currently being processed.

`add_cgi_vars()`

    
Insert CGI variables for the current request into the `environ` attribute.

Here are some other methods and attributes you may wish to override. This list
is only a summary, however, and does not include every method that can be
overridden. You should consult the docstrings and source code for additional
information before attempting to create a customized `BaseHandler` subclass.

Attributes and methods for customizing the WSGI environment:

`wsgi_multithread`

    
The value to be used for the `wsgi.multithread` environment variable. It
defaults to true in `BaseHandler`, but may have a different default (or be set
by the constructor) in the other subclasses.

`wsgi_multiprocess`

    
The value to be used for the `wsgi.multiprocess` environment variable. It
defaults to true in `BaseHandler`, but may have a different default (or be set
by the constructor) in the other subclasses.

`wsgi_run_once`

    
The value to be used for the `wsgi.run_once` environment variable. It defaults
to false in `BaseHandler`, but `CGIHandler` sets it to true by default.

`os_environ`

    
The default environment variables to be included in every request’s WSGI
environment. By default, this is a copy of `os.environ` at the time that
`wsgiref.handlers` was imported, but subclasses can either create their own at
the class or instance level. Note that the dictionary should be considered
read-only, since the default value is shared between multiple classes and
instances.

`server_software`

    
If the `origin_server` attribute is set, this attribute’s value is used to set
the default `SERVER_SOFTWARE` WSGI environment variable, and also to set a
default `Server:` header in HTTP responses. It is ignored for handlers (such
as `BaseCGIHandler` and `CGIHandler`) that are not HTTP origin servers.

Changed in version 3.3: The term “Python” is replaced with implementation
specific term like “CPython”, “Jython” etc.

`get_scheme()`

    
Return the URL scheme being used for the current request. The default
implementation uses the `guess_scheme()` function from `wsgiref.util` to guess
whether the scheme should be “http” or “https”, based on the current request’s
`environ` variables.

`setup_environ()`

    
Set the `environ` attribute to a fully-populated WSGI environment. The default
implementation uses all of the above methods and attributes, plus the
`get_stdin()`, `get_stderr()`, and `add_cgi_vars()` methods and the
`wsgi_file_wrapper` attribute. It also inserts a `SERVER_SOFTWARE` key if not
present, as long as the `origin_server` attribute is a true value and the
`server_software` attribute is set.

Methods and attributes for customizing exception handling:

`log_exception(exc_info)`

    
Log the exc_info tuple in the server log. exc_info is a `(type, value,
traceback)` tuple. The default implementation simply writes the traceback to
the request’s `wsgi.errors` stream and flushes it. Subclasses can override
this method to change the format or retarget the output, mail the traceback to
an administrator, or whatever other action may be deemed suitable.

`traceback_limit`

    
The maximum number of frames to include in tracebacks output by the default
`log_exception()` method. If `None`, all frames are included.

`error_output(environ, start_response)`

    
This method is a WSGI application to generate an error page for the user. It
is only invoked if an error occurs before headers are sent to the client.

This method can access the current error information using `sys.exc_info()`,
and should pass that information to start_response when calling it (as
described in the “Error Handling” section of PEP 3333).

The default implementation just uses the `error_status`, `error_headers`, and
`error_body` attributes to generate an output page. Subclasses can override
this to produce more dynamic error output.

Note, however, that it’s not recommended from a security perspective to spit
out diagnostics to any old user; ideally, you should have to do something
special to enable diagnostic output, which is why the default implementation
doesn’t include any.

`error_status`

    
The HTTP status used for error responses. This should be a status string as
defined in PEP 3333; it defaults to a 500 code and message.

`error_headers`

    
The HTTP headers used for error responses. This should be a list of WSGI
response headers (`(name, value)` tuples), as described in PEP 3333. The
default list just sets the content type to `text/plain`.

`error_body`

    
The error response body. This should be an HTTP response body bytestring. It
defaults to the plain text, “A server error occurred. Please contact the
administrator.”

Methods and attributes for PEP 3333’s “Optional Platform-Specific File
Handling” feature:

`wsgi_file_wrapper`

    
A `wsgi.file_wrapper` factory, or `None`. The default value of this attribute
is the `wsgiref.util.FileWrapper` class.

`sendfile()`

    
Override to implement platform-specific file transmission. This method is
called only if the application’s return value is an instance of the class
specified by the `wsgi_file_wrapper` attribute. It should return a true value
if it was able to successfully transmit the file, so that the default
transmission code will not be executed. The default implementation of this
method just returns a false value.

Miscellaneous methods and attributes:

`origin_server`

    
This attribute should be set to a true value if the handler’s `_write()` and
`_flush()` are being used to communicate directly to the client, rather than
via a CGI-like gateway protocol that wants the HTTP status in a special
`Status:` header.

This attribute’s default value is true in `BaseHandler`, but false in
`BaseCGIHandler` and `CGIHandler`.

`http_version`

    
If `origin_server` is true, this string attribute is used to set the HTTP
version of the response set to the client. It defaults to `"1.0"`.

`wsgiref.handlers.read_environ()`

    
Transcode CGI variables from `os.environ` to PEP 3333 “bytes in unicode”
strings, returning a new dictionary. This function is used by `CGIHandler` and
`IISCGIHandler` in place of directly using `os.environ`, which is not
necessarily WSGI-compliant on all platforms and web servers using Python 3 –
specifically, ones where the OS’s actual environment is Unicode (i.e.
Windows), or ones where the environment is bytes, but the system encoding used
by Python to decode it is anything other than ISO-8859-1 (e.g. Unix systems
using UTF-8).

If you are implementing a CGI-based handler of your own, you probably want to
use this routine instead of just copying values out of `os.environ` directly.

New in version 3.2.

## Examples

This is a working “Hello World” WSGI application:

    
    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
    
    # Every WSGI application must have an application object - a callable
    # object that accepts two arguments. For that purpose, we're going to
    # use a function (note that you're not limited to a function, you can
    # use a class for example). The first argument passed to the function
    # is a dictionary containing CGI-style environment variables and the
    # second variable is the callable object.
    def hello_world_app(environ, start_response):
        status = '200 OK'  # HTTP Status

    Small wsgiref based web server. Takes a path to serve from and an
    optional port number (defaults to 8000), then tries to serve files.
    Mime types are guessed from the file names, 404 errors are raised
    if the file is not found. Used for the make serve target in Doc.
