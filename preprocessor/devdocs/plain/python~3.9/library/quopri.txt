# quopri — Encode and decode MIME quoted-printable data

Source code: Lib/quopri.py

This module performs quoted-printable transport encoding and decoding, as
defined in RFC 1521: “MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One:
Mechanisms for Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message
Bodies”. The quoted-printable encoding is designed for data where there are
relatively few nonprintable characters; the base64 encoding scheme available
via the `base64` module is more compact if there are many such characters, as
when sending a graphics file.

`quopri.decode(input, output, header=False)`

    
Decode the contents of the input file and write the resulting decoded binary
data to the output file. input and output must be binary file objects. If the
optional argument header is present and true, underscore will be decoded as
space. This is used to decode “Q”-encoded headers as described in RFC 1522:
“MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part Two: Message Header
Extensions for Non-ASCII Text”.

`quopri.encode(input, output, quotetabs, header=False)`

    
Encode the contents of the input file and write the resulting quoted-printable
data to the output file. input and output must be binary file objects.
quotetabs, a non-optional flag which controls whether to encode embedded
spaces and tabs; when true it encodes such embedded whitespace, and when false
it leaves them unencoded. Note that spaces and tabs appearing at the end of
lines are always encoded, as per RFC 1521. header is a flag which controls if
spaces are encoded as underscores as per RFC 1522.

`quopri.decodestring(s, header=False)`

    
Like `decode()`, except that it accepts a source `bytes` and returns the
corresponding decoded `bytes`.

`quopri.encodestring(s, quotetabs=False, header=False)`

    
Like `encode()`, except that it accepts a source `bytes` and returns the
corresponding encoded `bytes`. By default, it sends a `False` value to
quotetabs parameter of the `encode()` function.
