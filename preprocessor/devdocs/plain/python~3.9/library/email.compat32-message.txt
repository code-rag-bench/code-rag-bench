# email.message.Message: Representing an email message using the compat32 API

The `Message` class is very similar to the `EmailMessage` class, without the
methods added by that class, and with the default behavior of certain other
methods being slightly different. We also document here some methods that,
while supported by the `EmailMessage` class, are not recommended unless you
are dealing with legacy code.

The philosophy and structure of the two classes is otherwise the same.

This document describes the behavior under the default (for `Message`) policy
`Compat32`. If you are going to use another policy, you should be using the
`EmailMessage` class instead.

An email message consists of headers and a payload. Headers must be RFC 5322
style names and values, where the field name and value are separated by a
colon. The colon is not part of either the field name or the field value. The
payload may be a simple text message, or a binary object, or a structured
sequence of sub-messages each with their own set of headers and their own
payload. The latter type of payload is indicated by the message having a MIME
type such as multipart/* or message/rfc822.

The conceptual model provided by a `Message` object is that of an ordered
dictionary of headers with additional methods for accessing both specialized
information from the headers, for accessing the payload, for generating a
serialized version of the message, and for recursively walking over the object
tree. Note that duplicate headers are supported but special methods must be
used to access them.

The `Message` pseudo-dictionary is indexed by the header names, which must be
ASCII values. The values of the dictionary are strings that are supposed to
contain only ASCII characters; there is some special handling for non-ASCII
input, but it doesn’t always produce the correct results. Headers are stored
and returned in case-preserving form, but field names are matched case-
insensitively. There may also be a single envelope header, also known as the
Unix-From header or the `From_` header. The payload is either a string or
bytes, in the case of simple message objects, or a list of `Message` objects,
for MIME container documents (e.g. multipart/* and message/rfc822).

Here are the methods of the `Message` class:

`class email.message.Message(policy=compat32)`

    
If policy is specified (it must be an instance of a `policy` class) use the
rules it specifies to update and serialize the representation of the message.
If policy is not set, use the `compat32` policy, which maintains backward
compatibility with the Python 3.2 version of the email package. For more
information see the `policy` documentation.

Changed in version 3.3: The policy keyword argument was added.

`as_string(unixfrom=False, maxheaderlen=0, policy=None)`

    
Return the entire message flattened as a string. When optional unixfrom is
true, the envelope header is included in the returned string. unixfrom
defaults to `False`. For backward compatibility reasons, maxheaderlen defaults
to `0`, so if you want a different value you must override it explicitly (the
value specified for max_line_length in the policy will be ignored by this
method). The policy argument may be used to override the default policy
obtained from the message instance. This can be used to control some of the
formatting produced by the method, since the specified policy will be passed
to the `Generator`.

Flattening the message may trigger changes to the `Message` if defaults need
to be filled in to complete the transformation to a string (for example, MIME
boundaries may be generated or modified).

Note that this method is provided as a convenience and may not always format
the message the way you want. For example, by default it does not do the
mangling of lines that begin with `From` that is required by the unix mbox
format. For more flexibility, instantiate a `Generator` instance and use its
`flatten()` method directly. For example:

    
    from io import StringIO
    from email.generator import Generator
    fp = StringIO()
    g = Generator(fp, mangle_from_=True, maxheaderlen=60)
    g.flatten(msg)
    text = fp.getvalue()
    
If the message object contains binary data that is not encoded according to
RFC standards, the non-compliant data will be replaced by unicode “unknown
character” code points. (See also `as_bytes()` and `BytesGenerator`.)

Changed in version 3.4: the policy keyword argument was added.

`__str__()`

    
Equivalent to `as_string()`. Allows `str(msg)` to produce a string containing
the formatted message.

`as_bytes(unixfrom=False, policy=None)`

    
Return the entire message flattened as a bytes object. When optional unixfrom
is true, the envelope header is included in the returned string. unixfrom
defaults to `False`. The policy argument may be used to override the default
policy obtained from the message instance. This can be used to control some of
the formatting produced by the method, since the specified policy will be
passed to the `BytesGenerator`.

Flattening the message may trigger changes to the `Message` if defaults need
to be filled in to complete the transformation to a string (for example, MIME
boundaries may be generated or modified).

Note that this method is provided as a convenience and may not always format
the message the way you want. For example, by default it does not do the
mangling of lines that begin with `From` that is required by the unix mbox
format. For more flexibility, instantiate a `BytesGenerator` instance and use
its `flatten()` method directly. For example:

    
    from io import BytesIO
    from email.generator import BytesGenerator
    fp = BytesIO()
    g = BytesGenerator(fp, mangle_from_=True, maxheaderlen=60)
    g.flatten(msg)
    text = fp.getvalue()
    
New in version 3.4.

`__bytes__()`

    
Equivalent to `as_bytes()`. Allows `bytes(msg)` to produce a bytes object
containing the formatted message.

New in version 3.4.

`is_multipart()`

    
Return `True` if the message’s payload is a list of sub-`Message` objects,
otherwise return `False`. When `is_multipart()` returns `False`, the payload
should be a string object (which might be a CTE encoded binary payload). (Note
that `is_multipart()` returning `True` does not necessarily mean that
“msg.get_content_maintype() == ‘multipart’” will return the `True`. For
example, `is_multipart` will return `True` when the `Message` is of type
`message/rfc822`.)

`set_unixfrom(unixfrom)`

    
Set the message’s envelope header to unixfrom, which should be a string.

`get_unixfrom()`

    
Return the message’s envelope header. Defaults to `None` if the envelope
header was never set.

`attach(payload)`

    
Add the given payload to the current payload, which must be `None` or a list
of `Message` objects before the call. After the call, the payload will always
be a list of `Message` objects. If you want to set the payload to a scalar
object (e.g. a string), use `set_payload()` instead.

This is a legacy method. On the `EmailMessage` class its functionality is
replaced by `set_content()` and the related `make` and `add` methods.

`get_payload(i=None, decode=False)`

    
Return the current payload, which will be a list of `Message` objects when
`is_multipart()` is `True`, or a string when `is_multipart()` is `False`. If
the payload is a list and you mutate the list object, you modify the message’s
payload in place.

With optional argument i, `get_payload()` will return the i-th element of the
payload, counting from zero, if `is_multipart()` is `True`. An `IndexError`
will be raised if i is less than 0 or greater than or equal to the number of
items in the payload. If the payload is a string (i.e. `is_multipart()` is
`False`) and i is given, a `TypeError` is raised.

Optional decode is a flag indicating whether the payload should be decoded or
not, according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding header. When `True` and the
message is not a multipart, the payload will be decoded if this header’s value
is `quoted-printable` or `base64`. If some other encoding is used, or Content-
Transfer-Encoding header is missing, the payload is returned as-is
(undecoded). In all cases the returned value is binary data. If the message is
a multipart and the decode flag is `True`, then `None` is returned. If the
payload is base64 and it was not perfectly formed (missing padding, characters
outside the base64 alphabet), then an appropriate defect will be added to the
message’s defect property (`InvalidBase64PaddingDefect` or
`InvalidBase64CharactersDefect`, respectively).

When decode is `False` (the default) the body is returned as a string without
decoding the Content-Transfer-Encoding. However, for a Content-Transfer-
Encoding of 8bit, an attempt is made to decode the original bytes using the
`charset` specified by the Content-Type header, using the `replace` error
handler. If no `charset` is specified, or if the `charset` given is not
recognized by the email package, the body is decoded using the default ASCII
charset.

This is a legacy method. On the `EmailMessage` class its functionality is
replaced by `get_content()` and `iter_parts()`.

`set_payload(payload, charset=None)`

    
Set the entire message object’s payload to payload. It is the client’s
responsibility to ensure the payload invariants. Optional charset sets the
message’s default character set; see `set_charset()` for details.

This is a legacy method. On the `EmailMessage` class its functionality is
replaced by `set_content()`.

`set_charset(charset)`

    
Set the character set of the payload to charset, which can either be a
`Charset` instance (see `email.charset`), a string naming a character set, or
`None`. If it is a string, it will be converted to a `Charset` instance. If
charset is `None`, the `charset` parameter will be removed from the Content-
Type header (the message will not be otherwise modified). Anything else will
generate a `TypeError`.

If there is no existing MIME-Version header one will be added. If there is no
existing Content-Type header, one will be added with a value of text/plain.
Whether the Content-Type header already exists or not, its `charset` parameter
will be set to charset.output_charset. If charset.input_charset and
charset.output_charset differ, the payload will be re-encoded to the
output_charset. If there is no existing Content-Transfer-Encoding header, then
the payload will be transfer-encoded, if needed, using the specified
`Charset`, and a header with the appropriate value will be added. If a
Content-Transfer-Encoding header already exists, the payload is assumed to
already be correctly encoded using that Content-Transfer-Encoding and is not
modified.

This is a legacy method. On the `EmailMessage` class its functionality is
replaced by the charset parameter of the
`email.emailmessage.EmailMessage.set_content()` method.

`get_charset()`

    
Return the `Charset` instance associated with the message’s payload.

This is a legacy method. On the `EmailMessage` class it always returns `None`.

The following methods implement a mapping-like interface for accessing the
message’s RFC 2822 headers. Note that there are some semantic differences
between these methods and a normal mapping (i.e. dictionary) interface. For
example, in a dictionary there are no duplicate keys, but here there may be
duplicate message headers. Also, in dictionaries there is no guaranteed order
to the keys returned by `keys()`, but in a `Message` object, headers are
always returned in the order they appeared in the original message, or were
added to the message later. Any header deleted and then re-added are always
appended to the end of the header list.

These semantic differences are intentional and are biased toward maximal
convenience.

Note that in all cases, any envelope header present in the message is not
included in the mapping interface.

In a model generated from bytes, any header values that (in contravention of
the RFCs) contain non-ASCII bytes will, when retrieved through this interface,
be represented as `Header` objects with a charset of `unknown-8bit`.

`__len__()`

    
Return the total number of headers, including duplicates.

`__contains__(name)`

    
Return `True` if the message object has a field named name. Matching is done
case-insensitively and name should not include the trailing colon. Used for
the `in` operator, e.g.:

    
    if 'message-id' in myMessage:
       print('Message-ID:', myMessage['message-id'])
    
`__getitem__(name)`

    
Return the value of the named header field. name should not include the colon
field separator. If the header is missing, `None` is returned; a `KeyError` is
never raised.

Note that if the named field appears more than once in the message’s headers,
exactly which of those field values will be returned is undefined. Use the
`get_all()` method to get the values of all the extant named headers.

`__setitem__(name, val)`

    
Add a header to the message with field name name and value val. The field is
appended to the end of the message’s existing fields.

Note that this does not overwrite or delete any existing header with the same
name. If you want to ensure that the new header is the only one present in the
message with field name name, delete the field first, e.g.:

    
    del msg['subject']
    msg['subject'] = 'Python roolz!'
    
`__delitem__(name)`

    
Delete all occurrences of the field with name name from the message’s headers.
No exception is raised if the named field isn’t present in the headers.

`keys()`

    
Return a list of all the message’s header field names.

`values()`

    
Return a list of all the message’s field values.

`items()`

    
Return a list of 2-tuples containing all the message’s field headers and
values.

`get(name, failobj=None)`

    
Return the value of the named header field. This is identical to
`__getitem__()` except that optional failobj is returned if the named header
is missing (defaults to `None`).

Here are some additional useful methods:

`get_all(name, failobj=None)`

    
Return a list of all the values for the field named name. If there are no such
named headers in the message, failobj is returned (defaults to `None`).

`add_header(_name, _value, **_params)`

    
Extended header setting. This method is similar to `__setitem__()` except that
additional header parameters can be provided as keyword arguments. _name is
the header field to add and _value is the primary value for the header.

For each item in the keyword argument dictionary _params, the key is taken as
the parameter name, with underscores converted to dashes (since dashes are
illegal in Python identifiers). Normally, the parameter will be added as
`key="value"` unless the value is `None`, in which case only the key will be
added. If the value contains non-ASCII characters, it can be specified as a
three tuple in the format `(CHARSET, LANGUAGE, VALUE)`, where `CHARSET` is a
string naming the charset to be used to encode the value, `LANGUAGE` can
usually be set to `None` or the empty string (see RFC 2231 for other
possibilities), and `VALUE` is the string value containing non-ASCII code
points. If a three tuple is not passed and the value contains non-ASCII
characters, it is automatically encoded in RFC 2231 format using a `CHARSET`
of `utf-8` and a `LANGUAGE` of `None`.

Here’s an example:

    
    msg.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment', filename='bud.gif')
    
This will add a header that looks like

    
    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="bud.gif"
    
An example with non-ASCII characters:

    
    msg.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment',
                   filename=('iso-8859-1', '', 'Fußballer.ppt'))
    
Which produces

    
    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*="iso-8859-1''Fu%DFballer.ppt"
    
`replace_header(_name, _value)`

    
Replace a header. Replace the first header found in the message that matches
_name, retaining header order and field name case. If no matching header was
found, a `KeyError` is raised.

`get_content_type()`

    
Return the message’s content type. The returned string is coerced to lower
case of the form maintype/subtype. If there was no Content-Type header in the
message the default type as given by `get_default_type()` will be returned.
Since according to RFC 2045, messages always have a default type,
`get_content_type()` will always return a value.

RFC 2045 defines a message’s default type to be text/plain unless it appears
inside a multipart/digest container, in which case it would be message/rfc822.
If the Content-Type header has an invalid type specification, RFC 2045
mandates that the default type be text/plain.

`get_content_maintype()`

    
Return the message’s main content type. This is the maintype part of the
string returned by `get_content_type()`.

`get_content_subtype()`

    
Return the message’s sub-content type. This is the subtype part of the string
returned by `get_content_type()`.

`get_default_type()`

    
Return the default content type. Most messages have a default content type of
text/plain, except for messages that are subparts of multipart/digest
containers. Such subparts have a default content type of message/rfc822.

`set_default_type(ctype)`

    
Set the default content type. ctype should either be text/plain or
message/rfc822, although this is not enforced. The default content type is not
stored in the Content-Type header.

`get_params(failobj=None, header='content-type', unquote=True)`

    
Return the message’s Content-Type parameters, as a list. The elements of the
returned list are 2-tuples of key/value pairs, as split on the `'='` sign. The
left hand side of the `'='` is the key, while the right hand side is the
value. If there is no `'='` sign in the parameter the value is the empty
string, otherwise the value is as described in `get_param()` and is unquoted
if optional unquote is `True` (the default).

Optional failobj is the object to return if there is no Content-Type header.
Optional header is the header to search instead of Content-Type.

This is a legacy method. On the `EmailMessage` class its functionality is
replaced by the params property of the individual header objects returned by
the header access methods.

`get_param(param, failobj=None, header='content-type', unquote=True)`

    
Return the value of the Content-Type header’s parameter param as a string. If
the message has no Content-Type header or if there is no such parameter, then
failobj is returned (defaults to `None`).

Optional header if given, specifies the message header to use instead of
Content-Type.

Parameter keys are always compared case insensitively. The return value can
either be a string, or a 3-tuple if the parameter was RFC 2231 encoded. When
it’s a 3-tuple, the elements of the value are of the form `(CHARSET, LANGUAGE,
VALUE)`. Note that both `CHARSET` and `LANGUAGE` can be `None`, in which case
you should consider `VALUE` to be encoded in the `us-ascii` charset. You can
usually ignore `LANGUAGE`.

If your application doesn’t care whether the parameter was encoded as in RFC
2231, you can collapse the parameter value by calling
`email.utils.collapse_rfc2231_value()`, passing in the return value from
`get_param()`. This will return a suitably decoded Unicode string when the
value is a tuple, or the original string unquoted if it isn’t. For example:

    
    rawparam = msg.get_param('foo')
    param = email.utils.collapse_rfc2231_value(rawparam)
    
In any case, the parameter value (either the returned string, or the `VALUE`
item in the 3-tuple) is always unquoted, unless unquote is set to `False`.

This is a legacy method. On the `EmailMessage` class its functionality is
replaced by the params property of the individual header objects returned by
the header access methods.

`set_param(param, value, header='Content-Type', requote=True, charset=None,
language='', replace=False)`

    
Set a parameter in the Content-Type header. If the parameter already exists in
the header, its value will be replaced with value. If the Content-Type header
as not yet been defined for this message, it will be set to text/plain and the
new parameter value will be appended as per RFC 2045.

Optional header specifies an alternative header to Content-Type, and all
parameters will be quoted as necessary unless optional requote is `False` (the
default is `True`).

If optional charset is specified, the parameter will be encoded according to
RFC 2231. Optional language specifies the RFC 2231 language, defaulting to the
empty string. Both charset and language should be strings.

If replace is `False` (the default) the header is moved to the end of the list
of headers. If replace is `True`, the header will be updated in place.

Changed in version 3.4: `replace` keyword was added.

`del_param(param, header='content-type', requote=True)`

    
Remove the given parameter completely from the Content-Type header. The header
will be re-written in place without the parameter or its value. All values
will be quoted as necessary unless requote is `False` (the default is `True`).
Optional header specifies an alternative to Content-Type.

`set_type(type, header='Content-Type', requote=True)`

    
Set the main type and subtype for the Content-Type header. type must be a
string in the form maintype/subtype, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised.

This method replaces the Content-Type header, keeping all the parameters in
place. If requote is `False`, this leaves the existing header’s quoting as is,
otherwise the parameters will be quoted (the default).

An alternative header can be specified in the header argument. When the
Content-Type header is set a MIME-Version header is also added.

This is a legacy method. On the `EmailMessage` class its functionality is
replaced by the `make_` and `add_` methods.

`get_filename(failobj=None)`

    
Return the value of the `filename` parameter of the Content-Disposition header
of the message. If the header does not have a `filename` parameter, this
method falls back to looking for the `name` parameter on the Content-Type
header. If neither is found, or the header is missing, then failobj is
returned. The returned string will always be unquoted as per
`email.utils.unquote()`.

`get_boundary(failobj=None)`

    
Return the value of the `boundary` parameter of the Content-Type header of the
message, or failobj if either the header is missing, or has no `boundary`
parameter. The returned string will always be unquoted as per
`email.utils.unquote()`.

`set_boundary(boundary)`

    
Set the `boundary` parameter of the Content-Type header to boundary.
`set_boundary()` will always quote boundary if necessary. A `HeaderParseError`
is raised if the message object has no Content-Type header.

Note that using this method is subtly different than deleting the old Content-
Type header and adding a new one with the new boundary via `add_header()`,
because `set_boundary()` preserves the order of the Content-Type header in the
list of headers. However, it does not preserve any continuation lines which
may have been present in the original Content-Type header.

`get_content_charset(failobj=None)`

    
Return the `charset` parameter of the Content-Type header, coerced to lower
case. If there is no Content-Type header, or if that header has no `charset`
parameter, failobj is returned.

Note that this method differs from `get_charset()` which returns the `Charset`
instance for the default encoding of the message body.

`get_charsets(failobj=None)`

    
Return a list containing the character set names in the message. If the
message is a multipart, then the list will contain one element for each
subpart in the payload, otherwise, it will be a list of length 1.

Each item in the list will be a string which is the value of the `charset`
parameter in the Content-Type header for the represented subpart. However, if
the subpart has no Content-Type header, no `charset` parameter, or is not of
the text main MIME type, then that item in the returned list will be failobj.

`get_content_disposition()`

    
Return the lowercased value (without parameters) of the message’s Content-
Disposition header if it has one, or `None`. The possible values for this
method are inline, attachment or `None` if the message follows RFC 2183.

New in version 3.5.

`walk()`

    
The `walk()` method is an all-purpose generator which can be used to iterate
over all the parts and subparts of a message object tree, in depth-first
traversal order. You will typically use `walk()` as the iterator in a `for`
loop; each iteration returns the next subpart.

Here’s an example that prints the MIME type of every part of a multipart
message structure:

    
    >>> for part in msg.walk():
    ...     print(part.get_content_type())
    multipart/report
    text/plain
    message/delivery-status
    text/plain
    text/plain
    message/rfc822
    text/plain
    
`walk` iterates over the subparts of any part where `is_multipart()` returns
`True`, even though `msg.get_content_maintype() == 'multipart'` may return
`False`. We can see this in our example by making use of the `_structure`
debug helper function:

    
    >>> for part in msg.walk():
    ...     print(part.get_content_maintype() == 'multipart',
    ...           part.is_multipart())
    True True
    False False
    False True
    False False
    False False
    False True
    False False
    >>> _structure(msg)
    multipart/report
        text/plain
        message/delivery-status
            text/plain
            text/plain
        message/rfc822
            text/plain
    
Here the `message` parts are not `multiparts`, but they do contain subparts.
`is_multipart()` returns `True` and `walk` descends into the subparts.

`Message` objects can also optionally contain two instance attributes, which
can be used when generating the plain text of a MIME message.

`preamble`

    
The format of a MIME document allows for some text between the blank line
following the headers, and the first multipart boundary string. Normally, this
text is never visible in a MIME-aware mail reader because it falls outside the
standard MIME armor. However, when viewing the raw text of the message, or
when viewing the message in a non-MIME aware reader, this text can become
visible.

The preamble attribute contains this leading extra-armor text for MIME
documents. When the `Parser` discovers some text after the headers but before
the first boundary string, it assigns this text to the message’s preamble
attribute. When the `Generator` is writing out the plain text representation
of a MIME message, and it finds the message has a preamble attribute, it will
write this text in the area between the headers and the first boundary. See
`email.parser` and `email.generator` for details.

Note that if the message object has no preamble, the preamble attribute will
be `None`.

`epilogue`

    
The epilogue attribute acts the same way as the preamble attribute, except
that it contains text that appears between the last boundary and the end of
the message.

You do not need to set the epilogue to the empty string in order for the
`Generator` to print a newline at the end of the file.

`defects`

    
The defects attribute contains a list of all the problems found when parsing
this message. See `email.errors` for a detailed description of the possible
parsing defects.
