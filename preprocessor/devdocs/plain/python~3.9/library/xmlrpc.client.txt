# xmlrpc.client — XML-RPC client access

Source code: Lib/xmlrpc/client.py

XML-RPC is a Remote Procedure Call method that uses XML passed via HTTP(S) as
a transport. With it, a client can call methods with parameters on a remote
server (the server is named by a URI) and get back structured data. This
module supports writing XML-RPC client code; it handles all the details of
translating between conformable Python objects and XML on the wire.

Warning

The `xmlrpc.client` module is not secure against maliciously constructed data.
If you need to parse untrusted or unauthenticated data see XML
vulnerabilities.

Changed in version 3.5: For HTTPS URIs, `xmlrpc.client` now performs all the
necessary certificate and hostname checks by default.

`class xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy(uri, transport=None, encoding=None,
verbose=False, allow_none=False, use_datetime=False, use_builtin_types=False,
*, headers=(), context=None)`

    
A `ServerProxy` instance is an object that manages communication with a remote
XML-RPC server. The required first argument is a URI (Uniform Resource
Indicator), and will normally be the URL of the server. The optional second
argument is a transport factory instance; by default it is an internal
`SafeTransport` instance for https: URLs and an internal HTTP `Transport`
instance otherwise. The optional third argument is an encoding, by default
UTF-8. The optional fourth argument is a debugging flag.

The following parameters govern the use of the returned proxy instance. If
allow_none is true, the Python constant `None` will be translated into XML;
the default behaviour is for `None` to raise a `TypeError`. This is a
commonly-used extension to the XML-RPC specification, but isn’t supported by
all clients and servers; see http://ontosys.com/xml-rpc/extensions.php for a
description. The use_builtin_types flag can be used to cause date/time values
to be presented as `datetime.datetime` objects and binary data to be presented
as `bytes` objects; this flag is false by default. `datetime.datetime`,
`bytes` and `bytearray` objects may be passed to calls. The headers parameter
is an optional sequence of HTTP headers to send with each request, expressed
as a sequence of 2-tuples representing the header name and value. (e.g.
`[(‘Header-Name’, ‘value’)]`). The obsolete use_datetime flag is similar to
use_builtin_types but it applies only to date/time values.

Changed in version 3.3: The use_builtin_types flag was added.

Changed in version 3.8: The headers parameter was added.

Both the HTTP and HTTPS transports support the URL syntax extension for HTTP
Basic Authentication: `http://user:pass@host:port/path`. The `user:pass`
portion will be base64-encoded as an HTTP ‘Authorization’ header, and sent to
the remote server as part of the connection process when invoking an XML-RPC
method. You only need to use this if the remote server requires a Basic
Authentication user and password. If an HTTPS URL is provided, context may be
`ssl.SSLContext` and configures the SSL settings of the underlying HTTPS
connection.

The returned instance is a proxy object with methods that can be used to
invoke corresponding RPC calls on the remote server. If the remote server
supports the introspection API, the proxy can also be used to query the remote
server for the methods it supports (service discovery) and fetch other server-
associated metadata.

Types that are conformable (e.g. that can be marshalled through XML), include
the following (and except where noted, they are unmarshalled as the same
Python type):

XML-RPC type | Python type  
---|---  
`boolean` | `bool`  
`int`, `i1`, `i2`, `i4`, `i8` or `biginteger` | `int` in range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. Values get the `<int>` tag.  
`double` or `float` | `float`. Values get the `<double>` tag.  
`string` | `str`  
`array` | `list` or `tuple` containing conformable elements. Arrays are returned as `lists`.  
`struct` | `dict`. Keys must be strings, values may be any conformable type. Objects of user-defined classes can be passed in; only their `__dict__` attribute is transmitted.  
`dateTime.iso8601` | `DateTime` or `datetime.datetime`. Returned type depends on values of use_builtin_types and use_datetime flags.  
`base64` | `Binary`, `bytes` or `bytearray`. Returned type depends on the value of the use_builtin_types flag.  
`nil` | The `None` constant. Passing is allowed only if allow_none is true.  
`bigdecimal` | `decimal.Decimal`. Returned type only.  
This is the full set of data types supported by XML-RPC. Method calls may also
raise a special `Fault` instance, used to signal XML-RPC server errors, or
`ProtocolError` used to signal an error in the HTTP/HTTPS transport layer.
Both `Fault` and `ProtocolError` derive from a base class called `Error`. Note
that the xmlrpc client module currently does not marshal instances of
subclasses of built-in types.

When passing strings, characters special to XML such as `<`, `>`, and `&` will
be automatically escaped. However, it’s the caller’s responsibility to ensure
that the string is free of characters that aren’t allowed in XML, such as the
control characters with ASCII values between 0 and 31 (except, of course, tab,
newline and carriage return); failing to do this will result in an XML-RPC
request that isn’t well-formed XML. If you have to pass arbitrary bytes via
XML-RPC, use `bytes` or `bytearray` classes or the `Binary` wrapper class
described below.

`Server` is retained as an alias for `ServerProxy` for backwards
compatibility. New code should use `ServerProxy`.

Changed in version 3.5: Added the context argument.

Changed in version 3.6: Added support of type tags with prefixes (e.g.
`ex:nil`). Added support of unmarshalling additional types used by Apache XML-
RPC implementation for numerics: `i1`, `i2`, `i8`, `biginteger`, `float` and
`bigdecimal`. See http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/types.html for a description.

## ServerProxy Objects

A `ServerProxy` instance has a method corresponding to each remote procedure
call accepted by the XML-RPC server. Calling the method performs an RPC,
dispatched by both name and argument signature (e.g. the same method name can
be overloaded with multiple argument signatures). The RPC finishes by
returning a value, which may be either returned data in a conformant type or a
`Fault` or `ProtocolError` object indicating an error.

Servers that support the XML introspection API support some common methods
grouped under the reserved `system` attribute:

`ServerProxy.system.listMethods()`

    
This method returns a list of strings, one for each (non-system) method
supported by the XML-RPC server.

`ServerProxy.system.methodSignature(name)`

    
This method takes one parameter, the name of a method implemented by the XML-
RPC server. It returns an array of possible signatures for this method. A
signature is an array of types. The first of these types is the return type of
the method, the rest are parameters.

Because multiple signatures (ie. overloading) is permitted, this method
returns a list of signatures rather than a singleton.

Signatures themselves are restricted to the top level parameters expected by a
method. For instance if a method expects one array of structs as a parameter,
and it returns a string, its signature is simply “string, array”. If it
expects three integers and returns a string, its signature is “string, int,
int, int”.

If no signature is defined for the method, a non-array value is returned. In
Python this means that the type of the returned value will be something other
than list.

`ServerProxy.system.methodHelp(name)`

    
This method takes one parameter, the name of a method implemented by the XML-
RPC server. It returns a documentation string describing the use of that
method. If no such string is available, an empty string is returned. The
documentation string may contain HTML markup.

Changed in version 3.5: Instances of `ServerProxy` support the context manager
protocol for closing the underlying transport.

A working example follows. The server code:

    
    from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer
    
    def is_even(n):
        return n % 2 == 0
    
    server = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000))
    print("Listening on port 8000...")
    server.register_function(is_even, "is_even")
    server.serve_forever()
    
The client code for the preceding server:

    
    import xmlrpc.client
    
    with xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy("http://localhost:8000/") as proxy:
        print("3 is even: %s" % str(proxy.is_even(3)))
        print("100 is even: %s" % str(proxy.is_even(100)))
    
## DateTime Objects

`class xmlrpc.client.DateTime`

    
This class may be initialized with seconds since the epoch, a time tuple, an
ISO 8601 time/date string, or a `datetime.datetime` instance. It has the
following methods, supported mainly for internal use by the
marshalling/unmarshalling code:

`decode(string)`

    
Accept a string as the instance’s new time value.

`encode(out)`

    
Write the XML-RPC encoding of this `DateTime` item to the out stream object.

It also supports certain of Python’s built-in operators through rich
comparison and `__repr__()` methods.

A working example follows. The server code:

    
    import datetime
    from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer
    import xmlrpc.client
    
    def today():
        today = datetime.datetime.today()
        return xmlrpc.client.DateTime(today)
    
    server = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000))
    print("Listening on port 8000...")
    server.register_function(today, "today")
    server.serve_forever()
    
The client code for the preceding server:

    
    import xmlrpc.client
    import datetime
    
    proxy = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy("http://localhost:8000/")
    
    today = proxy.today()
    # convert the ISO8601 string to a datetime object
    converted = datetime.datetime.strptime(today.value, "%Y%m%dT%H:%M:%S")
    print("Today: %s" % converted.strftime("%d.%m.%Y, %H:%M"))
    
## Binary Objects

`class xmlrpc.client.Binary`

    
This class may be initialized from bytes data (which may include NULs). The
primary access to the content of a `Binary` object is provided by an
attribute:

`data`

    
The binary data encapsulated by the `Binary` instance. The data is provided as
a `bytes` object.

`Binary` objects have the following methods, supported mainly for internal use
by the marshalling/unmarshalling code:

`decode(bytes)`

    
Accept a base64 `bytes` object and decode it as the instance’s new data.

`encode(out)`

    
Write the XML-RPC base 64 encoding of this binary item to the out stream
object.

The encoded data will have newlines every 76 characters as per RFC 2045
section 6.8, which was the de facto standard base64 specification when the
XML-RPC spec was written.

It also supports certain of Python’s built-in operators through `__eq__()` and
`__ne__()` methods.

Example usage of the binary objects. We’re going to transfer an image over
XMLRPC:

    
    from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer
    import xmlrpc.client
    
    def python_logo():
        with open("python_logo.jpg", "rb") as handle:
            return xmlrpc.client.Binary(handle.read())
    
    server = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000))
    print("Listening on port 8000...")
    server.register_function(python_logo, 'python_logo')
    
    server.serve_forever()
    
The client gets the image and saves it to a file:

    
    import xmlrpc.client
    
    proxy = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy("http://localhost:8000/")
    with open("fetched_python_logo.jpg", "wb") as handle:
        handle.write(proxy.python_logo().data)
    
## Fault Objects

`class xmlrpc.client.Fault`

    
A `Fault` object encapsulates the content of an XML-RPC fault tag. Fault
objects have the following attributes:

`faultCode`

    
A string indicating the fault type.

`faultString`

    
A string containing a diagnostic message associated with the fault.

In the following example we’re going to intentionally cause a `Fault` by
returning a complex type object. The server code:

    
    from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer
    
    # A marshalling error is going to occur because we're returning a
    # complex number
    def add(x, y):
        return x+y+0j
    
    server = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000))
    print("Listening on port 8000...")
    server.register_function(add, 'add')
    
    server.serve_forever()
    
The client code for the preceding server:

    
    import xmlrpc.client
    
    proxy = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy("http://localhost:8000/")
    try:
        proxy.add(2, 5)
    except xmlrpc.client.Fault as err:
        print("A fault occurred")
        print("Fault code: %d" % err.faultCode)
        print("Fault string: %s" % err.faultString)
    
## ProtocolError Objects

`class xmlrpc.client.ProtocolError`

    
A `ProtocolError` object describes a protocol error in the underlying
transport layer (such as a 404 ‘not found’ error if the server named by the
URI does not exist). It has the following attributes:

`url`

    
The URI or URL that triggered the error.

`errcode`

    
The error code.

`errmsg`

    
The error message or diagnostic string.

`headers`

    
A dict containing the headers of the HTTP/HTTPS request that triggered the
error.

In the following example we’re going to intentionally cause a `ProtocolError`
by providing an invalid URI:

    
    import xmlrpc.client
    
    # create a ServerProxy with a URI that doesn't respond to XMLRPC requests
    proxy = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy("http://google.com/")
    
    try:
        proxy.some_method()
    except xmlrpc.client.ProtocolError as err:
        print("A protocol error occurred")
        print("URL: %s" % err.url)
        print("HTTP/HTTPS headers: %s" % err.headers)
        print("Error code: %d" % err.errcode)
        print("Error message: %s" % err.errmsg)
    
## MultiCall Objects

The `MultiCall` object provides a way to encapsulate multiple calls to a
remote server into a single request 1.

`class xmlrpc.client.MultiCall(server)`

    
Create an object used to boxcar method calls. server is the eventual target of
the call. Calls can be made to the result object, but they will immediately
return `None`, and only store the call name and parameters in the `MultiCall`
object. Calling the object itself causes all stored calls to be transmitted as
a single `system.multicall` request. The result of this call is a generator;
iterating over this generator yields the individual results.

A usage example of this class follows. The server code:

    
    from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer
    
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y
    
    def subtract(x, y):
        return x - y
    
    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y
    
    def divide(x, y):
        return x // y
    
    # A simple server with simple arithmetic functions
    server = SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000))
    print("Listening on port 8000...")
    server.register_multicall_functions()
    server.register_function(add, 'add')
    server.register_function(subtract, 'subtract')
    server.register_function(multiply, 'multiply')
    server.register_function(divide, 'divide')
    server.serve_forever()
    
The client code for the preceding server:

    
    import xmlrpc.client
    
    proxy = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy("http://localhost:8000/")
    multicall = xmlrpc.client.MultiCall(proxy)
    multicall.add(7, 3)
    multicall.subtract(7, 3)
    multicall.multiply(7, 3)
    multicall.divide(7, 3)
    result = multicall()
    
    print("7+3=%d, 7-3=%d, 7*3=%d, 7//3=%d" % tuple(result))
    
## Convenience Functions

`xmlrpc.client.dumps(params, methodname=None, methodresponse=None,
encoding=None, allow_none=False)`

    
Convert params into an XML-RPC request. or into a response if methodresponse
is true. params can be either a tuple of arguments or an instance of the
`Fault` exception class. If methodresponse is true, only a single value can be
returned, meaning that params must be of length 1. encoding, if supplied, is
the encoding to use in the generated XML; the default is UTF-8. Python’s
`None` value cannot be used in standard XML-RPC; to allow using it via an
extension, provide a true value for allow_none.

`xmlrpc.client.loads(data, use_datetime=False, use_builtin_types=False)`

    
Convert an XML-RPC request or response into Python objects, a `(params,
methodname)`. params is a tuple of argument; methodname is a string, or `None`
if no method name is present in the packet. If the XML-RPC packet represents a
fault condition, this function will raise a `Fault` exception. The
use_builtin_types flag can be used to cause date/time values to be presented
as `datetime.datetime` objects and binary data to be presented as `bytes`
objects; this flag is false by default.

The obsolete use_datetime flag is similar to use_builtin_types but it applies
only to date/time values.

Changed in version 3.3: The use_builtin_types flag was added.

## Example of Client Usage

    
    # simple test program (from the XML-RPC specification)
    from xmlrpc.client import ServerProxy, Error
    
    # server = ServerProxy("http://localhost:8000") # local server
    with ServerProxy("http://betty.userland.com") as proxy:
    
        print(proxy)
    
        try:
            print(proxy.examples.getStateName(41))
        except Error as v:
            print("ERROR", v)
    
To access an XML-RPC server through a HTTP proxy, you need to define a custom
transport. The following example shows how:

    
    import http.client
    import xmlrpc.client
    
    class ProxiedTransport(xmlrpc.client.Transport):
    
        def set_proxy(self, host, port=None, headers=None):
            self.proxy = host, port
            self.proxy_headers = headers
    
        def make_connection(self, host):
            connection = http.client.HTTPConnection(*self.proxy)
            connection.set_tunnel(host, headers=self.proxy_headers)
            self._connection = host, connection
            return connection
    
    transport = ProxiedTransport()
    transport.set_proxy('proxy-server', 8080)
    server = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy('http://betty.userland.com', transport=transport)
    print(server.examples.getStateName(41))
