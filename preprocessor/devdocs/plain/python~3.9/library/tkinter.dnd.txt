# tkinter.dnd — Drag and drop support

Source code: Lib/tkinter/dnd.py

Note

This is experimental and due to be deprecated when it is replaced with the Tk
DND.

The `tkinter.dnd` module provides drag-and-drop support for objects within a
single application, within the same window or between windows. To enable an
object to be dragged, you must create an event binding for it that starts the
drag-and-drop process. Typically, you bind a ButtonPress event to a callback
function that you write (see Bindings and Events). The function should call
`dnd_start()`, where ‘source’ is the object to be dragged, and ‘event’ is the
event that invoked the call (the argument to your callback function).

Selection of a target object occurs as follows:

  1. Top-down search of area under mouse for target widget

  * Target widget should have a callable dnd_accept attribute
  * If dnd_accept is not present or returns None, search moves to parent widget
  * If no target widget is found, then the target object is None

  2. Call to <old_target>.dnd_leave(source, event)
  3. Call to <new_target>.dnd_enter(source, event)
  4. Call to <target>.dnd_commit(source, event) to notify of drop
  5. Call to <source>.dnd_end(target, event) to signal end of drag-and-drop

`class tkinter.dnd.DndHandler(source, event)`

    
The DndHandler class handles drag-and-drop events tracking Motion and
ButtonRelease events on the root of the event widget.

`cancel(event=None)`

    
Cancel the drag-and-drop process.

`finish(event, commit=0)`

    
Execute end of drag-and-drop functions.

`on_motion(event)`

    
Inspect area below mouse for target objects while drag is performed.

`on_release(event)`

    
Signal end of drag when the release pattern is triggered.

`tkinter.dnd.dnd_start(source, event)`

    
Factory function for drag-and-drop process.
