# multiprocessing — Process-based parallelism

Source code: Lib/multiprocessing/

## Introduction

`multiprocessing` is a package that supports spawning processes using an API
similar to the `threading` module. The `multiprocessing` package offers both
local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter
Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. Due to this, the
`multiprocessing` module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple
processors on a given machine. It runs on both Unix and Windows.

The `multiprocessing` module also introduces APIs which do not have analogs in
the `threading` module. A prime example of this is the `Pool` object which
offers a convenient means of parallelizing the execution of a function across
multiple input values, distributing the input data across processes (data
parallelism). The following example demonstrates the common practice of
defining such functions in a module so that child processes can successfully
import that module. This basic example of data parallelism using `Pool`,

    
    from multiprocessing import Pool
    
    def f(x):
        return x*x
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with Pool(5) as p:
            print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]))
    
will print to standard output

    
    [1, 4, 9]
    
### The `Process` class

In `multiprocessing`, processes are spawned by creating a `Process` object and
then calling its `start()` method. `Process` follows the API of
`threading.Thread`. A trivial example of a multiprocess program is

    
    from multiprocessing import Process
    
    def f(name):
        print('hello', name)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        p = Process(target=f, args=('bob',))
        p.start()
        p.join()
    
To show the individual process IDs involved, here is an expanded example:

    
    from multiprocessing import Process
    import os
    
    def info(title):
        print(title)
        print('module name:', __name__)
        print('parent process:', os.getppid())
        print('process id:', os.getpid())
    
    def f(name):
        info('function f')
        print('hello', name)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        info('main line')
        p = Process(target=f, args=('bob',))
        p.start()
        p.join()
    
For an explanation of why the `if __name__ == '__main__'` part is necessary,
see Programming guidelines.

### Contexts and start methods

Depending on the platform, `multiprocessing` supports three ways to start a
process. These start methods are

spawn

    
The parent process starts a fresh python interpreter process. The child
process will only inherit those resources necessary to run the process
object’s `run()` method. In particular, unnecessary file descriptors and
handles from the parent process will not be inherited. Starting a process
using this method is rather slow compared to using fork or forkserver.

Available on Unix and Windows. The default on Windows and macOS.

fork

    
The parent process uses `os.fork()` to fork the Python interpreter. The child
process, when it begins, is effectively identical to the parent process. All
resources of the parent are inherited by the child process. Note that safely
forking a multithreaded process is problematic.

Available on Unix only. The default on Unix.

forkserver

    
When the program starts and selects the forkserver start method, a server
process is started. From then on, whenever a new process is needed, the parent
process connects to the server and requests that it fork a new process. The
fork server process is single threaded so it is safe for it to use
`os.fork()`. No unnecessary resources are inherited.

Available on Unix platforms which support passing file descriptors over Unix
pipes.

Changed in version 3.8: On macOS, the spawn start method is now the default.
The fork start method should be considered unsafe as it can lead to crashes of
the subprocess. See bpo-33725.

Changed in version 3.4: spawn added on all unix platforms, and forkserver
added for some unix platforms. Child processes no longer inherit all of the
parents inheritable handles on Windows.

On Unix using the spawn or forkserver start methods will also start a resource
tracker process which tracks the unlinked named system resources (such as
named semaphores or `SharedMemory` objects) created by processes of the
program. When all processes have exited the resource tracker unlinks any
remaining tracked object. Usually there should be none, but if a process was
killed by a signal there may be some “leaked” resources. (Neither leaked
semaphores nor shared memory segments will be automatically unlinked until the
next reboot. This is problematic for both objects because the system allows
only a limited number of named semaphores, and shared memory segments occupy
some space in the main memory.)

To select a start method you use the `set_start_method()` in the `if __name__
== '__main__'` clause of the main module. For example:

    
    import multiprocessing as mp
    
    def foo(q):
        q.put('hello')
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        mp.set_start_method('spawn')
        q = mp.Queue()
        p = mp.Process(target=foo, args=(q,))
        p.start()
        print(q.get())
        p.join()
    
`set_start_method()` should not be used more than once in the program.

Alternatively, you can use `get_context()` to obtain a context object. Context
objects have the same API as the multiprocessing module, and allow one to use
multiple start methods in the same program.

    
    import multiprocessing as mp
    
    def foo(q):
        q.put('hello')
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        ctx = mp.get_context('spawn')
        q = ctx.Queue()
        p = ctx.Process(target=foo, args=(q,))
        p.start()
        print(q.get())
        p.join()
    
Note that objects related to one context may not be compatible with processes
for a different context. In particular, locks created using the fork context
cannot be passed to processes started using the spawn or forkserver start
methods.

A library which wants to use a particular start method should probably use
`get_context()` to avoid interfering with the choice of the library user.

Warning

The `'spawn'` and `'forkserver'` start methods cannot currently be used with
“frozen” executables (i.e., binaries produced by packages like PyInstaller and
cx_Freeze) on Unix. The `'fork'` start method does work.

### Exchanging objects between processes

`multiprocessing` supports two types of communication channel between
processes:

Queues

The `Queue` class is a near clone of `queue.Queue`. For example:

    
    from multiprocessing import Process, Queue
    
    def f(q):
        q.put([42, None, 'hello'])
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        q = Queue()
        p = Process(target=f, args=(q,))
        p.start()
        print(q.get())    # prints "[42, None, 'hello']"
        p.join()
    
Queues are thread and process safe.

Pipes

The `Pipe()` function returns a pair of connection objects connected by a pipe
which by default is duplex (two-way). For example:

    
    from multiprocessing import Process, Pipe
    
    def f(conn):
        conn.send([42, None, 'hello'])
        conn.close()
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        parent_conn, child_conn = Pipe()
        p = Process(target=f, args=(child_conn,))
        p.start()
        print(parent_conn.recv())   # prints "[42, None, 'hello']"
        p.join()
    
The two connection objects returned by `Pipe()` represent the two ends of the
pipe. Each connection object has `send()` and `recv()` methods (among others).
Note that data in a pipe may become corrupted if two processes (or threads)
try to read from or write to the same end of the pipe at the same time. Of
course there is no risk of corruption from processes using different ends of
the pipe at the same time.

### Synchronization between processes

`multiprocessing` contains equivalents of all the synchronization primitives
from `threading`. For instance one can use a lock to ensure that only one
process prints to standard output at a time:

    
    from multiprocessing import Process, Lock
    
    def f(l, i):
        l.acquire()
        try:
            print('hello world', i)
        finally:
            l.release()
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        lock = Lock()
    
        for num in range(10):
            Process(target=f, args=(lock, num)).start()
    
Without using the lock output from the different processes is liable to get
all mixed up.

### Sharing state between processes

As mentioned above, when doing concurrent programming it is usually best to
avoid using shared state as far as possible. This is particularly true when
using multiple processes.

However, if you really do need to use some shared data then `multiprocessing`
provides a couple of ways of doing so.

Shared memory

Data can be stored in a shared memory map using `Value` or `Array`. For
example, the following code

    
    from multiprocessing import Process, Value, Array
    
    def f(n, a):
        n.value = 3.1415927
        for i in range(len(a)):
            a[i] = -a[i]
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        num = Value('d', 0.0)
        arr = Array('i', range(10))
    
        p = Process(target=f, args=(num, arr))
        p.start()
        p.join()
    
        print(num.value)
        print(arr[:])
    
will print

    
    3.1415927
    [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]
    
The `'d'` and `'i'` arguments used when creating `num` and `arr` are typecodes
of the kind used by the `array` module: `'d'` indicates a double precision
float and `'i'` indicates a signed integer. These shared objects will be
process and thread-safe.

For more flexibility in using shared memory one can use the
`multiprocessing.sharedctypes` module which supports the creation of arbitrary
ctypes objects allocated from shared memory.

Server process

A manager object returned by `Manager()` controls a server process which holds
Python objects and allows other processes to manipulate them using proxies.

A manager returned by `Manager()` will support types `list`, `dict`,
`Namespace`, `Lock`, `RLock`, `Semaphore`, `BoundedSemaphore`, `Condition`,
`Event`, `Barrier`, `Queue`, `Value` and `Array`. For example,

    
    from multiprocessing import Process, Manager
    
    def f(d, l):
        d[1] = '1'
        d['2'] = 2
        d[0.25] = None
        l.reverse()
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with Manager() as manager:
            d = manager.dict()
            l = manager.list(range(10))
    
            p = Process(target=f, args=(d, l))
            p.start()
            p.join()
    
            print(d)
            print(l)
    
will print

    
    {0.25: None, 1: '1', '2': 2}
    [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
    
Server process managers are more flexible than using shared memory objects
because they can be made to support arbitrary object types. Also, a single
manager can be shared by processes on different computers over a network. They
are, however, slower than using shared memory.

### Using a pool of workers

The `Pool` class represents a pool of worker processes. It has methods which
allows tasks to be offloaded to the worker processes in a few different ways.

For example:

    
    from multiprocessing import Pool, TimeoutError
    import time
    import os
    
    def f(x):
        return x*x
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # start 4 worker processes
        with Pool(processes=4) as pool:
    
            # print "[0, 1, 4,..., 81]"
            print(pool.map(f, range(10)))
    
            # print same numbers in arbitrary order
            for i in pool.imap_unordered(f, range(10)):
                print(i)
    
            # evaluate "f(20)" asynchronously
            res = pool.apply_async(f, (20,))      # runs in *only* one process
            print(res.get(timeout=1))             # prints "400"
    
            # evaluate "os.getpid()" asynchronously
            res = pool.apply_async(os.getpid, ()) # runs in *only* one process
            print(res.get(timeout=1))             # prints the PID of that process
    
            # launching multiple evaluations asynchronously *may* use more processes
            multiple_results = [pool.apply_async(os.getpid, ()) for i in range(4)]
            print([res.get(timeout=1) for res in multiple_results])
    
            # make a single worker sleep for 10 secs
            res = pool.apply_async(time.sleep, (10,))
            try:
                print(res.get(timeout=1))
            except TimeoutError:
                print("We lacked patience and got a multiprocessing.TimeoutError")
    
            print("For the moment, the pool remains available for more work")
    
        # exiting the 'with'-block has stopped the pool
        print("Now the pool is closed and no longer available")
    
Note that the methods of a pool should only ever be used by the process which
created it.

Note

Functionality within this package requires that the `__main__` module be
importable by the children. This is covered in Programming guidelines however
it is worth pointing out here. This means that some examples, such as the
`multiprocessing.pool.Pool` examples will not work in the interactive
interpreter. For example:

    
    >>> from multiprocessing import Pool
    >>> p = Pool(5)
    >>> def f(x):
    ...     return x*x
    ...
    >>> with p:
    ...   p.map(f, [1,2,3])
    Process PoolWorker-1:
    Process PoolWorker-2:
    Process PoolWorker-3:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'f'
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'f'
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'f'
    
(If you try this it will actually output three full tracebacks interleaved in
a semi-random fashion, and then you may have to stop the parent process
somehow.)

## Reference

The `multiprocessing` package mostly replicates the API of the `threading`
module.

###  `Process` and exceptions

`class multiprocessing.Process(group=None, target=None, name=None, args=(),
kwargs={}, *, daemon=None)`

    
Process objects represent activity that is run in a separate process. The
`Process` class has equivalents of all the methods of `threading.Thread`.

The constructor should always be called with keyword arguments. group should
always be `None`; it exists solely for compatibility with `threading.Thread`.
target is the callable object to be invoked by the `run()` method. It defaults
to `None`, meaning nothing is called. name is the process name (see `name` for
more details). args is the argument tuple for the target invocation. kwargs is
a dictionary of keyword arguments for the target invocation. If provided, the
keyword-only daemon argument sets the process `daemon` flag to `True` or
`False`. If `None` (the default), this flag will be inherited from the
creating process.

By default, no arguments are passed to target.

If a subclass overrides the constructor, it must make sure it invokes the base
class constructor (`Process.__init__()`) before doing anything else to the
process.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the daemon argument.

`run()`

    
Method representing the process’s activity.

You may override this method in a subclass. The standard `run()` method
invokes the callable object passed to the object’s constructor as the target
argument, if any, with sequential and keyword arguments taken from the args
and kwargs arguments, respectively.

`start()`

    
Start the process’s activity.

This must be called at most once per process object. It arranges for the
object’s `run()` method to be invoked in a separate process.

`join([timeout])`

    
If the optional argument timeout is `None` (the default), the method blocks
until the process whose `join()` method is called terminates. If timeout is a
positive number, it blocks at most timeout seconds. Note that the method
returns `None` if its process terminates or if the method times out. Check the
process’s `exitcode` to determine if it terminated.

A process can be joined many times.

A process cannot join itself because this would cause a deadlock. It is an
error to attempt to join a process before it has been started.

`name`

    
The process’s name. The name is a string used for identification purposes
only. It has no semantics. Multiple processes may be given the same name.

The initial name is set by the constructor. If no explicit name is provided to
the constructor, a name of the form ‘Process-N1:N2:…:Nk’ is constructed, where
each Nk is the N-th child of its parent.

`is_alive()`

    
Return whether the process is alive.

Roughly, a process object is alive from the moment the `start()` method
returns until the child process terminates.

`daemon`

    
The process’s daemon flag, a Boolean value. This must be set before `start()`
is called.

The initial value is inherited from the creating process.

When a process exits, it attempts to terminate all of its daemonic child
processes.

Note that a daemonic process is not allowed to create child processes.
Otherwise a daemonic process would leave its children orphaned if it gets
terminated when its parent process exits. Additionally, these are not Unix
daemons or services, they are normal processes that will be terminated (and
not joined) if non-daemonic processes have exited.

In addition to the `threading.Thread` API, `Process` objects also support the
following attributes and methods:

`pid`

    
Return the process ID. Before the process is spawned, this will be `None`.

`exitcode`

    
The child’s exit code. This will be `None` if the process has not yet
terminated. A negative value -N indicates that the child was terminated by
signal N.

`authkey`

    
The process’s authentication key (a byte string).

When `multiprocessing` is initialized the main process is assigned a random
string using `os.urandom()`.

When a `Process` object is created, it will inherit the authentication key of
its parent process, although this may be changed by setting `authkey` to
another byte string.

See Authentication keys.

`sentinel`

    
A numeric handle of a system object which will become “ready” when the process
ends.

You can use this value if you want to wait on several events at once using
`multiprocessing.connection.wait()`. Otherwise calling `join()` is simpler.

On Windows, this is an OS handle usable with the `WaitForSingleObject` and
`WaitForMultipleObjects` family of API calls. On Unix, this is a file
descriptor usable with primitives from the `select` module.

New in version 3.3.

`terminate()`

    
Terminate the process. On Unix this is done using the `SIGTERM` signal; on
Windows `TerminateProcess()` is used. Note that exit handlers and finally
clauses, etc., will not be executed.

Note that descendant processes of the process will not be terminated – they
will simply become orphaned.

Warning

If this method is used when the associated process is using a pipe or queue
then the pipe or queue is liable to become corrupted and may become unusable
by other process. Similarly, if the process has acquired a lock or semaphore
etc. then terminating it is liable to cause other processes to deadlock.

`kill()`

    
Same as `terminate()` but using the `SIGKILL` signal on Unix.

New in version 3.7.

`close()`

    
Close the `Process` object, releasing all resources associated with it.
`ValueError` is raised if the underlying process is still running. Once
`close()` returns successfully, most other methods and attributes of the
`Process` object will raise `ValueError`.

New in version 3.7.

Note that the `start()`, `join()`, `is_alive()`, `terminate()` and `exitcode`
methods should only be called by the process that created the process object.

Example usage of some of the methods of `Process`:

    
     >>> import multiprocessing, time, signal
     >>> p = multiprocessing.Process(target=time.sleep, args=(1000,))
     >>> print(p, p.is_alive())
     <Process ... initial> False
     >>> p.start()
     >>> print(p, p.is_alive())
     <Process ... started> True
     >>> p.terminate()
     >>> time.sleep(0.1)
     >>> print(p, p.is_alive())
     <Process ... stopped exitcode=-SIGTERM> False
     >>> p.exitcode == -signal.SIGTERM
     True
    
`exception multiprocessing.ProcessError`

    
The base class of all `multiprocessing` exceptions.

`exception multiprocessing.BufferTooShort`

    
Exception raised by `Connection.recv_bytes_into()` when the supplied buffer
object is too small for the message read.

If `e` is an instance of `BufferTooShort` then `e.args[0]` will give the
message as a byte string.

`exception multiprocessing.AuthenticationError`

    
Raised when there is an authentication error.

`exception multiprocessing.TimeoutError`

    
Raised by methods with a timeout when the timeout expires.

### Pipes and Queues

When using multiple processes, one generally uses message passing for
communication between processes and avoids having to use any synchronization
primitives like locks.

For passing messages one can use `Pipe()` (for a connection between two
processes) or a queue (which allows multiple producers and consumers).

The `Queue`, `SimpleQueue` and `JoinableQueue` types are multi-producer,
multi-consumer FIFO queues modelled on the `queue.Queue` class in the standard
library. They differ in that `Queue` lacks the `task_done()` and `join()`
methods introduced into Python 2.5’s `queue.Queue` class.

If you use `JoinableQueue` then you must call `JoinableQueue.task_done()` for
each task removed from the queue or else the semaphore used to count the
number of unfinished tasks may eventually overflow, raising an exception.

Note that one can also create a shared queue by using a manager object – see
Managers.

Note

`multiprocessing` uses the usual `queue.Empty` and `queue.Full` exceptions to
signal a timeout. They are not available in the `multiprocessing` namespace so
you need to import them from `queue`.

Note

When an object is put on a queue, the object is pickled and a background
thread later flushes the pickled data to an underlying pipe. This has some
consequences which are a little surprising, but should not cause any practical
difficulties – if they really bother you then you can instead use a queue
created with a manager.

  1. After putting an object on an empty queue there may be an infinitesimal delay before the queue’s `empty()` method returns `False` and `get_nowait()` can return without raising `queue.Empty`.
  2. If multiple processes are enqueuing objects, it is possible for the objects to be received at the other end out-of-order. However, objects enqueued by the same process will always be in the expected order with respect to each other.

Warning

If a process is killed using `Process.terminate()` or `os.kill()` while it is
trying to use a `Queue`, then the data in the queue is likely to become
corrupted. This may cause any other process to get an exception when it tries
to use the queue later on.

Warning

As mentioned above, if a child process has put items on a queue (and it has
not used `JoinableQueue.cancel_join_thread`), then that process will not
terminate until all buffered items have been flushed to the pipe.

This means that if you try joining that process you may get a deadlock unless
you are sure that all items which have been put on the queue have been
consumed. Similarly, if the child process is non-daemonic then the parent
process may hang on exit when it tries to join all its non-daemonic children.

Note that a queue created using a manager does not have this issue. See
Programming guidelines.

For an example of the usage of queues for interprocess communication see
Examples.

`multiprocessing.Pipe([duplex])`

    
Returns a pair `(conn1, conn2)` of `Connection` objects representing the ends
of a pipe.

If duplex is `True` (the default) then the pipe is bidirectional. If duplex is
`False` then the pipe is unidirectional: `conn1` can only be used for
receiving messages and `conn2` can only be used for sending messages.

`class multiprocessing.Queue([maxsize])`

    
Returns a process shared queue implemented using a pipe and a few
locks/semaphores. When a process first puts an item on the queue a feeder
thread is started which transfers objects from a buffer into the pipe.

The usual `queue.Empty` and `queue.Full` exceptions from the standard
library’s `queue` module are raised to signal timeouts.

`Queue` implements all the methods of `queue.Queue` except for `task_done()`
and `join()`.

`qsize()`

    
Return the approximate size of the queue. Because of
multithreading/multiprocessing semantics, this number is not reliable.

Note that this may raise `NotImplementedError` on Unix platforms like Mac OS X
where `sem_getvalue()` is not implemented.

`empty()`

    
Return `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise. Because of
multithreading/multiprocessing semantics, this is not reliable.

`full()`

    
Return `True` if the queue is full, `False` otherwise. Because of
multithreading/multiprocessing semantics, this is not reliable.

`put(obj[, block[, timeout]])`

    
Put obj into the queue. If the optional argument block is `True` (the default)
and timeout is `None` (the default), block if necessary until a free slot is
available. If timeout is a positive number, it blocks at most timeout seconds
and raises the `queue.Full` exception if no free slot was available within
that time. Otherwise (block is `False`), put an item on the queue if a free
slot is immediately available, else raise the `queue.Full` exception (timeout
is ignored in that case).

Changed in version 3.8: If the queue is closed, `ValueError` is raised instead
of `AssertionError`.

`put_nowait(obj)`

    
Equivalent to `put(obj, False)`.

`get([block[, timeout]])`

    
Remove and return an item from the queue. If optional args block is `True`
(the default) and timeout is `None` (the default), block if necessary until an
item is available. If timeout is a positive number, it blocks at most timeout
seconds and raises the `queue.Empty` exception if no item was available within
that time. Otherwise (block is `False`), return an item if one is immediately
available, else raise the `queue.Empty` exception (timeout is ignored in that
case).

Changed in version 3.8: If the queue is closed, `ValueError` is raised instead
of `OSError`.

`get_nowait()`

    
Equivalent to `get(False)`.

`multiprocessing.Queue` has a few additional methods not found in
`queue.Queue`. These methods are usually unnecessary for most code:

`close()`

    
Indicate that no more data will be put on this queue by the current process.
The background thread will quit once it has flushed all buffered data to the
pipe. This is called automatically when the queue is garbage collected.

`join_thread()`

    
Join the background thread. This can only be used after `close()` has been
called. It blocks until the background thread exits, ensuring that all data in
the buffer has been flushed to the pipe.

By default if a process is not the creator of the queue then on exit it will
attempt to join the queue’s background thread. The process can call
`cancel_join_thread()` to make `join_thread()` do nothing.

`cancel_join_thread()`

    
Prevent `join_thread()` from blocking. In particular, this prevents the
background thread from being joined automatically when the process exits – see
`join_thread()`.

A better name for this method might be `allow_exit_without_flush()`. It is
likely to cause enqueued data to lost, and you almost certainly will not need
to use it. It is really only there if you need the current process to exit
immediately without waiting to flush enqueued data to the underlying pipe, and
you don’t care about lost data.

Note

This class’s functionality requires a functioning shared semaphore
implementation on the host operating system. Without one, the functionality in
this class will be disabled, and attempts to instantiate a `Queue` will result
in an `ImportError`. See bpo-3770 for additional information. The same holds
true for any of the specialized queue types listed below.

`class multiprocessing.SimpleQueue`

    
It is a simplified `Queue` type, very close to a locked `Pipe`.

`close()`

    
Close the queue: release internal resources.

A queue must not be used anymore after it is closed. For example, `get()`,
`put()` and `empty()` methods must no longer be called.

New in version 3.9.

`empty()`

    
Return `True` if the queue is empty, `False` otherwise.

`get()`

    
Remove and return an item from the queue.

`put(item)`

    
Put item into the queue.

`class multiprocessing.JoinableQueue([maxsize])`

    
`JoinableQueue`, a `Queue` subclass, is a queue which additionally has
`task_done()` and `join()` methods.

`task_done()`

    
Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete. Used by queue consumers.
For each `get()` used to fetch a task, a subsequent call to `task_done()`
tells the queue that the processing on the task is complete.

If a `join()` is currently blocking, it will resume when all items have been
processed (meaning that a `task_done()` call was received for every item that
had been `put()` into the queue).

Raises a `ValueError` if called more times than there were items placed in the
queue.

`join()`

    
Block until all items in the queue have been gotten and processed.

The count of unfinished tasks goes up whenever an item is added to the queue.
The count goes down whenever a consumer calls `task_done()` to indicate that
the item was retrieved and all work on it is complete. When the count of
unfinished tasks drops to zero, `join()` unblocks.

### Miscellaneous

`multiprocessing.active_children()`

    
Return list of all live children of the current process.

Calling this has the side effect of “joining” any processes which have already
finished.

`multiprocessing.cpu_count()`

    
Return the number of CPUs in the system.

This number is not equivalent to the number of CPUs the current process can
use. The number of usable CPUs can be obtained with
`len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))`

May raise `NotImplementedError`.

See also

`os.cpu_count()`

`multiprocessing.current_process()`

    
Return the `Process` object corresponding to the current process.

An analogue of `threading.current_thread()`.

`multiprocessing.parent_process()`

    
Return the `Process` object corresponding to the parent process of the
`current_process()`. For the main process, `parent_process` will be `None`.

New in version 3.8.

`multiprocessing.freeze_support()`

    
Add support for when a program which uses `multiprocessing` has been frozen to
produce a Windows executable. (Has been tested with py2exe, PyInstaller and
cx_Freeze.)

One needs to call this function straight after the `if __name__ == '__main__'`
line of the main module. For example:

    
    from multiprocessing import Process, freeze_support
    
    def f():
        print('hello world!')
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        freeze_support()
        Process(target=f).start()
    
If the `freeze_support()` line is omitted then trying to run the frozen
executable will raise `RuntimeError`.

Calling `freeze_support()` has no effect when invoked on any operating system
other than Windows. In addition, if the module is being run normally by the
Python interpreter on Windows (the program has not been frozen), then
`freeze_support()` has no effect.

`multiprocessing.get_all_start_methods()`

    
Returns a list of the supported start methods, the first of which is the
default. The possible start methods are `'fork'`, `'spawn'` and
`'forkserver'`. On Windows only `'spawn'` is available. On Unix `'fork'` and
`'spawn'` are always supported, with `'fork'` being the default.

New in version 3.4.

`multiprocessing.get_context(method=None)`

    
Return a context object which has the same attributes as the `multiprocessing`
module.

If method is `None` then the default context is returned. Otherwise method
should be `'fork'`, `'spawn'`, `'forkserver'`. `ValueError` is raised if the
specified start method is not available.

New in version 3.4.

`multiprocessing.get_start_method(allow_none=False)`

    
Return the name of start method used for starting processes.

If the start method has not been fixed and allow_none is false, then the start
method is fixed to the default and the name is returned. If the start method
has not been fixed and allow_none is true then `None` is returned.

The return value can be `'fork'`, `'spawn'`, `'forkserver'` or `None`.
`'fork'` is the default on Unix, while `'spawn'` is the default on Windows.

New in version 3.4.

`multiprocessing.set_executable()`

    
Sets the path of the Python interpreter to use when starting a child process.
(By default `sys.executable` is used). Embedders will probably need to do some
thing like

    
    set_executable(os.path.join(sys.exec_prefix, 'pythonw.exe'))
    
before they can create child processes.

Changed in version 3.4: Now supported on Unix when the `'spawn'` start method
is used.

`multiprocessing.set_start_method(method)`

    
Set the method which should be used to start child processes. method can be
`'fork'`, `'spawn'` or `'forkserver'`.

Note that this should be called at most once, and it should be protected
inside the `if __name__ == '__main__'` clause of the main module.

New in version 3.4.

Note

`multiprocessing` contains no analogues of `threading.active_count()`,
`threading.enumerate()`, `threading.settrace()`, `threading.setprofile()`,
`threading.Timer`, or `threading.local`.

### Connection Objects

Connection objects allow the sending and receiving of picklable objects or
strings. They can be thought of as message oriented connected sockets.

Connection objects are usually created using `Pipe` – see also Listeners and
Clients.

`class multiprocessing.connection.Connection`

    
`send(obj)`

    
Send an object to the other end of the connection which should be read using
`recv()`.

The object must be picklable. Very large pickles (approximately 32 MiB+,
though it depends on the OS) may raise a `ValueError` exception.

`recv()`

    
Return an object sent from the other end of the connection using `send()`.
Blocks until there is something to receive. Raises `EOFError` if there is
nothing left to receive and the other end was closed.

`fileno()`

    
Return the file descriptor or handle used by the connection.

`close()`

    
Close the connection.

This is called automatically when the connection is garbage collected.

`poll([timeout])`

    
Return whether there is any data available to be read.

If timeout is not specified then it will return immediately. If timeout is a
number then this specifies the maximum time in seconds to block. If timeout is
`None` then an infinite timeout is used.

Note that multiple connection objects may be polled at once by using
`multiprocessing.connection.wait()`.

`send_bytes(buffer[, offset[, size]])`

    
Send byte data from a bytes-like object as a complete message.

If offset is given then data is read from that position in buffer. If size is
given then that many bytes will be read from buffer. Very large buffers
(approximately 32 MiB+, though it depends on the OS) may raise a `ValueError`
exception

`recv_bytes([maxlength])`

    
Return a complete message of byte data sent from the other end of the
connection as a string. Blocks until there is something to receive. Raises
`EOFError` if there is nothing left to receive and the other end has closed.

If maxlength is specified and the message is longer than maxlength then
`OSError` is raised and the connection will no longer be readable.

Changed in version 3.3: This function used to raise `IOError`, which is now an
alias of `OSError`.

`recv_bytes_into(buffer[, offset])`

    
Read into buffer a complete message of byte data sent from the other end of
the connection and return the number of bytes in the message. Blocks until
there is something to receive. Raises `EOFError` if there is nothing left to
receive and the other end was closed.

buffer must be a writable bytes-like object. If offset is given then the
message will be written into the buffer from that position. Offset must be a
non-negative integer less than the length of buffer (in bytes).

If the buffer is too short then a `BufferTooShort` exception is raised and the
complete message is available as `e.args[0]` where `e` is the exception
instance.

Changed in version 3.3: Connection objects themselves can now be transferred
between processes using `Connection.send()` and `Connection.recv()`.

New in version 3.3: Connection objects now support the context management
protocol – see Context Manager Types. `__enter__()` returns the connection
object, and `__exit__()` calls `close()`.

For example:

    
    >>> from multiprocessing import Pipe
    >>> a, b = Pipe()
    >>> a.send([1, 'hello', None])
    >>> b.recv()
    [1, 'hello', None]
    >>> b.send_bytes(b'thank you')
    >>> a.recv_bytes()
    b'thank you'
    >>> import array
    >>> arr1 = array.array('i', range(5))
    >>> arr2 = array.array('i', [0] * 10)
    >>> a.send_bytes(arr1)
    >>> count = b.recv_bytes_into(arr2)
    >>> assert count == len(arr1) * arr1.itemsize
    >>> arr2
    array('i', [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
    
Warning

The `Connection.recv()` method automatically unpickles the data it receives,
which can be a security risk unless you can trust the process which sent the
message.

Therefore, unless the connection object was produced using `Pipe()` you should
only use the `recv()` and `send()` methods after performing some sort of
authentication. See Authentication keys.

Warning

If a process is killed while it is trying to read or write to a pipe then the
data in the pipe is likely to become corrupted, because it may become
impossible to be sure where the message boundaries lie.

### Synchronization primitives

Generally synchronization primitives are not as necessary in a multiprocess
program as they are in a multithreaded program. See the documentation for
`threading` module.

Note that one can also create synchronization primitives by using a manager
object – see Managers.

`class multiprocessing.Barrier(parties[, action[, timeout]])`

    
A barrier object: a clone of `threading.Barrier`.

New in version 3.3.

`class multiprocessing.BoundedSemaphore([value])`

    
A bounded semaphore object: a close analog of `threading.BoundedSemaphore`.

A solitary difference from its close analog exists: its `acquire` method’s
first argument is named block, as is consistent with `Lock.acquire()`.

Note

On Mac OS X, this is indistinguishable from `Semaphore` because
`sem_getvalue()` is not implemented on that platform.

`class multiprocessing.Condition([lock])`

    
A condition variable: an alias for `threading.Condition`.

If lock is specified then it should be a `Lock` or `RLock` object from
`multiprocessing`.

Changed in version 3.3: The `wait_for()` method was added.

`class multiprocessing.Event`

    
A clone of `threading.Event`.

`class multiprocessing.Lock`

    
A non-recursive lock object: a close analog of `threading.Lock`. Once a
process or thread has acquired a lock, subsequent attempts to acquire it from
any process or thread will block until it is released; any process or thread
may release it. The concepts and behaviors of `threading.Lock` as it applies
to threads are replicated here in `multiprocessing.Lock` as it applies to
either processes or threads, except as noted.

Note that `Lock` is actually a factory function which returns an instance of
`multiprocessing.synchronize.Lock` initialized with a default context.

`Lock` supports the context manager protocol and thus may be used in `with`
statements.

`acquire(block=True, timeout=None)`

    
Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.

With the block argument set to `True` (the default), the method call will
block until the lock is in an unlocked state, then set it to locked and return
`True`. Note that the name of this first argument differs from that in
`threading.Lock.acquire()`.

With the block argument set to `False`, the method call does not block. If the
lock is currently in a locked state, return `False`; otherwise set the lock to
a locked state and return `True`.

When invoked with a positive, floating-point value for timeout, block for at
most the number of seconds specified by timeout as long as the lock can not be
acquired. Invocations with a negative value for timeout are equivalent to a
timeout of zero. Invocations with a timeout value of `None` (the default) set
the timeout period to infinite. Note that the treatment of negative or `None`
values for timeout differs from the implemented behavior in
`threading.Lock.acquire()`. The timeout argument has no practical implications
if the block argument is set to `False` and is thus ignored. Returns `True` if
the lock has been acquired or `False` if the timeout period has elapsed.

`release()`

    
Release a lock. This can be called from any process or thread, not only the
process or thread which originally acquired the lock.

Behavior is the same as in `threading.Lock.release()` except that when invoked
on an unlocked lock, a `ValueError` is raised.

`class multiprocessing.RLock`

    
A recursive lock object: a close analog of `threading.RLock`. A recursive lock
must be released by the process or thread that acquired it. Once a process or
thread has acquired a recursive lock, the same process or thread may acquire
it again without blocking; that process or thread must release it once for
each time it has been acquired.

Note that `RLock` is actually a factory function which returns an instance of
`multiprocessing.synchronize.RLock` initialized with a default context.

`RLock` supports the context manager protocol and thus may be used in `with`
statements.

`acquire(block=True, timeout=None)`

    
Acquire a lock, blocking or non-blocking.

When invoked with the block argument set to `True`, block until the lock is in
an unlocked state (not owned by any process or thread) unless the lock is
already owned by the current process or thread. The current process or thread
then takes ownership of the lock (if it does not already have ownership) and
the recursion level inside the lock increments by one, resulting in a return
value of `True`. Note that there are several differences in this first
argument’s behavior compared to the implementation of
`threading.RLock.acquire()`, starting with the name of the argument itself.

When invoked with the block argument set to `False`, do not block. If the lock
has already been acquired (and thus is owned) by another process or thread,
the current process or thread does not take ownership and the recursion level
within the lock is not changed, resulting in a return value of `False`. If the
lock is in an unlocked state, the current process or thread takes ownership
and the recursion level is incremented, resulting in a return value of `True`.

Use and behaviors of the timeout argument are the same as in `Lock.acquire()`.
Note that some of these behaviors of timeout differ from the implemented
behaviors in `threading.RLock.acquire()`.

`release()`

    
Release a lock, decrementing the recursion level. If after the decrement the
recursion level is zero, reset the lock to unlocked (not owned by any process
or thread) and if any other processes or threads are blocked waiting for the
lock to become unlocked, allow exactly one of them to proceed. If after the
decrement the recursion level is still nonzero, the lock remains locked and
owned by the calling process or thread.

Only call this method when the calling process or thread owns the lock. An
`AssertionError` is raised if this method is called by a process or thread
other than the owner or if the lock is in an unlocked (unowned) state. Note
that the type of exception raised in this situation differs from the
implemented behavior in `threading.RLock.release()`.

`class multiprocessing.Semaphore([value])`

    
A semaphore object: a close analog of `threading.Semaphore`.

A solitary difference from its close analog exists: its `acquire` method’s
first argument is named block, as is consistent with `Lock.acquire()`.

Note

On Mac OS X, `sem_timedwait` is unsupported, so calling `acquire()` with a
timeout will emulate that function’s behavior using a sleeping loop.

Note

If the SIGINT signal generated by `Ctrl-C` arrives while the main thread is
blocked by a call to `BoundedSemaphore.acquire()`, `Lock.acquire()`,
`RLock.acquire()`, `Semaphore.acquire()`, `Condition.acquire()` or
`Condition.wait()` then the call will be immediately interrupted and
`KeyboardInterrupt` will be raised.

This differs from the behaviour of `threading` where SIGINT will be ignored
while the equivalent blocking calls are in progress.

Note

Some of this package’s functionality requires a functioning shared semaphore
implementation on the host operating system. Without one, the
`multiprocessing.synchronize` module will be disabled, and attempts to import
it will result in an `ImportError`. See bpo-3770 for additional information.

### Shared `ctypes` Objects

It is possible to create shared objects using shared memory which can be
inherited by child processes.

`multiprocessing.Value(typecode_or_type, *args, lock=True)`

    
Return a `ctypes` object allocated from shared memory. By default the return
value is actually a synchronized wrapper for the object. The object itself can
be accessed via the value attribute of a `Value`.

typecode_or_type determines the type of the returned object: it is either a
ctypes type or a one character typecode of the kind used by the `array`
module. *args is passed on to the constructor for the type.

If lock is `True` (the default) then a new recursive lock object is created to
synchronize access to the value. If lock is a `Lock` or `RLock` object then
that will be used to synchronize access to the value. If lock is `False` then
access to the returned object will not be automatically protected by a lock,
so it will not necessarily be “process-safe”.

Operations like `+=` which involve a read and write are not atomic. So if, for
instance, you want to atomically increment a shared value it is insufficient
to just do

    
    counter.value += 1
    
Assuming the associated lock is recursive (which it is by default) you can
instead do

    
    with counter.get_lock():
        counter.value += 1
    
Note that lock is a keyword-only argument.

`multiprocessing.Array(typecode_or_type, size_or_initializer, *, lock=True)`

    
Return a ctypes array allocated from shared memory. By default the return
value is actually a synchronized wrapper for the array.

typecode_or_type determines the type of the elements of the returned array: it
is either a ctypes type or a one character typecode of the kind used by the
`array` module. If size_or_initializer is an integer, then it determines the
length of the array, and the array will be initially zeroed. Otherwise,
size_or_initializer is a sequence which is used to initialize the array and
whose length determines the length of the array.

If lock is `True` (the default) then a new lock object is created to
synchronize access to the value. If lock is a `Lock` or `RLock` object then
that will be used to synchronize access to the value. If lock is `False` then
access to the returned object will not be automatically protected by a lock,
so it will not necessarily be “process-safe”.

Note that lock is a keyword only argument.

Note that an array of `ctypes.c_char` has value and raw attributes which allow
one to use it to store and retrieve strings.

#### The `multiprocessing.sharedctypes` module

The `multiprocessing.sharedctypes` module provides functions for allocating
`ctypes` objects from shared memory which can be inherited by child processes.

Note

Although it is possible to store a pointer in shared memory remember that this
will refer to a location in the address space of a specific process. However,
the pointer is quite likely to be invalid in the context of a second process
and trying to dereference the pointer from the second process may cause a
crash.

`multiprocessing.sharedctypes.RawArray(typecode_or_type, size_or_initializer)`

    
Return a ctypes array allocated from shared memory.

typecode_or_type determines the type of the elements of the returned array: it
is either a ctypes type or a one character typecode of the kind used by the
`array` module. If size_or_initializer is an integer then it determines the
length of the array, and the array will be initially zeroed. Otherwise
size_or_initializer is a sequence which is used to initialize the array and
whose length determines the length of the array.

Note that setting and getting an element is potentially non-atomic – use
`Array()` instead to make sure that access is automatically synchronized using
a lock.

`multiprocessing.sharedctypes.RawValue(typecode_or_type, *args)`

    
Return a ctypes object allocated from shared memory.

typecode_or_type determines the type of the returned object: it is either a
ctypes type or a one character typecode of the kind used by the `array`
module. *args is passed on to the constructor for the type.

Note that setting and getting the value is potentially non-atomic – use
`Value()` instead to make sure that access is automatically synchronized using
a lock.

Note that an array of `ctypes.c_char` has `value` and `raw` attributes which
allow one to use it to store and retrieve strings – see documentation for
`ctypes`.

`multiprocessing.sharedctypes.Array(typecode_or_type, size_or_initializer, *,
lock=True)`

    
The same as `RawArray()` except that depending on the value of lock a process-
safe synchronization wrapper may be returned instead of a raw ctypes array.

If lock is `True` (the default) then a new lock object is created to
synchronize access to the value. If lock is a `Lock` or `RLock` object then
that will be used to synchronize access to the value. If lock is `False` then
access to the returned object will not be automatically protected by a lock,
so it will not necessarily be “process-safe”.

Note that lock is a keyword-only argument.

`multiprocessing.sharedctypes.Value(typecode_or_type, *args, lock=True)`

    
The same as `RawValue()` except that depending on the value of lock a process-
safe synchronization wrapper may be returned instead of a raw ctypes object.

If lock is `True` (the default) then a new lock object is created to
synchronize access to the value. If lock is a `Lock` or `RLock` object then
that will be used to synchronize access to the value. If lock is `False` then
access to the returned object will not be automatically protected by a lock,
so it will not necessarily be “process-safe”.

Note that lock is a keyword-only argument.

`multiprocessing.sharedctypes.copy(obj)`

    
Return a ctypes object allocated from shared memory which is a copy of the
ctypes object obj.

`multiprocessing.sharedctypes.synchronized(obj[, lock])`

    
Return a process-safe wrapper object for a ctypes object which uses lock to
synchronize access. If lock is `None` (the default) then a
`multiprocessing.RLock` object is created automatically.

A synchronized wrapper will have two methods in addition to those of the
object it wraps: `get_obj()` returns the wrapped object and `get_lock()`
returns the lock object used for synchronization.

Note that accessing the ctypes object through the wrapper can be a lot slower
than accessing the raw ctypes object.

Changed in version 3.5: Synchronized objects support the context manager
protocol.

The table below compares the syntax for creating shared ctypes objects from
shared memory with the normal ctypes syntax. (In the table `MyStruct` is some
subclass of `ctypes.Structure`.)

ctypes | sharedctypes using type | sharedctypes using typecode  
---|---|---  
c_double(2.4) | RawValue(c_double, 2.4) | RawValue(‘d’, 2.4)  
MyStruct(4, 6) | RawValue(MyStruct, 4, 6) |   
(c_short * 7)() | RawArray(c_short, 7) | RawArray(‘h’, 7)  
(c_int * 3)(9, 2, 8) | RawArray(c_int, (9, 2, 8)) | RawArray(‘i’, (9, 2, 8))  
Below is an example where a number of ctypes objects are modified by a child
process:

    
    from multiprocessing import Process, Lock
    from multiprocessing.sharedctypes import Value, Array
    from ctypes import Structure, c_double
    
    class Point(Structure):
        _fields_ = [('x', c_double), ('y', c_double)]
    
    def modify(n, x, s, A):
        n.value **= 2
        x.value **= 2
        s.value = s.value.upper()
        for a in A:
            a.x **= 2
            a.y **= 2
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        lock = Lock()
    
        n = Value('i', 7)
        x = Value(c_double, 1.0/3.0, lock=False)
        s = Array('c', b'hello world', lock=lock)
        A = Array(Point, [(1.875,-6.25), (-5.75,2.0), (2.375,9.5)], lock=lock)
    
        p = Process(target=modify, args=(n, x, s, A))
        p.start()
        p.join()
    
        print(n.value)
        print(x.value)
        print(s.value)
        print([(a.x, a.y) for a in A])
    
The results printed are

    
    49
    0.1111111111111111
    HELLO WORLD
    [(3.515625, 39.0625), (33.0625, 4.0), (5.640625, 90.25)]
    
### Managers

Managers provide a way to create data which can be shared between different
processes, including sharing over a network between processes running on
different machines. A manager object controls a server process which manages
shared objects. Other processes can access the shared objects by using
proxies.

`multiprocessing.Manager()`

    
Returns a started `SyncManager` object which can be used for sharing objects
between processes. The returned manager object corresponds to a spawned child
process and has methods which will create shared objects and return
corresponding proxies.

Manager processes will be shutdown as soon as they are garbage collected or
their parent process exits. The manager classes are defined in the
`multiprocessing.managers` module:

`class multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager([address[, authkey]])`

    
Create a BaseManager object.

Once created one should call `start()` or `get_server().serve_forever()` to
ensure that the manager object refers to a started manager process.

address is the address on which the manager process listens for new
connections. If address is `None` then an arbitrary one is chosen.

authkey is the authentication key which will be used to check the validity of
incoming connections to the server process. If authkey is `None` then
`current_process().authkey` is used. Otherwise authkey is used and it must be
a byte string.

`start([initializer[, initargs]])`

    
Start a subprocess to start the manager. If initializer is not `None` then the
subprocess will call `initializer(*initargs)` when it starts.

`get_server()`

    
Returns a `Server` object which represents the actual server under the control
of the Manager. The `Server` object supports the `serve_forever()` method:

    
    >>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
    >>> manager = BaseManager(address=('', 50000), authkey=b'abc')
    >>> server = manager.get_server()
    >>> server.serve_forever()
    
`Server` additionally has an `address` attribute.

`connect()`

    
Connect a local manager object to a remote manager process:

    
    >>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
    >>> m = BaseManager(address=('127.0.0.1', 50000), authkey=b'abc')
    >>> m.connect()
    
`shutdown()`

    
Stop the process used by the manager. This is only available if `start()` has
been used to start the server process.

This can be called multiple times.

`register(typeid[, callable[, proxytype[, exposed[, method_to_typeid[,
create_method]]]]])`

    
A classmethod which can be used for registering a type or callable with the
manager class.

typeid is a “type identifier” which is used to identify a particular type of
shared object. This must be a string.

callable is a callable used for creating objects for this type identifier. If
a manager instance will be connected to the server using the `connect()`
method, or if the create_method argument is `False` then this can be left as
`None`.

proxytype is a subclass of `BaseProxy` which is used to create proxies for
shared objects with this typeid. If `None` then a proxy class is created
automatically.

exposed is used to specify a sequence of method names which proxies for this
typeid should be allowed to access using `BaseProxy._callmethod()`. (If
exposed is `None` then `proxytype._exposed_` is used instead if it exists.) In
the case where no exposed list is specified, all “public methods” of the
shared object will be accessible. (Here a “public method” means any attribute
which has a `__call__()` method and whose name does not begin with `'_'`.)

method_to_typeid is a mapping used to specify the return type of those exposed
methods which should return a proxy. It maps method names to typeid strings.
(If method_to_typeid is `None` then `proxytype._method_to_typeid_` is used
instead if it exists.) If a method’s name is not a key of this mapping or if
the mapping is `None` then the object returned by the method will be copied by
value.

create_method determines whether a method should be created with name typeid
which can be used to tell the server process to create a new shared object and
return a proxy for it. By default it is `True`.

`BaseManager` instances also have one read-only property:

`address`

    
The address used by the manager.

Changed in version 3.3: Manager objects support the context management
protocol – see Context Manager Types. `__enter__()` starts the server process
(if it has not already started) and then returns the manager object.
`__exit__()` calls `shutdown()`.

In previous versions `__enter__()` did not start the manager’s server process
if it was not already started.

`class multiprocessing.managers.SyncManager`

    
A subclass of `BaseManager` which can be used for the synchronization of
processes. Objects of this type are returned by `multiprocessing.Manager()`.

Its methods create and return Proxy Objects for a number of commonly used data
types to be synchronized across processes. This notably includes shared lists
and dictionaries.

`Barrier(parties[, action[, timeout]])`

    
Create a shared `threading.Barrier` object and return a proxy for it.

New in version 3.3.

`BoundedSemaphore([value])`

    
Create a shared `threading.BoundedSemaphore` object and return a proxy for it.

`Condition([lock])`

    
Create a shared `threading.Condition` object and return a proxy for it.

If lock is supplied then it should be a proxy for a `threading.Lock` or
`threading.RLock` object.

Changed in version 3.3: The `wait_for()` method was added.

`Event()`

    
Create a shared `threading.Event` object and return a proxy for it.

`Lock()`

    
Create a shared `threading.Lock` object and return a proxy for it.

`Namespace()`

    
Create a shared `Namespace` object and return a proxy for it.

`Queue([maxsize])`

    
Create a shared `queue.Queue` object and return a proxy for it.

`RLock()`

    
Create a shared `threading.RLock` object and return a proxy for it.

`Semaphore([value])`

    
Create a shared `threading.Semaphore` object and return a proxy for it.

`Array(typecode, sequence)`

    
Create an array and return a proxy for it.

`Value(typecode, value)`

    
Create an object with a writable `value` attribute and return a proxy for it.

`dict()`

`dict(mapping)`

`dict(sequence)`

    
Create a shared `dict` object and return a proxy for it.

`list()`

`list(sequence)`

    
Create a shared `list` object and return a proxy for it.

Changed in version 3.6: Shared objects are capable of being nested. For
example, a shared container object such as a shared list can contain other
shared objects which will all be managed and synchronized by the
`SyncManager`.

`class multiprocessing.managers.Namespace`

    
A type that can register with `SyncManager`.

A namespace object has no public methods, but does have writable attributes.
Its representation shows the values of its attributes.

However, when using a proxy for a namespace object, an attribute beginning
with `'_'` will be an attribute of the proxy and not an attribute of the
referent:

    
    >>> manager = multiprocessing.Manager()
    >>> Global = manager.Namespace()
    >>> Global.x = 10
    >>> Global.y = 'hello'
    >>> Global._z = 12.3    # this is an attribute of the proxy
    >>> print(Global)
    Namespace(x=10, y='hello')
    
#### Customized managers

To create one’s own manager, one creates a subclass of `BaseManager` and uses
the `register()` classmethod to register new types or callables with the
manager class. For example:

    
    from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
    
    class MathsClass:
        def add(self, x, y):
            return x + y
        def mul(self, x, y):
            return x * y
    
    class MyManager(BaseManager):
        pass
    
    MyManager.register('Maths', MathsClass)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with MyManager() as manager:
            maths = manager.Maths()
            print(maths.add(4, 3))         # prints 7
            print(maths.mul(7, 8))         # prints 56
    
#### Using a remote manager

It is possible to run a manager server on one machine and have clients use it
from other machines (assuming that the firewalls involved allow it).

Running the following commands creates a server for a single shared queue
which remote clients can access:

    
    >>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
    >>> from queue import Queue
    >>> queue = Queue()
    >>> class QueueManager(BaseManager): pass
    >>> QueueManager.register('get_queue', callable=lambda:queue)
    >>> m = QueueManager(address=('', 50000), authkey=b'abracadabra')
    >>> s = m.get_server()
    >>> s.serve_forever()
    
One client can access the server as follows:

    
    >>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
    >>> class QueueManager(BaseManager): pass
    >>> QueueManager.register('get_queue')
    >>> m = QueueManager(address=('foo.bar.org', 50000), authkey=b'abracadabra')
    >>> m.connect()
    >>> queue = m.get_queue()
    >>> queue.put('hello')
    
Another client can also use it:

    
    >>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
    >>> class QueueManager(BaseManager): pass
    >>> QueueManager.register('get_queue')
    >>> m = QueueManager(address=('foo.bar.org', 50000), authkey=b'abracadabra')
    >>> m.connect()
    >>> queue = m.get_queue()
    >>> queue.get()
    'hello'
    
Local processes can also access that queue, using the code from above on the
client to access it remotely:

    
    >>> from multiprocessing import Process, Queue
    >>> from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager
    >>> class Worker(Process):
    ...     def __init__(self, q):
    ...         self.q = q
    ...         super().__init__()
    ...     def run(self):
    ...         self.q.put('local hello')
    ...
    >>> queue = Queue()
    >>> w = Worker(queue)
    >>> w.start()
    >>> class QueueManager(BaseManager): pass
    ...
    >>> QueueManager.register('get_queue', callable=lambda: queue)
    >>> m = QueueManager(address=('', 50000), authkey=b'abracadabra')
    >>> s = m.get_server()
    >>> s.serve_forever()
    
### Proxy Objects

A proxy is an object which refers to a shared object which lives (presumably)
in a different process. The shared object is said to be the referent of the
proxy. Multiple proxy objects may have the same referent.

A proxy object has methods which invoke corresponding methods of its referent
(although not every method of the referent will necessarily be available
through the proxy). In this way, a proxy can be used just like its referent
can:

    
    >>> from multiprocessing import Manager
    >>> manager = Manager()
    >>> l = manager.list([i*i for i in range(10)])
    >>> print(l)
    [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
    >>> print(repr(l))
    <ListProxy object, typeid 'list' at 0x...>
    >>> l[4]
    16
    >>> l[2:5]
    [4, 9, 16]
    
Notice that applying `str()` to a proxy will return the representation of the
referent, whereas applying `repr()` will return the representation of the
proxy.

An important feature of proxy objects is that they are picklable so they can
be passed between processes. As such, a referent can contain Proxy Objects.
This permits nesting of these managed lists, dicts, and other Proxy Objects:

    
    >>> a = manager.list()
    >>> b = manager.list()
    >>> a.append(b)         # referent of a now contains referent of b
    >>> print(a, b)
    [<ListProxy object, typeid 'list' at ...>] []
    >>> b.append('hello')
    >>> print(a[0], b)
    ['hello'] ['hello']
    
Similarly, dict and list proxies may be nested inside one another:

    
    >>> l_outer = manager.list([ manager.dict() for i in range(2) ])
    >>> d_first_inner = l_outer[0]
    >>> d_first_inner['a'] = 1
    >>> d_first_inner['b'] = 2
    >>> l_outer[1]['c'] = 3
    >>> l_outer[1]['z'] = 26
    >>> print(l_outer[0])
    {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
    >>> print(l_outer[1])
    {'c': 3, 'z': 26}
    
If standard (non-proxy) `list` or `dict` objects are contained in a referent,
modifications to those mutable values will not be propagated through the
manager because the proxy has no way of knowing when the values contained
within are modified. However, storing a value in a container proxy (which
triggers a `__setitem__` on the proxy object) does propagate through the
manager and so to effectively modify such an item, one could re-assign the
modified value to the container proxy:

    
    # create a list proxy and append a mutable object (a dictionary)
    lproxy = manager.list()
    lproxy.append({})
    # now mutate the dictionary
    d = lproxy[0]
    d['a'] = 1
    d['b'] = 2
    # at this point, the changes to d are not yet synced, but by
    # updating the dictionary, the proxy is notified of the change
    lproxy[0] = d
    
This approach is perhaps less convenient than employing nested Proxy Objects
for most use cases but also demonstrates a level of control over the
synchronization.

Note

The proxy types in `multiprocessing` do nothing to support comparisons by
value. So, for instance, we have:

    
    >>> manager.list([1,2,3]) == [1,2,3]
    False
    
One should just use a copy of the referent instead when making comparisons.

`class multiprocessing.managers.BaseProxy`

    
Proxy objects are instances of subclasses of `BaseProxy`.

`_callmethod(methodname[, args[, kwds]])`

    
Call and return the result of a method of the proxy’s referent.

If `proxy` is a proxy whose referent is `obj` then the expression

    
    proxy._callmethod(methodname, args, kwds)
    
will evaluate the expression

    
    getattr(obj, methodname)(*args, **kwds)
    
in the manager’s process.

The returned value will be a copy of the result of the call or a proxy to a
new shared object – see documentation for the method_to_typeid argument of
`BaseManager.register()`.

If an exception is raised by the call, then is re-raised by `_callmethod()`.
If some other exception is raised in the manager’s process then this is
converted into a `RemoteError` exception and is raised by `_callmethod()`.

Note in particular that an exception will be raised if methodname has not been
exposed.

An example of the usage of `_callmethod()`:

    
    >>> l = manager.list(range(10))
    >>> l._callmethod('__len__')
    10
    >>> l._callmethod('__getitem__', (slice(2, 7),)) # equivalent to l[2:7]
    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    >>> l._callmethod('__getitem__', (20,))          # equivalent to l[20]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    IndexError: list index out of range
    
`_getvalue()`

    
Return a copy of the referent.

If the referent is unpicklable then this will raise an exception.

`__repr__()`

    
Return a representation of the proxy object.

`__str__()`

    
Return the representation of the referent.

#### Cleanup

A proxy object uses a weakref callback so that when it gets garbage collected
it deregisters itself from the manager which owns its referent.

A shared object gets deleted from the manager process when there are no longer
any proxies referring to it.

### Process Pools

One can create a pool of processes which will carry out tasks submitted to it
with the `Pool` class.

`class multiprocessing.pool.Pool([processes[, initializer[, initargs[,
maxtasksperchild[, context]]]]])`

    
A process pool object which controls a pool of worker processes to which jobs
can be submitted. It supports asynchronous results with timeouts and callbacks
and has a parallel map implementation.

processes is the number of worker processes to use. If processes is `None`
then the number returned by `os.cpu_count()` is used.

If initializer is not `None` then each worker process will call
`initializer(*initargs)` when it starts.

maxtasksperchild is the number of tasks a worker process can complete before
it will exit and be replaced with a fresh worker process, to enable unused
resources to be freed. The default maxtasksperchild is `None`, which means
worker processes will live as long as the pool.

context can be used to specify the context used for starting the worker
processes. Usually a pool is created using the function
`multiprocessing.Pool()` or the `Pool()` method of a context object. In both
cases context is set appropriately.

Note that the methods of the pool object should only be called by the process
which created the pool.

Warning

`multiprocessing.pool` objects have internal resources that need to be
properly managed (like any other resource) by using the pool as a context
manager or by calling `close()` and `terminate()` manually. Failure to do this
can lead to the process hanging on finalization.

Note that is not correct to rely on the garbage colletor to destroy the pool
as CPython does not assure that the finalizer of the pool will be called (see
`object.__del__()` for more information).

New in version 3.2: maxtasksperchild

New in version 3.4: context

Note

Worker processes within a `Pool` typically live for the complete duration of
the Pool’s work queue. A frequent pattern found in other systems (such as
Apache, mod_wsgi, etc) to free resources held by workers is to allow a worker
within a pool to complete only a set amount of work before being exiting,
being cleaned up and a new process spawned to replace the old one. The
maxtasksperchild argument to the `Pool` exposes this ability to the end user.

`apply(func[, args[, kwds]])`

    
Call func with arguments args and keyword arguments kwds. It blocks until the
result is ready. Given this blocks, `apply_async()` is better suited for
performing work in parallel. Additionally, func is only executed in one of the
workers of the pool.

`apply_async(func[, args[, kwds[, callback[, error_callback]]]])`

    
A variant of the `apply()` method which returns a `AsyncResult` object.

If callback is specified then it should be a callable which accepts a single
argument. When the result becomes ready callback is applied to it, that is
unless the call failed, in which case the error_callback is applied instead.

If error_callback is specified then it should be a callable which accepts a
single argument. If the target function fails, then the error_callback is
called with the exception instance.

Callbacks should complete immediately since otherwise the thread which handles
the results will get blocked.

`map(func, iterable[, chunksize])`

    
A parallel equivalent of the `map()` built-in function (it supports only one
iterable argument though, for multiple iterables see `starmap()`). It blocks
until the result is ready.

This method chops the iterable into a number of chunks which it submits to the
process pool as separate tasks. The (approximate) size of these chunks can be
specified by setting chunksize to a positive integer.

Note that it may cause high memory usage for very long iterables. Consider
using `imap()` or `imap_unordered()` with explicit chunksize option for better
efficiency.

`map_async(func, iterable[, chunksize[, callback[, error_callback]]])`

    
A variant of the `map()` method which returns a `AsyncResult` object.

If callback is specified then it should be a callable which accepts a single
argument. When the result becomes ready callback is applied to it, that is
unless the call failed, in which case the error_callback is applied instead.

If error_callback is specified then it should be a callable which accepts a
single argument. If the target function fails, then the error_callback is
called with the exception instance.

Callbacks should complete immediately since otherwise the thread which handles
the results will get blocked.

`imap(func, iterable[, chunksize])`

    
A lazier version of `map()`.

The chunksize argument is the same as the one used by the `map()` method. For
very long iterables using a large value for chunksize can make the job
complete much faster than using the default value of `1`.

Also if chunksize is `1` then the `next()` method of the iterator returned by
the `imap()` method has an optional timeout parameter: `next(timeout)` will
raise `multiprocessing.TimeoutError` if the result cannot be returned within
timeout seconds.

`imap_unordered(func, iterable[, chunksize])`

    
The same as `imap()` except that the ordering of the results from the returned
iterator should be considered arbitrary. (Only when there is only one worker
process is the order guaranteed to be “correct”.)

`starmap(func, iterable[, chunksize])`

    
Like `map()` except that the elements of the iterable are expected to be
iterables that are unpacked as arguments.

Hence an iterable of `[(1,2), (3, 4)]` results in `[func(1,2), func(3,4)]`.

New in version 3.3.

`starmap_async(func, iterable[, chunksize[, callback[, error_callback]]])`

    
A combination of `starmap()` and `map_async()` that iterates over iterable of
iterables and calls func with the iterables unpacked. Returns a result object.

New in version 3.3.

`close()`

    
Prevents any more tasks from being submitted to the pool. Once all the tasks
have been completed the worker processes will exit.

`terminate()`

    
Stops the worker processes immediately without completing outstanding work.
When the pool object is garbage collected `terminate()` will be called
immediately.

`join()`

    
Wait for the worker processes to exit. One must call `close()` or
`terminate()` before using `join()`.

New in version 3.3: Pool objects now support the context management protocol –
see Context Manager Types. `__enter__()` returns the pool object, and
`__exit__()` calls `terminate()`.

`class multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult`

    
The class of the result returned by `Pool.apply_async()` and
`Pool.map_async()`.

`get([timeout])`

    
Return the result when it arrives. If timeout is not `None` and the result
does not arrive within timeout seconds then `multiprocessing.TimeoutError` is
raised. If the remote call raised an exception then that exception will be
reraised by `get()`.

`wait([timeout])`

    
Wait until the result is available or until timeout seconds pass.

`ready()`

    
Return whether the call has completed.

`successful()`

    
Return whether the call completed without raising an exception. Will raise
`ValueError` if the result is not ready.

Changed in version 3.7: If the result is not ready, `ValueError` is raised
instead of `AssertionError`.

The following example demonstrates the use of a pool:

    
    from multiprocessing import Pool
    import time
    
    def f(x):
        return x*x
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with Pool(processes=4) as pool:         # start 4 worker processes
            result = pool.apply_async(f, (10,)) # evaluate "f(10)" asynchronously in a single process
            print(result.get(timeout=1))        # prints "100" unless your computer is *very* slow
    
            print(pool.map(f, range(10)))       # prints "[0, 1, 4,..., 81]"
    
            it = pool.imap(f, range(10))
            print(next(it))                     # prints "0"
            print(next(it))                     # prints "1"
            print(it.next(timeout=1))           # prints "4" unless your computer is *very* slow
    
            result = pool.apply_async(time.sleep, (10,))
            print(result.get(timeout=1))        # raises multiprocessing.TimeoutError
    
### Listeners and Clients

Usually message passing between processes is done using queues or by using
`Connection` objects returned by `Pipe()`.

However, the `multiprocessing.connection` module allows some extra
flexibility. It basically gives a high level message oriented API for dealing
with sockets or Windows named pipes. It also has support for digest
authentication using the `hmac` module, and for polling multiple connections
at the same time.

`multiprocessing.connection.deliver_challenge(connection, authkey)`

    
Send a randomly generated message to the other end of the connection and wait
for a reply.

If the reply matches the digest of the message using authkey as the key then a
welcome message is sent to the other end of the connection. Otherwise
`AuthenticationError` is raised.

`multiprocessing.connection.answer_challenge(connection, authkey)`

    
Receive a message, calculate the digest of the message using authkey as the
key, and then send the digest back.

If a welcome message is not received, then `AuthenticationError` is raised.

`multiprocessing.connection.Client(address[, family[, authkey]])`

    
Attempt to set up a connection to the listener which is using address address,
returning a `Connection`.

The type of the connection is determined by family argument, but this can
generally be omitted since it can usually be inferred from the format of
address. (See Address Formats)

If authkey is given and not None, it should be a byte string and will be used
as the secret key for an HMAC-based authentication challenge. No
authentication is done if authkey is None. `AuthenticationError` is raised if
authentication fails. See Authentication keys.

`class multiprocessing.connection.Listener([address[, family[, backlog[,
authkey]]]])`

    
A wrapper for a bound socket or Windows named pipe which is ‘listening’ for
connections.

address is the address to be used by the bound socket or named pipe of the
listener object.

Note

If an address of ‘0.0.0.0’ is used, the address will not be a connectable end
point on Windows. If you require a connectable end-point, you should use
‘127.0.0.1’.

family is the type of socket (or named pipe) to use. This can be one of the
strings `'AF_INET'` (for a TCP socket), `'AF_UNIX'` (for a Unix domain socket)
or `'AF_PIPE'` (for a Windows named pipe). Of these only the first is
guaranteed to be available. If family is `None` then the family is inferred
from the format of address. If address is also `None` then a default is
chosen. This default is the family which is assumed to be the fastest
available. See Address Formats. Note that if family is `'AF_UNIX'` and address
is `None` then the socket will be created in a private temporary directory
created using `tempfile.mkstemp()`.

If the listener object uses a socket then backlog (1 by default) is passed to
the `listen()` method of the socket once it has been bound.

If authkey is given and not None, it should be a byte string and will be used
as the secret key for an HMAC-based authentication challenge. No
authentication is done if authkey is None. `AuthenticationError` is raised if
authentication fails. See Authentication keys.

`accept()`

    
Accept a connection on the bound socket or named pipe of the listener object
and return a `Connection` object. If authentication is attempted and fails,
then `AuthenticationError` is raised.

`close()`

    
Close the bound socket or named pipe of the listener object. This is called
automatically when the listener is garbage collected. However it is advisable
to call it explicitly.

Listener objects have the following read-only properties:

`address`

    
The address which is being used by the Listener object.

`last_accepted`

    
The address from which the last accepted connection came. If this is
unavailable then it is `None`.

New in version 3.3: Listener objects now support the context management
protocol – see Context Manager Types. `__enter__()` returns the listener
object, and `__exit__()` calls `close()`.

`multiprocessing.connection.wait(object_list, timeout=None)`

    
Wait till an object in object_list is ready. Returns the list of those objects
in object_list which are ready. If timeout is a float then the call blocks for
at most that many seconds. If timeout is `None` then it will block for an
unlimited period. A negative timeout is equivalent to a zero timeout.

For both Unix and Windows, an object can appear in object_list if it is

  * a readable `Connection` object;
  * a connected and readable `socket.socket` object; or
  * the `sentinel` attribute of a `Process` object.

A connection or socket object is ready when there is data available to be read
from it, or the other end has been closed.

Unix: `wait(object_list, timeout)` almost equivalent
`select.select(object_list, [], [], timeout)`. The difference is that, if
`select.select()` is interrupted by a signal, it can raise `OSError` with an
error number of `EINTR`, whereas `wait()` will not.

Windows: An item in object_list must either be an integer handle which is
waitable (according to the definition used by the documentation of the Win32
function `WaitForMultipleObjects()`) or it can be an object with a `fileno()`
method which returns a socket handle or pipe handle. (Note that pipe handles
and socket handles are not waitable handles.)

New in version 3.3.

Examples

The following server code creates a listener which uses `'secret password'` as
an authentication key. It then waits for a connection and sends some data to
the client:

    
    from multiprocessing.connection import Listener
    from array import array
    
    address = ('localhost', 6000)     # family is deduced to be 'AF_INET'
    
    with Listener(address, authkey=b'secret password') as listener:
        with listener.accept() as conn:
            print('connection accepted from', listener.last_accepted)
    
            conn.send([2.25, None, 'junk', float])
    
            conn.send_bytes(b'hello')
    
            conn.send_bytes(array('i', [42, 1729]))
    
The following code connects to the server and receives some data from the
server:

    
    from multiprocessing.connection import Client
    from array import array
    
    address = ('localhost', 6000)
    
    with Client(address, authkey=b'secret password') as conn:
        print(conn.recv())                  # => [2.25, None, 'junk', float]
    
        print(conn.recv_bytes())            # => 'hello'
    
        arr = array('i', [0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
        print(conn.recv_bytes_into(arr))    # => 8
        print(arr)                          # => array('i', [42, 1729, 0, 0, 0])
    
The following code uses `wait()` to wait for messages from multiple processes
at once:

    
    import time, random
    from multiprocessing import Process, Pipe, current_process
    from multiprocessing.connection import wait
    
    def foo(w):
        for i in range(10):
            w.send((i, current_process().name))
        w.close()
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        readers = []
    
        for i in range(4):
            r, w = Pipe(duplex=False)
            readers.append(r)
            p = Process(target=foo, args=(w,))
            p.start()
            # We close the writable end of the pipe now to be sure that
            # p is the only process which owns a handle for it.  This
            # ensures that when p closes its handle for the writable end,
            # wait() will promptly report the readable end as being ready.
            w.close()
    
        while readers:
            for r in wait(readers):
                try:
                    msg = r.recv()
                except EOFError:
                    readers.remove(r)
                else:
                    print(msg)
    
#### Address Formats

  * An `'AF_INET'` address is a tuple of the form `(hostname, port)` where hostname is a string and port is an integer.
  * An `'AF_UNIX'` address is a string representing a filename on the filesystem.
  * An `'AF_PIPE'` address is a string of the form `r'\.\pipe{PipeName}'`. To use `Client()` to connect to a named pipe on a remote computer called ServerName one should use an address of the form `r'\ServerName\pipe{PipeName}'` instead.

Note that any string beginning with two backslashes is assumed by default to
be an `'AF_PIPE'` address rather than an `'AF_UNIX'` address.

### Authentication keys

When one uses `Connection.recv`, the data received is automatically unpickled.
Unfortunately unpickling data from an untrusted source is a security risk.
Therefore `Listener` and `Client()` use the `hmac` module to provide digest
authentication.

An authentication key is a byte string which can be thought of as a password:
once a connection is established both ends will demand proof that the other
knows the authentication key. (Demonstrating that both ends are using the same
key does not involve sending the key over the connection.)

If authentication is requested but no authentication key is specified then the
return value of `current_process().authkey` is used (see `Process`). This
value will be automatically inherited by any `Process` object that the current
process creates. This means that (by default) all processes of a multi-process
program will share a single authentication key which can be used when setting
up connections between themselves.

Suitable authentication keys can also be generated by using `os.urandom()`.

### Logging

Some support for logging is available. Note, however, that the `logging`
package does not use process shared locks so it is possible (depending on the
handler type) for messages from different processes to get mixed up.

`multiprocessing.get_logger()`

    
Returns the logger used by `multiprocessing`. If necessary, a new one will be
created.

When first created the logger has level `logging.NOTSET` and no default
handler. Messages sent to this logger will not by default propagate to the
root logger.

Note that on Windows child processes will only inherit the level of the parent
process’s logger – any other customization of the logger will not be
inherited.

`multiprocessing.log_to_stderr()`

    
This function performs a call to `get_logger()` but in addition to returning
the logger created by get_logger, it adds a handler which sends output to
`sys.stderr` using format `'[%(levelname)s/%(processName)s] %(message)s'`.

Below is an example session with logging turned on:

    
    >>> import multiprocessing, logging
    >>> logger = multiprocessing.log_to_stderr()
    >>> logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    >>> logger.warning('doomed')
    [WARNING/MainProcess] doomed
    >>> m = multiprocessing.Manager()
    [INFO/SyncManager-...] child process calling self.run()
    [INFO/SyncManager-...] created temp directory /.../pymp-...
    [INFO/SyncManager-...] manager serving at '/.../listener-...'
    >>> del m
    [INFO/MainProcess] sending shutdown message to manager
    [INFO/SyncManager-...] manager exiting with exitcode 0
    
For a full table of logging levels, see the `logging` module.

### The `multiprocessing.dummy` module

`multiprocessing.dummy` replicates the API of `multiprocessing` but is no more
than a wrapper around the `threading` module.

In particular, the `Pool` function provided by `multiprocessing.dummy` returns
an instance of `ThreadPool`, which is a subclass of `Pool` that supports all
the same method calls but uses a pool of worker threads rather than worker
processes.

`class multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool([processes[, initializer[,
initargs]]])`

    
A thread pool object which controls a pool of worker threads to which jobs can
be submitted. `ThreadPool` instances are fully interface compatible with
`Pool` instances, and their resources must also be properly managed, either by
using the pool as a context manager or by calling `close()` and `terminate()`
manually.

processes is the number of worker threads to use. If processes is `None` then
the number returned by `os.cpu_count()` is used.

If initializer is not `None` then each worker process will call
`initializer(*initargs)` when it starts.

Unlike `Pool`, maxtasksperchild and context cannot be provided.

Note

A `ThreadPool` shares the same interface as `Pool`, which is designed around a
pool of processes and predates the introduction of the `concurrent.futures`
module. As such, it inherits some operations that don’t make sense for a pool
backed by threads, and it has its own type for representing the status of
asynchronous jobs, `AsyncResult`, that is not understood by any other
libraries.

Users should generally prefer to use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`,
which has a simpler interface that was designed around threads from the start,
and which returns `concurrent.futures.Future` instances that are compatible
with many other libraries, including `asyncio`.

## Programming guidelines

There are certain guidelines and idioms which should be adhered to when using
`multiprocessing`.

### All start methods

The following applies to all start methods.

Avoid shared state

As far as possible one should try to avoid shifting large amounts of data
between processes.

It is probably best to stick to using queues or pipes for communication
between processes rather than using the lower level synchronization
primitives.

Picklability

Ensure that the arguments to the methods of proxies are picklable.

Thread safety of proxies

Do not use a proxy object from more than one thread unless you protect it with
a lock.

(There is never a problem with different processes using the same proxy.)

Joining zombie processes

On Unix when a process finishes but has not been joined it becomes a zombie.
There should never be very many because each time a new process starts (or
`active_children()` is called) all completed processes which have not yet been
joined will be joined. Also calling a finished process’s `Process.is_alive`
will join the process. Even so it is probably good practice to explicitly join
all the processes that you start.

Better to inherit than pickle/unpickle

When using the spawn or forkserver start methods many types from
`multiprocessing` need to be picklable so that child processes can use them.
However, one should generally avoid sending shared objects to other processes
using pipes or queues. Instead you should arrange the program so that a
process which needs access to a shared resource created elsewhere can inherit
it from an ancestor process.

Avoid terminating processes

Using the `Process.terminate` method to stop a process is liable to cause any
shared resources (such as locks, semaphores, pipes and queues) currently being
used by the process to become broken or unavailable to other processes.

Therefore it is probably best to only consider using `Process.terminate` on
processes which never use any shared resources.

Joining processes that use queues

Bear in mind that a process that has put items in a queue will wait before
terminating until all the buffered items are fed by the “feeder” thread to the
underlying pipe. (The child process can call the `Queue.cancel_join_thread`
method of the queue to avoid this behaviour.)

This means that whenever you use a queue you need to make sure that all items
which have been put on the queue will eventually be removed before the process
is joined. Otherwise you cannot be sure that processes which have put items on
the queue will terminate. Remember also that non-daemonic processes will be
joined automatically.

An example which will deadlock is the following:

    
    from multiprocessing import Process, Queue
    
    def f(q):
        q.put('X' * 1000000)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        queue = Queue()
        p = Process(target=f, args=(queue,))
        p.start()
        p.join()                    # this deadlocks
        obj = queue.get()
    
A fix here would be to swap the last two lines (or simply remove the
`p.join()` line).

Explicitly pass resources to child processes

On Unix using the fork start method, a child process can make use of a shared
resource created in a parent process using a global resource. However, it is
better to pass the object as an argument to the constructor for the child
process.

Apart from making the code (potentially) compatible with Windows and the other
start methods this also ensures that as long as the child process is still
alive the object will not be garbage collected in the parent process. This
might be important if some resource is freed when the object is garbage
collected in the parent process.

So for instance

    
    from multiprocessing import Process, Lock
    
    def f():
        ... do something using "lock" ...
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        lock = Lock()
        for i in range(10):
            Process(target=f).start()
    
should be rewritten as

    
    from multiprocessing import Process, Lock
    
    def f(l):
        ... do something using "l" ...
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        lock = Lock()
        for i in range(10):
            Process(target=f, args=(lock,)).start()
    
Beware of replacing `sys.stdin` with a “file like object”

`multiprocessing` originally unconditionally called:

    
    os.close(sys.stdin.fileno())
    
in the `multiprocessing.Process._bootstrap()` method — this resulted in issues
with processes-in-processes. This has been changed to:

    
    sys.stdin.close()
    sys.stdin = open(os.open(os.devnull, os.O_RDONLY), closefd=False)
    
Which solves the fundamental issue of processes colliding with each other
resulting in a bad file descriptor error, but introduces a potential danger to
applications which replace `sys.stdin()` with a “file-like object” with output
buffering. This danger is that if multiple processes call `close()` on this
file-like object, it could result in the same data being flushed to the object
multiple times, resulting in corruption.

If you write a file-like object and implement your own caching, you can make
it fork-safe by storing the pid whenever you append to the cache, and
discarding the cache when the pid changes. For example:

    
    @property
    def cache(self):
        pid = os.getpid()
        if pid != self._pid:
            self._pid = pid
            self._cache = []
        return self._cache
    
For more information, see bpo-5155, bpo-5313 and bpo-5331

### The spawn and forkserver start methods

There are a few extra restriction which don’t apply to the fork start method.

More picklability

Ensure that all arguments to `Process.__init__()` are picklable. Also, if you
subclass `Process` then make sure that instances will be picklable when the
`Process.start` method is called.

Global variables

Bear in mind that if code run in a child process tries to access a global
variable, then the value it sees (if any) may not be the same as the value in
the parent process at the time that `Process.start` was called.

However, global variables which are just module level constants cause no
problems.

Safe importing of main module

Make sure that the main module can be safely imported by a new Python
interpreter without causing unintended side effects (such a starting a new
process).

For example, using the spawn or forkserver start method running the following
module would fail with a `RuntimeError`:

    
    from multiprocessing import Process
    
    def foo():
        print('hello')
    
    p = Process(target=foo)
    p.start()
    
Instead one should protect the “entry point” of the program by using `if
__name__ == '__main__':` as follows:

    
    from multiprocessing import Process, freeze_support, set_start_method
    
    def foo():
        print('hello')
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        freeze_support()
        set_start_method('spawn')
        p = Process(target=foo)
        p.start()
    
(The `freeze_support()` line can be omitted if the program will be run
normally instead of frozen.)

This allows the newly spawned Python interpreter to safely import the module
and then run the module’s `foo()` function.

Similar restrictions apply if a pool or manager is created in the main module.

## Examples

Demonstration of how to create and use customized managers and proxies:

    
    from multiprocessing import freeze_support
    from multiprocessing.managers import BaseManager, BaseProxy
    import operator
    
    ##
    
    class Foo:
        def f(self):
            print('you called Foo.f()')
        def g(self):
            print('you called Foo.g()')
        def _h(self):
            print('you called Foo._h()')
    
    # A simple generator function
    def baz():
        for i in range(10):
            yield i*i
    
    # Proxy type for generator objects
    class GeneratorProxy(BaseProxy):
        _exposed_ = ['__next__']
        def __iter__(self):
            return self
        def __next__(self):
            return self._callmethod('__next__')
    
    # Function to return the operator module
    def get_operator_module():
        return operator
    
    ##
    
    class MyManager(BaseManager):
        pass
    
    # register the Foo class; make `f()` and `g()` accessible via proxy
    MyManager.register('Foo1', Foo)
    
    # register the Foo class; make `g()` and `_h()` accessible via proxy
    MyManager.register('Foo2', Foo, exposed=('g', '_h'))
    
    # register the generator function baz; use `GeneratorProxy` to make proxies
    MyManager.register('baz', baz, proxytype=GeneratorProxy)
    
    # register get_operator_module(); make public functions accessible via proxy
    MyManager.register('operator', get_operator_module)
    
    ##
    
    def test():
        manager = MyManager()
        manager.start()
    
        print('-' * 20)
    
        f1 = manager.Foo1()
        f1.f()
        f1.g()
        assert not hasattr(f1, '_h')
        assert sorted(f1._exposed_) == sorted(['f', 'g'])
    
        print('-' * 20)
    
        f2 = manager.Foo2()
        f2.g()
        f2._h()
        assert not hasattr(f2, 'f')
        assert sorted(f2._exposed_) == sorted(['g', '_h'])
    
        print('-' * 20)
    
        it = manager.baz()
        for i in it:
            print('<%d>' % i, end=' ')
        print()
    
        print('-' * 20)
    
        op = manager.operator()
        print('op.add(23, 45) =', op.add(23, 45))
        print('op.pow(2, 94) =', op.pow(2, 94))

An example showing how to use queues to feed tasks to a collection of worker
processes and collect the results:

    
    import time
    import random
    
    from multiprocessing import Process, Queue, current_process, freeze_support
    
    #
    # Function run by worker processes
    #
    
    def worker(input, output):
        for func, args in iter(input.get, 'STOP'):
            result = calculate(func, args)
            output.put(result)
    
    #
    # Function used to calculate result
    #
    
    def calculate(func, args):
        result = func(*args)
        return '%s says that %s%s = %s' % \
            (current_process().name, func.__name__, args, result)
    
    #
    # Functions referenced by tasks
    #
    
    def mul(a, b):
        time.sleep(0.5*random.random())
        return a * b
    
    def plus(a, b):
        time.sleep(0.5*random.random())
        return a + b
    
    #
    #
    #
    
    def test():
        NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES = 4
        TASKS1 = [(mul, (i, 7)) for i in range(20)]
        TASKS2 = [(plus, (i, 8)) for i in range(10)]

        task_queue = Queue()
        done_queue = Queue()
    
        # Submit tasks
        for task in TASKS1:
            task_queue.put(task)
    
        # Start worker processes
        for i in range(NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES):
            Process(target=worker, args=(task_queue, done_queue)).start()
    
        # Get and print results
        print('Unordered results:')
        for i in range(len(TASKS1)):
            print('\t', done_queue.get())
    
        # Add more tasks using `put()`
        for task in TASKS2:
            task_queue.put(task)
    
        # Get and print some more results
        for i in range(len(TASKS2)):
            print('\t', done_queue.get())
    
        # Tell child processes to stop
        for i in range(NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES):
            task_queue.put('STOP')
    
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        freeze_support()
        test()
