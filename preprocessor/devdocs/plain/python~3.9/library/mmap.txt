# mmap — Memory-mapped file support

Memory-mapped file objects behave like both `bytearray` and like file objects.
You can use mmap objects in most places where `bytearray` are expected; for
example, you can use the `re` module to search through a memory-mapped file.
You can also change a single byte by doing `obj[index] = 97`, or change a
subsequence by assigning to a slice: `obj[i1:i2] = b'...'`. You can also read
and write data starting at the current file position, and `seek()` through the
file to different positions.

A memory-mapped file is created by the `mmap` constructor, which is different
on Unix and on Windows. In either case you must provide a file descriptor for
a file opened for update. If you wish to map an existing Python file object,
use its `fileno()` method to obtain the correct value for the fileno
parameter. Otherwise, you can open the file using the `os.open()` function,
which returns a file descriptor directly (the file still needs to be closed
when done).

Note

If you want to create a memory-mapping for a writable, buffered file, you
should `flush()` the file first. This is necessary to ensure that local
modifications to the buffers are actually available to the mapping.

For both the Unix and Windows versions of the constructor, access may be
specified as an optional keyword parameter. access accepts one of four values:
`ACCESS_READ`, `ACCESS_WRITE`, or `ACCESS_COPY` to specify read-only, write-
through or copy-on-write memory respectively, or `ACCESS_DEFAULT` to defer to
prot. access can be used on both Unix and Windows. If access is not specified,
Windows mmap returns a write-through mapping. The initial memory values for
all three access types are taken from the specified file. Assignment to an
`ACCESS_READ` memory map raises a `TypeError` exception. Assignment to an
`ACCESS_WRITE` memory map affects both memory and the underlying file.
Assignment to an `ACCESS_COPY` memory map affects memory but does not update
the underlying file.

Changed in version 3.7: Added `ACCESS_DEFAULT` constant.

To map anonymous memory, -1 should be passed as the fileno along with the
length.

`class mmap.mmap(fileno, length, tagname=None, access=ACCESS_DEFAULT[,
offset])`

    
(Windows version) Maps length bytes from the file specified by the file handle
fileno, and creates a mmap object. If length is larger than the current size
of the file, the file is extended to contain length bytes. If length is `0`,
the maximum length of the map is the current size of the file, except that if
the file is empty Windows raises an exception (you cannot create an empty
mapping on Windows).

tagname, if specified and not `None`, is a string giving a tag name for the
mapping. Windows allows you to have many different mappings against the same
file. If you specify the name of an existing tag, that tag is opened,
otherwise a new tag of this name is created. If this parameter is omitted or
`None`, the mapping is created without a name. Avoiding the use of the tag
parameter will assist in keeping your code portable between Unix and Windows.

offset may be specified as a non-negative integer offset. mmap references will
be relative to the offset from the beginning of the file. offset defaults to
0. offset must be a multiple of the `ALLOCATIONGRANULARITY`.

Raises an auditing event `mmap.__new__` with arguments `fileno`, `length`,
`access`, `offset`.

`class mmap.mmap(fileno, length, flags=MAP_SHARED, prot=PROT_WRITE|PROT_READ,
access=ACCESS_DEFAULT[, offset])`

    
(Unix version) Maps length bytes from the file specified by the file
descriptor fileno, and returns a mmap object. If length is `0`, the maximum
length of the map will be the current size of the file when `mmap` is called.

flags specifies the nature of the mapping. `MAP_PRIVATE` creates a private
copy-on-write mapping, so changes to the contents of the mmap object will be
private to this process, and `MAP_SHARED` creates a mapping that’s shared with
all other processes mapping the same areas of the file. The default value is
`MAP_SHARED`.

prot, if specified, gives the desired memory protection; the two most useful values are `PROT_READ` and `PROT_WRITE`, to specify that the pages may be read or written. prot defaults to `PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE`.
access may be specified in lieu of flags and prot as an optional keyword
parameter. It is an error to specify both flags, prot and access. See the
description of access above for information on how to use this parameter.

offset may be specified as a non-negative integer offset. mmap references will
be relative to the offset from the beginning of the file. offset defaults to
0. offset must be a multiple of `ALLOCATIONGRANULARITY` which is equal to
`PAGESIZE` on Unix systems.

To ensure validity of the created memory mapping the file specified by the
descriptor fileno is internally automatically synchronized with physical
backing store on Mac OS X and OpenVMS.

This example shows a simple way of using `mmap`:

    
    import mmap
    
    # write a simple example file
    with open("hello.txt", "wb") as f:
        f.write(b"Hello Python!\n")
    
    with open("hello.txt", "r+b") as f:
        # memory-map the file, size 0 means whole file
        mm = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
        # read content via standard file methods
        print(mm.readline())  # prints b"Hello Python!\n"
        # read content via slice notation
        print(mm[:5])  # prints b"Hello"
        # update content using slice notation;
        # note that new content must have same size
        mm[6:] = b" world!\n"
        # ... and read again using standard file methods
        mm.seek(0)
        print(mm.readline())  # prints b"Hello  world!\n"
        # close the map
        mm.close()
    
`mmap` can also be used as a context manager in a `with` statement:

    
    import mmap
    
    with mmap.mmap(-1, 13) as mm:
        mm.write(b"Hello world!")
    
New in version 3.2: Context manager support.

The next example demonstrates how to create an anonymous map and exchange data
between the parent and child processes:

    
    import mmap
    import os
    
    mm = mmap.mmap(-1, 13)
    mm.write(b"Hello world!")
    
    pid = os.fork()
    
    if pid == 0:  # In a child process
        mm.seek(0)
        print(mm.readline())
    
        mm.close()
    
Raises an auditing event `mmap.__new__` with arguments `fileno`, `length`,
`access`, `offset`.

Memory-mapped file objects support the following methods:

`close()`

    
Closes the mmap. Subsequent calls to other methods of the object will result
in a ValueError exception being raised. This will not close the open file.

`closed`

    
`True` if the file is closed.

New in version 3.2.

`find(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Returns the lowest index in the object where the subsequence sub is found,
such that sub is contained in the range [start, end]. Optional arguments start
and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Returns `-1` on failure.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.

`flush([offset[, size]])`

    
Flushes changes made to the in-memory copy of a file back to disk. Without use
of this call there is no guarantee that changes are written back before the
object is destroyed. If offset and size are specified, only changes to the
given range of bytes will be flushed to disk; otherwise, the whole extent of
the mapping is flushed. offset must be a multiple of the `PAGESIZE` or
`ALLOCATIONGRANULARITY`.

`None` is returned to indicate success. An exception is raised when the call
failed.

Changed in version 3.8: Previously, a nonzero value was returned on success;
zero was returned on error under Windows. A zero value was returned on
success; an exception was raised on error under Unix.

`madvise(option[, start[, length]])`

    
Send advice option to the kernel about the memory region beginning at start
and extending length bytes. option must be one of the MADV_* constants
available on the system. If start and length are omitted, the entire mapping
is spanned. On some systems (including Linux), start must be a multiple of the
`PAGESIZE`.

Availability: Systems with the `madvise()` system call.

New in version 3.8.

`move(dest, src, count)`

    
Copy the count bytes starting at offset src to the destination index dest. If
the mmap was created with `ACCESS_READ`, then calls to move will raise a
`TypeError` exception.

`read([n])`

    
Return a `bytes` containing up to n bytes starting from the current file
position. If the argument is omitted, `None` or negative, return all bytes
from the current file position to the end of the mapping. The file position is
updated to point after the bytes that were returned.

Changed in version 3.3: Argument can be omitted or `None`.

`read_byte()`

    
Returns a byte at the current file position as an integer, and advances the
file position by 1.

`readline()`

    
Returns a single line, starting at the current file position and up to the
next newline. The file position is updated to point after the bytes that were
returned.

`resize(newsize)`

    
Resizes the map and the underlying file, if any. If the mmap was created with
`ACCESS_READ` or `ACCESS_COPY`, resizing the map will raise a `TypeError`
exception.

`rfind(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Returns the highest index in the object where the subsequence sub is found,
such that sub is contained in the range [start, end]. Optional arguments start
and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Returns `-1` on failure.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.

`seek(pos[, whence])`

    
Set the file’s current position. whence argument is optional and defaults to
`os.SEEK_SET` or `0` (absolute file positioning); other values are
`os.SEEK_CUR` or `1` (seek relative to the current position) and `os.SEEK_END`
or `2` (seek relative to the file’s end).

`size()`

    
Return the length of the file, which can be larger than the size of the
memory-mapped area.

`tell()`

    
Returns the current position of the file pointer.

`write(bytes)`

    
Write the bytes in bytes into memory at the current position of the file
pointer and return the number of bytes written (never less than `len(bytes)`,
since if the write fails, a `ValueError` will be raised). The file position is
updated to point after the bytes that were written. If the mmap was created
with `ACCESS_READ`, then writing to it will raise a `TypeError` exception.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.

Changed in version 3.6: The number of bytes written is now returned.

`write_byte(byte)`

    
Write the integer byte into memory at the current position of the file
pointer; the file position is advanced by `1`. If the mmap was created with
`ACCESS_READ`, then writing to it will raise a `TypeError` exception.
