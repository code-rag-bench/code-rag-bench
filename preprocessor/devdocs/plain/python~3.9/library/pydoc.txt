# pydoc — Documentation generator and online help system

Source code: Lib/pydoc.py

The `pydoc` module automatically generates documentation from Python modules.
The documentation can be presented as pages of text on the console, served to
a Web browser, or saved to HTML files.

For modules, classes, functions and methods, the displayed documentation is
derived from the docstring (i.e. the `__doc__` attribute) of the object, and
recursively of its documentable members. If there is no docstring, `pydoc`
tries to obtain a description from the block of comment lines just above the
definition of the class, function or method in the source file, or at the top
of the module (see `inspect.getcomments()`).

The built-in function `help()` invokes the online help system in the
interactive interpreter, which uses `pydoc` to generate its documentation as
text on the console. The same text documentation can also be viewed from
outside the Python interpreter by running pydoc as a script at the operating
system’s command prompt. For example, running

    
    pydoc sys
    
at a shell prompt will display documentation on the `sys` module, in a style
similar to the manual pages shown by the Unix man command. The argument to
pydoc can be the name of a function, module, or package, or a dotted reference
to a class, method, or function within a module or module in a package. If the
argument to pydoc looks like a path (that is, it contains the path separator
for your operating system, such as a slash in Unix), and refers to an existing
Python source file, then documentation is produced for that file.

Note

In order to find objects and their documentation, `pydoc` imports the
module(s) to be documented. Therefore, any code on module level will be
executed on that occasion. Use an `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard to only
execute code when a file is invoked as a script and not just imported.

When printing output to the console, pydoc attempts to paginate the output for
easier reading. If the `PAGER` environment variable is set, pydoc will use its
value as a pagination program.

Specifying a `-w` flag before the argument will cause HTML documentation to be
written out to a file in the current directory, instead of displaying text on
the console.

Specifying a `-k` flag before the argument will search the synopsis lines of
all available modules for the keyword given as the argument, again in a manner
similar to the Unix man command. The synopsis line of a module is the first
line of its documentation string.

You can also use pydoc to start an HTTP server on the local machine that will
serve documentation to visiting Web browsers. pydoc -p 1234 will start a HTTP
server on port 1234, allowing you to browse the documentation at
`http://localhost:1234/` in your preferred Web browser. Specifying `0` as the
port number will select an arbitrary unused port.

pydoc -n <hostname> will start the server listening at the given hostname. By
default the hostname is ‘localhost’ but if you want the server to be reached
from other machines, you may want to change the host name that the server
responds to. During development this is especially useful if you want to run
pydoc from within a container.

pydoc -b will start the server and additionally open a web browser to a module
index page. Each served page has a navigation bar at the top where you can Get
help on an individual item, Search all modules with a keyword in their
synopsis line, and go to the Module index, Topics and Keywords pages.

When pydoc generates documentation, it uses the current environment and path
to locate modules. Thus, invoking pydoc spam documents precisely the version
of the module you would get if you started the Python interpreter and typed
`import spam`.

Module docs for core modules are assumed to reside in
`https://docs.python.org/X.Y/library/` where `X` and `Y` are the major and
minor version numbers of the Python interpreter. This can be overridden by
setting the `PYTHONDOCS` environment variable to a different URL or to a local
directory containing the Library Reference Manual pages.

Changed in version 3.2: Added the `-b` option.

Changed in version 3.3: The `-g` command line option was removed.

Changed in version 3.4: `pydoc` now uses `inspect.signature()` rather than
`inspect.getfullargspec()` to extract signature information from callables.

Changed in version 3.7: Added the `-n` option.
