# binhex — Encode and decode binhex4 files

Source code: Lib/binhex.py

Deprecated since version 3.9.

This module encodes and decodes files in binhex4 format, a format allowing
representation of Macintosh files in ASCII. Only the data fork is handled.

The `binhex` module defines the following functions:

`binhex.binhex(input, output)`

    
Convert a binary file with filename input to binhex file output. The output
parameter can either be a filename or a file-like object (any object
supporting a `write()` and `close()` method).

`binhex.hexbin(input, output)`

    
Decode a binhex file input. input may be a filename or a file-like object
supporting `read()` and `close()` methods. The resulting file is written to a
file named output, unless the argument is `None` in which case the output
filename is read from the binhex file.

The following exception is also defined:

`exception binhex.Error`

    
Exception raised when something can’t be encoded using the binhex format (for
example, a filename is too long to fit in the filename field), or when input
is not properly encoded binhex data.

See also

`Module` `binascii`

    
Support module containing ASCII-to-binary and binary-to-ASCII conversions.

## Notes

There is an alternative, more powerful interface to the coder and decoder, see
the source for details.

If you code or decode textfiles on non-Macintosh platforms they will still use
the old Macintosh newline convention (carriage-return as end of line).
