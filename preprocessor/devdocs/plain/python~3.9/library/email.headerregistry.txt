# email.headerregistry: Custom Header Objects

Source code: Lib/email/headerregistry.py

New in version 3.6: 1

Headers are represented by customized subclasses of `str`. The particular
class used to represent a given header is determined by the `header_factory`
of the `policy` in effect when the headers are created. This section documents
the particular `header_factory` implemented by the email package for handling
RFC 5322 compliant email messages, which not only provides customized header
objects for various header types, but also provides an extension mechanism for
applications to add their own custom header types.

When using any of the policy objects derived from `EmailPolicy`, all headers
are produced by `HeaderRegistry` and have `BaseHeader` as their last base
class. Each header class has an additional base class that is determined by
the type of the header. For example, many headers have the class
`UnstructuredHeader` as their other base class. The specialized second class
for a header is determined by the name of the header, using a lookup table
stored in the `HeaderRegistry`. All of this is managed transparently for the
typical application program, but interfaces are provided for modifying the
default behavior for use by more complex applications.

The sections below first document the header base classes and their
attributes, followed by the API for modifying the behavior of
`HeaderRegistry`, and finally the support classes used to represent the data
parsed from structured headers.

`class email.headerregistry.BaseHeader(name, value)`

    
name and value are passed to `BaseHeader` from the `header_factory` call. The
string value of any header object is the value fully decoded to unicode.

This base class defines the following read-only properties:

`name`

    
The name of the header (the portion of the field before the ‘:’). This is
exactly the value passed in the `header_factory` call for name; that is, case
is preserved.

`defects`

    
A tuple of `HeaderDefect` instances reporting any RFC compliance problems
found during parsing. The email package tries to be complete about detecting
compliance issues. See the `errors` module for a discussion of the types of
defects that may be reported.

`max_count`

    
The maximum number of headers of this type that can have the same `name`. A
value of `None` means unlimited. The `BaseHeader` value for this attribute is
`None`; it is expected that specialized header classes will override this
value as needed.

`BaseHeader` also provides the following method, which is called by the email
library code and should not in general be called by application programs:

`fold(*, policy)`

    
Return a string containing `linesep` characters as required to correctly fold
the header according to policy. A `cte_type` of `8bit` will be treated as if
it were `7bit`, since headers may not contain arbitrary binary data. If `utf8`
is `False`, non-ASCII data will be RFC 2047 encoded.

`BaseHeader` by itself cannot be used to create a header object. It defines a
protocol that each specialized header cooperates with in order to produce the
header object. Specifically, `BaseHeader` requires that the specialized class
provide a `classmethod()` named `parse`. This method is called as follows:

    
    parse(string, kwds)
    
`kwds` is a dictionary containing one pre-initialized key, `defects`.
`defects` is an empty list. The parse method should append any detected
defects to this list. On return, the `kwds` dictionary must contain values for
at least the keys `decoded` and `defects`. `decoded` should be the string
value for the header (that is, the header value fully decoded to unicode). The
parse method should assume that string may contain content-transfer-encoded
parts, but should correctly handle all valid unicode characters as well so
that it can parse un-encoded header values.

`BaseHeader`’s `__new__` then creates the header instance, and calls its
`init` method. The specialized class only needs to provide an `init` method if
it wishes to set additional attributes beyond those provided by `BaseHeader`
itself. Such an `init` method should look like this:

    
    def init(self, /, *args, **kw):
        self._myattr = kw.pop('myattr')
        super().init(*args, **kw)
    
That is, anything extra that the specialized class puts in to the `kwds`
dictionary should be removed and handled, and the remaining contents of `kw`
(and `args`) passed to the `BaseHeader` `init` method.

`class email.headerregistry.UnstructuredHeader`

    
An “unstructured” header is the default type of header in RFC 5322. Any header
that does not have a specified syntax is treated as unstructured. The classic
example of an unstructured header is the Subject header.

In RFC 5322, an unstructured header is a run of arbitrary text in the ASCII
character set. RFC 2047, however, has an RFC 5322 compatible mechanism for
encoding non-ASCII text as ASCII characters within a header value. When a
value containing encoded words is passed to the constructor, the
`UnstructuredHeader` parser converts such encoded words into unicode,
following the RFC 2047 rules for unstructured text. The parser uses heuristics
to attempt to decode certain non-compliant encoded words. Defects are
registered in such cases, as well as defects for issues such as invalid
characters within the encoded words or the non-encoded text.

This header type provides no additional attributes.

`class email.headerregistry.DateHeader`

    
RFC 5322 specifies a very specific format for dates within email headers. The
`DateHeader` parser recognizes that date format, as well as recognizing a
number of variant forms that are sometimes found “in the wild”.

This header type provides the following additional attributes:

`datetime`

    
If the header value can be recognized as a valid date of one form or another,
this attribute will contain a `datetime` instance representing that date. If
the timezone of the input date is specified as `-0000` (indicating it is in
UTC but contains no information about the source timezone), then `datetime`
will be a naive `datetime`. If a specific timezone offset is found (including
`+0000`), then `datetime` will contain an aware `datetime` that uses
`datetime.timezone` to record the timezone offset.

The `decoded` value of the header is determined by formatting the `datetime`
according to the RFC 5322 rules; that is, it is set to:

    
    email.utils.format_datetime(self.datetime)
    
When creating a `DateHeader`, value may be `datetime` instance. This means,
for example, that the following code is valid and does what one would expect:

    
    msg['Date'] = datetime(2011, 7, 15, 21)
    
Because this is a naive `datetime` it will be interpreted as a UTC timestamp,
and the resulting value will have a timezone of `-0000`. Much more useful is
to use the `localtime()` function from the `utils` module:

    
    msg['Date'] = utils.localtime()
    
This example sets the date header to the current time and date using the
current timezone offset.

`class email.headerregistry.AddressHeader`

    
Address headers are one of the most complex structured header types. The
`AddressHeader` class provides a generic interface to any address header.

This header type provides the following additional attributes:

`groups`

    
A tuple of `Group` objects encoding the addresses and groups found in the
header value. Addresses that are not part of a group are represented in this
list as single-address `Groups` whose `display_name` is `None`.

`addresses`

    
A tuple of `Address` objects encoding all of the individual addresses from the
header value. If the header value contains any groups, the individual
addresses from the group are included in the list at the point where the group
occurs in the value (that is, the list of addresses is “flattened” into a one
dimensional list).

The `decoded` value of the header will have all encoded words decoded to
unicode. `idna` encoded domain names are also decoded to unicode. The
`decoded` value is set by `join`ing the `str` value of the elements of the
`groups` attribute with `', '`.

A list of `Address` and `Group` objects in any combination may be used to set
the value of an address header. `Group` objects whose `display_name` is `None`
will be interpreted as single addresses, which allows an address list to be
copied with groups intact by using the list obtained from the `groups`
attribute of the source header.

`class email.headerregistry.SingleAddressHeader`

    
A subclass of `AddressHeader` that adds one additional attribute:

`address`

    
The single address encoded by the header value. If the header value actually
contains more than one address (which would be a violation of the RFC under
the default `policy`), accessing this attribute will result in a `ValueError`.

Many of the above classes also have a `Unique` variant (for example,
`UniqueUnstructuredHeader`). The only difference is that in the `Unique`
variant, `max_count` is set to 1.

`class email.headerregistry.MIMEVersionHeader`

    
There is really only one valid value for the MIME-Version header, and that is
`1.0`. For future proofing, this header class supports other valid version
numbers. If a version number has a valid value per RFC 2045, then the header
object will have non-`None` values for the following attributes:

`version`

    
The version number as a string, with any whitespace and/or comments removed.

`major`

    
The major version number as an integer

`minor`

    
The minor version number as an integer

`class email.headerregistry.ParameterizedMIMEHeader`

    
MIME headers all start with the prefix ‘Content-‘. Each specific header has a
certain value, described under the class for that header. Some can also take a
list of supplemental parameters, which have a common format. This class serves
as a base for all the MIME headers that take parameters.

`params`

    
A dictionary mapping parameter names to parameter values.

`class email.headerregistry.ContentTypeHeader`

    
A `ParameterizedMIMEHeader` class that handles the Content-Type header.

`content_type`

    
The content type string, in the form `maintype/subtype`.

`maintype`

`subtype`

`class email.headerregistry.ContentDispositionHeader`

    
A `ParameterizedMIMEHeader` class that handles the Content-Disposition header.

`content_disposition`

    
`inline` and `attachment` are the only valid values in common use.

`class email.headerregistry.ContentTransferEncoding`

    
Handles the Content-Transfer-Encoding header.

`cte`

    
Valid values are `7bit`, `8bit`, `base64`, and `quoted-printable`. See RFC
2045 for more information.

`class email.headerregistry.HeaderRegistry(base_class=BaseHeader,
default_class=UnstructuredHeader, use_default_map=True)`

    
This is the factory used by `EmailPolicy` by default. `HeaderRegistry` builds
the class used to create a header instance dynamically, using base_class and a
specialized class retrieved from a registry that it holds. When a given header
name does not appear in the registry, the class specified by default_class is
used as the specialized class. When use_default_map is `True` (the default),
the standard mapping of header names to classes is copied in to the registry
during initialization. base_class is always the last class in the generated
class’s `__bases__` list.

The default mappings are:

subject

    
UniqueUnstructuredHeader

date

    
UniqueDateHeader

resent-date

    
DateHeader

orig-date

    
UniqueDateHeader

sender

    
UniqueSingleAddressHeader

resent-sender

    
SingleAddressHeader

to

    
UniqueAddressHeader

resent-to

    
AddressHeader

cc

    
UniqueAddressHeader

resent-cc

    
AddressHeader

bcc

    
UniqueAddressHeader

resent-bcc

    
AddressHeader

from

    
UniqueAddressHeader

resent-from

    
AddressHeader

reply-to

    
UniqueAddressHeader

mime-version

    
MIMEVersionHeader

content-type

    
ContentTypeHeader

content-disposition

    
ContentDispositionHeader

content-transfer-encoding

    
ContentTransferEncodingHeader

message-id

    
MessageIDHeader

`HeaderRegistry` has the following methods:

`map_to_type(self, name, cls)`

    
name is the name of the header to be mapped. It will be converted to lower
case in the registry. cls is the specialized class to be used, along with
base_class, to create the class used to instantiate headers that match name.

`__getitem__(name)`

    
Construct and return a class to handle creating a name header.

`__call__(name, value)`

    
Retrieves the specialized header associated with name from the registry (using
default_class if name does not appear in the registry) and composes it with
base_class to produce a class, calls the constructed class’s constructor,
passing it the same argument list, and finally returns the class instance
created thereby.

The following classes are the classes used to represent data parsed from
structured headers and can, in general, be used by an application program to
construct structured values to assign to specific headers.

`class email.headerregistry.Address(display_name='', username='', domain='',
addr_spec=None)`

    
The class used to represent an email address. The general form of an address
is:

    
    [display_name] <username@domain>
    
or:

    
    username@domain
    
where each part must conform to specific syntax rules spelled out in RFC 5322.

As a convenience addr_spec can be specified instead of username and domain, in
which case username and domain will be parsed from the addr_spec. An addr_spec
must be a properly RFC quoted string; if it is not `Address` will raise an
error. Unicode characters are allowed and will be property encoded when
serialized. However, per the RFCs, unicode is not allowed in the username
portion of the address.

`display_name`

    
The display name portion of the address, if any, with all quoting removed. If
the address does not have a display name, this attribute will be an empty
string.

`username`

    
The `username` portion of the address, with all quoting removed.

`domain`

    
The `domain` portion of the address.

`addr_spec`

    
The `username@domain` portion of the address, correctly quoted for use as a
bare address (the second form shown above). This attribute is not mutable.

`__str__()`

    
The `str` value of the object is the address quoted according to RFC 5322
rules, but with no Content Transfer Encoding of any non-ASCII characters.

To support SMTP (RFC 5321), `Address` handles one special case: if `username`
and `domain` are both the empty string (or `None`), then the string value of
the `Address` is `<>`.

`class email.headerregistry.Group(display_name=None, addresses=None)`

    
The class used to represent an address group. The general form of an address
group is:

    
    display_name: [address-list];
    
As a convenience for processing lists of addresses that consist of a mixture
of groups and single addresses, a `Group` may also be used to represent single
addresses that are not part of a group by setting display_name to `None` and
providing a list of the single address as addresses.

`display_name`

    
The `display_name` of the group. If it is `None` and there is exactly one
`Address` in `addresses`, then the `Group` represents a single address that is
not in a group.

`addresses`

    
A possibly empty tuple of `Address` objects representing the addresses in the
group.

`__str__()`

    
The `str` value of a `Group` is formatted according to RFC 5322, but with no
Content Transfer Encoding of any non-ASCII characters. If `display_name` is
none and there is a single `Address` in the `addresses` list, the `str` value
will be the same as the `str` of that single `Address`.
