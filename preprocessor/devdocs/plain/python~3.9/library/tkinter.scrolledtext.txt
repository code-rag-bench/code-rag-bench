# tkinter.scrolledtext — Scrolled Text Widget

Source code: Lib/tkinter/scrolledtext.py

The `tkinter.scrolledtext` module provides a class of the same name which
implements a basic text widget which has a vertical scroll bar configured to
do the “right thing.” Using the `ScrolledText` class is a lot easier than
setting up a text widget and scroll bar directly.

The text widget and scrollbar are packed together in a `Frame`, and the
methods of the `Grid` and `Pack` geometry managers are acquired from the
`Frame` object. This allows the `ScrolledText` widget to be used directly to
achieve most normal geometry management behavior.

Should more specific control be necessary, the following attributes are
available:

`class tkinter.scrolledtext.ScrolledText(master=None, **kw)`

    
`frame`

    
The frame which surrounds the text and scroll bar widgets.

`vbar`

    
The scroll bar widget.
