# email.encoders: Encoders

Source code: Lib/email/encoders.py

This module is part of the legacy (`Compat32`) email API. In the new API the
functionality is provided by the cte parameter of the `set_content()` method.

This module is deprecated in Python 3. The functions provided here should not
be called explicitly since the `MIMEText` class sets the content type and CTE
header using the _subtype and _charset values passed during the instantiation
of that class.

The remaining text in this section is the original documentation of the
module.

When creating `Message` objects from scratch, you often need to encode the
payloads for transport through compliant mail servers. This is especially true
for image/* and text/* type messages containing binary data.

The `email` package provides some convenient encoders in its `encoders`
module. These encoders are actually used by the `MIMEAudio` and `MIMEImage`
class constructors to provide default encodings. All encoder functions take
exactly one argument, the message object to encode. They usually extract the
payload, encode it, and reset the payload to this newly encoded value. They
should also set the Content-Transfer-Encoding header as appropriate.

Note that these functions are not meaningful for a multipart message. They
must be applied to individual subparts instead, and will raise a `TypeError`
if passed a message whose type is multipart.

Here are the encoding functions provided:

`email.encoders.encode_quopri(msg)`

    
Encodes the payload into quoted-printable form and sets the Content-Transfer-
Encoding header to `quoted-printable` 1. This is a good encoding to use when
most of your payload is normal printable data, but contains a few unprintable
characters.

`email.encoders.encode_base64(msg)`

    
Encodes the payload into base64 form and sets the Content-Transfer-Encoding
header to `base64`. This is a good encoding to use when most of your payload
is unprintable data since it is a more compact form than quoted-printable. The
drawback of base64 encoding is that it renders the text non-human readable.

`email.encoders.encode_7or8bit(msg)`

    
This doesn’t actually modify the message’s payload, but it does set the
Content-Transfer-Encoding header to either `7bit` or `8bit` as appropriate,
based on the payload data.

`email.encoders.encode_noop(msg)`

    
This does nothing; it doesn’t even set the Content-Transfer-Encoding header.

#### Footnotes

`1`

    
Note that encoding with `encode_quopri()` also encodes all tabs and space
characters in the data.
