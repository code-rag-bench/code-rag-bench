# venv — Creation of virtual environments

New in version 3.3.

Source code: Lib/venv/

The `venv` module provides support for creating lightweight “virtual
environments” with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system
site directories. Each virtual environment has its own Python binary (which
matches the version of the binary that was used to create this environment)
and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site
directories.

See PEP 405 for more information about Python virtual environments.

Python Packaging User Guide: Creating and using virtual environments

## Creating virtual environments

Creation of virtual environments is done by executing the command `venv`:

    
    python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
    
Running this command creates the target directory (creating any parent
directories that don’t exist already) and places a `pyvenv.cfg` file in it
with a `home` key pointing to the Python installation from which the command
was run (a common name for the target directory is `.venv`). It also creates a
`bin` (or `Scripts` on Windows) subdirectory containing a copy/symlink of the
Python binary/binaries (as appropriate for the platform or arguments used at
environment creation time). It also creates an (initially empty)
`lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` subdirectory (on Windows, this is `Lib\site-
packages`). If an existing directory is specified, it will be re-used.

Deprecated since version 3.6: `pyvenv` was the recommended tool for creating
virtual environments for Python 3.3 and 3.4, and is deprecated in Python 3.6.

Changed in version 3.5: The use of `venv` is now recommended for creating
virtual environments.

On Windows, invoke the `venv` command as follows:

    
    c:\>c:\Python35\python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv
    
Alternatively, if you configured the `PATH` and `PATHEXT` variables for your
Python installation:

    
    c:\>python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv
    
The command, if run with `-h`, will show the available options:

    
    usage: venv [-h] [--system-site-packages] [--symlinks | --copies] [--clear]
                [--upgrade] [--without-pip] [--prompt PROMPT] [--upgrade-deps]
                ENV_DIR [ENV_DIR ...]
    
    Creates virtual Python environments in one or more target directories.
    
    positional arguments:
      ENV_DIR               A directory to create the environment in.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --system-site-packages
                            Give the virtual environment access to the system
                            site-packages dir.
      --symlinks            Try to use symlinks rather than copies, when symlinks
                            are not the default for the platform.
      --copies              Try to use copies rather than symlinks, even when
                            symlinks are the default for the platform.
      --clear               Delete the contents of the environment directory if it
                            already exists, before environment creation.
      --upgrade             Upgrade the environment directory to use this version
                            of Python, assuming Python has been upgraded in-place.
      --without-pip         Skips installing or upgrading pip in the virtual
                            environment (pip is bootstrapped by default)
      --prompt PROMPT       Provides an alternative prompt prefix for this
                            environment.
      --upgrade-deps        Upgrade core dependencies: pip setuptools to the
                            latest version in PyPI
    
    Once an environment has been created, you may wish to activate it, e.g. by
    sourcing an activate script in its bin directory.
    
Changed in version 3.9: Add `--upgrade-deps` option to upgrade pip +
setuptools to the latest on PyPI

Changed in version 3.4: Installs pip by default, added the `--without-pip` and
`--copies` options

Changed in version 3.4: In earlier versions, if the target directory already
existed, an error was raised, unless the `--clear` or `--upgrade` option was
provided.

Note

While symlinks are supported on Windows, they are not recommended. Of
particular note is that double-clicking `python.exe` in File Explorer will
resolve the symlink eagerly and ignore the virtual environment.

Note

On Microsoft Windows, it may be required to enable the `Activate.ps1` script
by setting the execution policy for the user. You can do this by issuing the
following PowerShell command:

PS C:> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

See About Execution Policies for more information.

The created `pyvenv.cfg` file also includes the `include-system-site-packages`
key, set to `true` if `venv` is run with the `--system-site-packages` option,
`false` otherwise.

Unless the `--without-pip` option is given, `ensurepip` will be invoked to
bootstrap `pip` into the virtual environment.

Multiple paths can be given to `venv`, in which case an identical virtual
environment will be created, according to the given options, at each provided
path.

Once a virtual environment has been created, it can be “activated” using a
script in the virtual environment’s binary directory. The invocation of the
script is platform-specific (`<venv>` must be replaced by the path of the
directory containing the virtual environment):

Platform | Shell | Command to activate virtual environment  
---|---|---  
POSIX | bash/zsh | $ source <venv>/bin/activate  
| fish | $ source <venv>/bin/activate.fish  
| csh/tcsh | $ source <venv>/bin/activate.csh  
| PowerShell Core | $ <venv>/bin/Activate.ps1  
Windows | cmd.exe | C:\> <venv>\Scripts\activate.bat  
| PowerShell | PS C:\> <venv>\Scripts\Activate.ps1  
When a virtual environment is active, the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable
is set to the path of the virtual environment. This can be used to check if
one is running inside a virtual environment.

You don’t specifically need to activate an environment; activation just
prepends the virtual environment’s binary directory to your path, so that
“python” invokes the virtual environment’s Python interpreter and you can run
installed scripts without having to use their full path. However, all scripts
installed in a virtual environment should be runnable without activating it,
and run with the virtual environment’s Python automatically.

You can deactivate a virtual environment by typing “deactivate” in your shell.
The exact mechanism is platform-specific and is an internal implementation
detail (typically a script or shell function will be used).

New in version 3.4: `fish` and `csh` activation scripts.

New in version 3.8: PowerShell activation scripts installed under POSIX for
PowerShell Core support.

Note

A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python
interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those
installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries
installed in a “system” Python, i.e., one which is installed as part of your
operating system.

A virtual environment is a directory tree which contains Python executable
files and other files which indicate that it is a virtual environment.

Common installation tools such as setuptools and pip work as expected with
virtual environments. In other words, when a virtual environment is active,
they install Python packages into the virtual environment without needing to
be told to do so explicitly.

When a virtual environment is active (i.e., the virtual environment’s Python
interpreter is running), the attributes `sys.prefix` and `sys.exec_prefix`
point to the base directory of the virtual environment, whereas
`sys.base_prefix` and `sys.base_exec_prefix` point to the non-virtual
environment Python installation which was used to create the virtual
environment. If a virtual environment is not active, then `sys.prefix` is the
same as `sys.base_prefix` and `sys.exec_prefix` is the same as
`sys.base_exec_prefix` (they all point to a non-virtual environment Python
installation).

When a virtual environment is active, any options that change the installation
path will be ignored from all `distutils` configuration files to prevent
projects being inadvertently installed outside of the virtual environment.

When working in a command shell, users can make a virtual environment active
by running an `activate` script in the virtual environment’s executables
directory (the precise filename and command to use the file is shell-
dependent), which prepends the virtual environment’s directory for executables
to the `PATH` environment variable for the running shell. There should be no
need in other circumstances to activate a virtual environment; scripts
installed into virtual environments have a “shebang” line which points to the
virtual environment’s Python interpreter. This means that the script will run
with that interpreter regardless of the value of `PATH`. On Windows, “shebang”
line processing is supported if you have the Python Launcher for Windows
installed (this was added to Python in 3.3 - see PEP 397 for more details).
Thus, double-clicking an installed script in a Windows Explorer window should
run the script with the correct interpreter without there needing to be any
reference to its virtual environment in `PATH`.

## API

The high-level method described above makes use of a simple API which provides
mechanisms for third-party virtual environment creators to customize
environment creation according to their needs, the `EnvBuilder` class.

`class venv.EnvBuilder(system_site_packages=False, clear=False,
symlinks=False, upgrade=False, with_pip=False, prompt=None,
upgrade_deps=False)`

    
The `EnvBuilder` class accepts the following keyword arguments on
instantiation:

  * `system_site_packages` – a Boolean value indicating that the system Python site-packages should be available to the environment (defaults to `False`).
  * `clear` – a Boolean value which, if true, will delete the contents of any existing target directory, before creating the environment.
  * `symlinks` – a Boolean value indicating whether to attempt to symlink the Python binary rather than copying.
  * `upgrade` – a Boolean value which, if true, will upgrade an existing environment with the running Python - for use when that Python has been upgraded in-place (defaults to `False`).
  * `with_pip` – a Boolean value which, if true, ensures pip is installed in the virtual environment. This uses `ensurepip` with the `--default-pip` option.
  * `prompt` – a String to be used after virtual environment is activated (defaults to `None` which means directory name of the environment would be used). If the special string `"."` is provided, the basename of the current directory is used as the prompt.
  * `upgrade_deps` – Update the base venv modules to the latest on PyPI

Changed in version 3.4: Added the `with_pip` parameter

New in version 3.6: Added the `prompt` parameter

New in version 3.9: Added the `upgrade_deps` parameter

Creators of third-party virtual environment tools will be free to use the
provided `EnvBuilder` class as a base class.

The returned env-builder is an object which has a method, `create`:

`create(env_dir)`

    
Create a virtual environment by specifying the target directory (absolute or
relative to the current directory) which is to contain the virtual
environment. The `create` method will either create the environment in the
specified directory, or raise an appropriate exception.

The `create` method of the `EnvBuilder` class illustrates the hooks available
for subclass customization:

    
    def create(self, env_dir):
        """
        Create a virtualized Python environment in a directory.
        env_dir is the target directory to create an environment in.
        """
        env_dir = os.path.abspath(env_dir)
        context = self.ensure_directories(env_dir)
        self.create_configuration(context)
        self.setup_python(context)
        self.setup_scripts(context)
        self.post_setup(context)
    
Each of the methods `ensure_directories()`, `create_configuration()`,
`setup_python()`, `setup_scripts()` and `post_setup()` can be overridden.

`ensure_directories(env_dir)`

    
Creates the environment directory and all necessary directories, and returns a
context object. This is just a holder for attributes (such as paths), for use
by the other methods. The directories are allowed to exist already, as long as
either `clear` or `upgrade` were specified to allow operating on an existing
environment directory.

`create_configuration(context)`

    
Creates the `pyvenv.cfg` configuration file in the environment.

`setup_python(context)`

    
Creates a copy or symlink to the Python executable in the environment. On
POSIX systems, if a specific executable `python3.x` was used, symlinks to
`python` and `python3` will be created pointing to that executable, unless
files with those names already exist.

`setup_scripts(context)`

    
Installs activation scripts appropriate to the platform into the virtual
environment.

`upgrade_dependencies(context)`

    
Upgrades the core venv dependency packages (currently `pip` and `setuptools`)
in the environment. This is done by shelling out to the `pip` executable in
the environment.

New in version 3.9.

`post_setup(context)`

    
A placeholder method which can be overridden in third party implementations to
pre-install packages in the virtual environment or perform other post-creation
steps.

Changed in version 3.7.2: Windows now uses redirector scripts for
`python[w].exe` instead of copying the actual binaries. In 3.7.2 only
`setup_python()` does nothing unless running from a build in the source tree.

Changed in version 3.7.3: Windows copies the redirector scripts as part of
`setup_python()` instead of `setup_scripts()`. This was not the case in 3.7.2.
When using symlinks, the original executables will be linked.

In addition, `EnvBuilder` provides this utility method that can be called from
`setup_scripts()` or `post_setup()` in subclasses to assist in installing
custom scripts into the virtual environment.

`install_scripts(context, path)`

    
path is the path to a directory that should contain subdirectories “common”,
“posix”, “nt”, each containing scripts destined for the bin directory in the
environment. The contents of “common” and the directory corresponding to
`os.name` are copied after some text replacement of placeholders:

  * `__VENV_DIR__` is replaced with the absolute path of the environment directory.
  * `__VENV_NAME__` is replaced with the environment name (final path segment of environment directory).
  * `__VENV_PROMPT__` is replaced with the prompt (the environment name surrounded by parentheses and with a following space)
  * `__VENV_BIN_NAME__` is replaced with the name of the bin directory (either `bin` or `Scripts`).
  * `__VENV_PYTHON__` is replaced with the absolute path of the environment’s executable.

The directories are allowed to exist (for when an existing environment is
being upgraded).

There is also a module-level convenience function:

`venv.create(env_dir, system_site_packages=False, clear=False, symlinks=False,
with_pip=False, prompt=None)`

    
Create an `EnvBuilder` with the given keyword arguments, and call its
`create()` method with the env_dir argument.

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.4: Added the `with_pip` parameter

Changed in version 3.6: Added the `prompt` parameter

## An example of extending `EnvBuilder`

The following script shows how to extend `EnvBuilder` by implementing a
subclass which installs setuptools and pip into a created virtual environment:

    
    import os
    import os.path
    from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
    import sys
    from threading import Thread
    from urllib.parse import urlparse
    from urllib.request import urlretrieve
    import venv
    
    class ExtendedEnvBuilder(venv.EnvBuilder):
        """
        This builder installs setuptools and pip so that you can pip or
        easy_install other packages into the created virtual environment.
    
        :param nodist: If true, setuptools and pip are not installed into the
                       created virtual environment.
        :param nopip: If true, pip is not installed into the created
                      virtual environment.
        :param progress: If setuptools or pip are installed, the progress of the
                         installation can be monitored by passing a progress
                         callable. If specified, it is called with two
                         arguments: a string indicating some progress, and a
                         context indicating where the string is coming from.
                         The context argument can have one of three values:
                         'main', indicating that it is called from virtualize()
                         itself, and 'stdout' and 'stderr', which are obtained
                         by reading lines from the output streams of a subprocess
                         which is used to install the app.
    
                         If a callable is not specified, default progress
