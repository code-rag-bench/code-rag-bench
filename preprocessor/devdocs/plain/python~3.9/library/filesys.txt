# File and Directory Access

The modules described in this chapter deal with disk files and directories.
For example, there are modules for reading the properties of files,
manipulating paths in a portable way, and creating temporary files. The full
list of modules in this chapter is:

  * `pathlib` — Object-oriented filesystem paths
    * Basic use
    * Pure paths
      * General properties
      * Operators
      * Accessing individual parts
      * Methods and properties
    * Concrete paths
      * Methods
    * Correspondence to tools in the `os` module
  * `os.path` — Common pathname manipulations
  * `fileinput` — Iterate over lines from multiple input streams
  * `stat` — Interpreting `stat()` results
  * `filecmp` — File and Directory Comparisons
    * The `dircmp` class
  * `tempfile` — Generate temporary files and directories
    * Examples
    * Deprecated functions and variables
  * `glob` — Unix style pathname pattern expansion
  * `fnmatch` — Unix filename pattern matching
  * `linecache` — Random access to text lines
  * `shutil` — High-level file operations
    * Directory and files operations
      * Platform-dependent efficient copy operations
      * copytree example
      * rmtree example
    * Archiving operations
      * Archiving example
      * Archiving example with base_dir
    * Querying the size of the output terminal
