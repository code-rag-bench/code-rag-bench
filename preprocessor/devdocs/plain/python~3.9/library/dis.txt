# dis — Disassembler for Python bytecode

Source code: Lib/dis.py

The `dis` module supports the analysis of CPython bytecode by disassembling
it. The CPython bytecode which this module takes as an input is defined in the
file `Include/opcode.h` and used by the compiler and the interpreter.

CPython implementation detail: Bytecode is an implementation detail of the
CPython interpreter. No guarantees are made that bytecode will not be added,
removed, or changed between versions of Python. Use of this module should not
be considered to work across Python VMs or Python releases.

Changed in version 3.6: Use 2 bytes for each instruction. Previously the
number of bytes varied by instruction.

Example: Given the function `myfunc()`:

    
    def myfunc(alist):
        return len(alist)
    
the following command can be used to display the disassembly of `myfunc()`:

    
    >>> dis.dis(myfunc)
      2           0 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (len)
                  2 LOAD_FAST                0 (alist)
                  4 CALL_FUNCTION            1
                  6 RETURN_VALUE
    
(The “2” is a line number).

## Bytecode analysis

New in version 3.4.

The bytecode analysis API allows pieces of Python code to be wrapped in a
`Bytecode` object that provides easy access to details of the compiled code.

`class dis.Bytecode(x, *, first_line=None, current_offset=None)`

    
Analyse the bytecode corresponding to a function, generator, asynchronous
generator, coroutine, method, string of source code, or a code object (as
returned by `compile()`).

This is a convenience wrapper around many of the functions listed below, most
notably `get_instructions()`, as iterating over a `Bytecode` instance yields
the bytecode operations as `Instruction` instances.

If first_line is not `None`, it indicates the line number that should be
reported for the first source line in the disassembled code. Otherwise, the
source line information (if any) is taken directly from the disassembled code
object.

If current_offset is not `None`, it refers to an instruction offset in the
disassembled code. Setting this means `dis()` will display a “current
instruction” marker against the specified opcode.

`classmethod from_traceback(tb)`

    
Construct a `Bytecode` instance from the given traceback, setting
current_offset to the instruction responsible for the exception.

`codeobj`

    
The compiled code object.

`first_line`

    
The first source line of the code object (if available)

`dis()`

    
Return a formatted view of the bytecode operations (the same as printed by
`dis.dis()`, but returned as a multi-line string).

`info()`

    
Return a formatted multi-line string with detailed information about the code
object, like `code_info()`.

Changed in version 3.7: This can now handle coroutine and asynchronous
generator objects.

Example:

    
    >>> bytecode = dis.Bytecode(myfunc)
    >>> for instr in bytecode:
    ...     print(instr.opname)
    ...
    LOAD_GLOBAL
    LOAD_FAST
    CALL_FUNCTION
    RETURN_VALUE
    
## Analysis functions

The `dis` module also defines the following analysis functions that convert
the input directly to the desired output. They can be useful if only a single
operation is being performed, so the intermediate analysis object isn’t
useful:

`dis.code_info(x)`

    
Return a formatted multi-line string with detailed code object information for
the supplied function, generator, asynchronous generator, coroutine, method,
source code string or code object.

Note that the exact contents of code info strings are highly implementation
dependent and they may change arbitrarily across Python VMs or Python
releases.

New in version 3.2.

Changed in version 3.7: This can now handle coroutine and asynchronous
generator objects.

`dis.show_code(x, *, file=None)`

    
Print detailed code object information for the supplied function, method,
source code string or code object to file (or `sys.stdout` if file is not
specified).

This is a convenient shorthand for `print(code_info(x), file=file)`, intended
for interactive exploration at the interpreter prompt.

New in version 3.2.

Changed in version 3.4: Added file parameter.

`dis.dis(x=None, *, file=None, depth=None)`

    
Disassemble the x object. x can denote either a module, a class, a method, a
function, a generator, an asynchronous generator, a coroutine, a code object,
a string of source code or a byte sequence of raw bytecode. For a module, it
disassembles all functions. For a class, it disassembles all methods
(including class and static methods). For a code object or sequence of raw
bytecode, it prints one line per bytecode instruction. It also recursively
disassembles nested code objects (the code of comprehensions, generator
expressions and nested functions, and the code used for building nested
classes). Strings are first compiled to code objects with the `compile()`
built-in function before being disassembled. If no object is provided, this
function disassembles the last traceback.

The disassembly is written as text to the supplied file argument if provided
and to `sys.stdout` otherwise.

The maximal depth of recursion is limited by depth unless it is `None`.
`depth=0` means no recursion.

Changed in version 3.4: Added file parameter.

Changed in version 3.7: Implemented recursive disassembling and added depth
parameter.

Changed in version 3.7: This can now handle coroutine and asynchronous
generator objects.

`dis.distb(tb=None, *, file=None)`

    
Disassemble the top-of-stack function of a traceback, using the last traceback
if none was passed. The instruction causing the exception is indicated.

The disassembly is written as text to the supplied file argument if provided
and to `sys.stdout` otherwise.

Changed in version 3.4: Added file parameter.

`dis.disassemble(code, lasti=-1, *, file=None)`

`dis.disco(code, lasti=-1, *, file=None)`

    
Disassemble a code object, indicating the last instruction if lasti was
provided. The output is divided in the following columns:

  1. the line number, for the first instruction of each line
  2. the current instruction, indicated as `-->`,
  3. a labelled instruction, indicated with `>>`,
  4. the address of the instruction,
  5. the operation code name,
  6. operation parameters, and
  7. interpretation of the parameters in parentheses.

The parameter interpretation recognizes local and global variable names,
constant values, branch targets, and compare operators.

The disassembly is written as text to the supplied file argument if provided
and to `sys.stdout` otherwise.

Changed in version 3.4: Added file parameter.

`dis.get_instructions(x, *, first_line=None)`

    
Return an iterator over the instructions in the supplied function, method,
source code string or code object.

The iterator generates a series of `Instruction` named tuples giving the
details of each operation in the supplied code.

If first_line is not `None`, it indicates the line number that should be
reported for the first source line in the disassembled code. Otherwise, the
source line information (if any) is taken directly from the disassembled code
object.

New in version 3.4.

`dis.findlinestarts(code)`

    
This generator function uses the `co_firstlineno` and `co_lnotab` attributes
of the code object code to find the offsets which are starts of lines in the
source code. They are generated as `(offset, lineno)` pairs. See
Objects/lnotab_notes.txt for the `co_lnotab` format and how to decode it.

Changed in version 3.6: Line numbers can be decreasing. Before, they were
always increasing.

`dis.findlabels(code)`

    
Detect all offsets in the raw compiled bytecode string code which are jump
targets, and return a list of these offsets.

`dis.stack_effect(opcode, oparg=None, *, jump=None)`

    
Compute the stack effect of opcode with argument oparg.

If the code has a jump target and jump is `True`, `stack_effect()` will return
the stack effect of jumping. If jump is `False`, it will return the stack
effect of not jumping. And if jump is `None` (default), it will return the
maximal stack effect of both cases.

New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.8: Added jump parameter.

Unary operations

Unary operations take the top of the stack, apply the operation, and push the
result back on the stack.

`UNARY_POSITIVE`

Binary operations

Binary operations remove the top of the stack (TOS) and the second top-most
stack item (TOS1) from the stack. They perform the operation, and put the
result back on the stack.

`BINARY_OR`

    
Implements `TOS = TOS1 | TOS`.
In-place operations

In-place operations are like binary operations, in that they remove TOS and
TOS1, and push the result back on the stack, but the operation is done in-
place when TOS1 supports it, and the resulting TOS may be (but does not have
to be) the original TOS1.

`INPLACE_POWER`

`INPLACE_MULTIPLY`

    
Implements in-place `TOS = TOS1 * TOS`.

`DELETE_SUBSCR`

    
Implements `del TOS1[TOS]`.

Coroutine opcodes

`GET_AWAITABLE`

    
Implements `TOS = get_awaitable(TOS)`, where `get_awaitable(o)` returns `o` if
`o` is a coroutine object or a generator object with the CO_ITERABLE_COROUTINE
flag, or resolves `o.__await__`.

New in version 3.5.

`GET_AITER`

    
Implements `TOS = TOS.__aiter__()`.

New in version 3.5.

Changed in version 3.7: Returning awaitable objects from `__aiter__` is no
longer supported.

Implements `PUSH(get_awaitable(TOS.__anext__()))`. See `GET_AWAITABLE` for
details about `get_awaitable`

New in version 3.5.

`END_ASYNC_FOR`

    
Terminates an `async for` loop. Handles an exception raised when awaiting a
next item. If TOS is `StopAsyncIteration` pop 7 values from the stack and
restore the exception state using the second three of them. Otherwise re-raise
the exception using the three values from the stack. An exception handler
block is removed from the block stack.

New in version 3.8.

`BEFORE_ASYNC_WITH`

    
Resolves `__aenter__` and `__aexit__` from the object on top of the stack.
Pushes `__aexit__` and result of `__aenter__()` to the stack.

New in version 3.5.

`SETUP_ASYNC_WITH`

    
Creates a new frame object.

New in version 3.5.

Miscellaneous opcodes

`PRINT_EXPR`

    
Implements the expression statement for the interactive mode. TOS is removed
from the stack and printed. In non-interactive mode, an expression statement
is terminated with `POP_TOP`.

`SET_ADD(i)`

    
Calls `set.add(TOS1[-i], TOS)`. Used to implement set comprehensions.

`LIST_APPEND(i)`

    
Calls `list.append(TOS1[-i], TOS)`. Used to implement list comprehensions.

`MAP_ADD(i)`

    
Calls `dict.__setitem__(TOS1[-i], TOS1, TOS)`. Used to implement dict
comprehensions.

New in version 3.1.

Changed in version 3.8: Map value is TOS and map key is TOS1. Before, those
were reversed.

For all of the `SET_ADD`, `LIST_APPEND` and `MAP_ADD` instructions, while the
added value or key/value pair is popped off, the container object remains on
the stack so that it is available for further iterations of the loop.

`RETURN_VALUE`

    
Returns with TOS to the caller of the function.

`YIELD_VALUE`

    
Pops TOS and yields it from a generator.

`YIELD_FROM`

    
Pops TOS and delegates to it as a subiterator from a generator.

New in version 3.3.

`SETUP_ANNOTATIONS`

    
Checks whether `__annotations__` is defined in `locals()`, if not it is set up
to an empty `dict`. This opcode is only emitted if a class or module body
contains variable annotations statically.

New in version 3.6.

`IMPORT_STAR`

    
Loads all symbols not starting with `'_'` directly from the module TOS to the
local namespace. The module is popped after loading all names. This opcode
implements `from module import *`.

`POP_BLOCK`

    
Removes one block from the block stack. Per frame, there is a stack of blocks,
denoting `try` statements, and such.

`POP_EXCEPT`

    
Removes one block from the block stack. The popped block must be an exception
handler block, as implicitly created when entering an except handler. In
addition to popping extraneous values from the frame stack, the last three
popped values are used to restore the exception state.

`RERAISE`

    
Re-raises the exception currently on top of the stack.

New in version 3.9.

`WITH_EXCEPT_START`

    
Calls the function in position 7 on the stack with the top three items on the
stack as arguments. Used to implement the call
`context_manager.__exit__(*exc_info())` when an exception has occurred in a
`with` statement.

New in version 3.9.

`LOAD_ASSERTION_ERROR`

    
Pushes `AssertionError` onto the stack. Used by the `assert` statement.

New in version 3.9.

`LOAD_BUILD_CLASS`

    
Pushes `builtins.__build_class__()` onto the stack. It is later called by
`CALL_FUNCTION` to construct a class.

`SETUP_WITH(delta)`

    
This opcode performs several operations before a with block starts. First, it
loads `__exit__()` from the context manager and pushes it onto the stack for
later use by `WITH_CLEANUP_START`. Then, `__enter__()` is called, and a
finally block pointing to delta is pushed. Finally, the result of calling the
`__enter__()` method is pushed onto the stack. The next opcode will either
ignore it (`POP_TOP`), or store it in (a) variable(s) (`STORE_FAST`,
`STORE_NAME`, or `UNPACK_SEQUENCE`).

New in version 3.2.

All of the following opcodes use their arguments.

`STORE_NAME(namei)`

    
Implements `name = TOS`. namei is the index of name in the attribute
`co_names` of the code object. The compiler tries to use `STORE_FAST` or
`STORE_GLOBAL` if possible.

`DELETE_NAME(namei)`

    
Implements `del name`, where namei is the index into `co_names` attribute of
the code object.

`UNPACK_SEQUENCE(count)`

    
Unpacks TOS into count individual values, which are put onto the stack right-
to-left.

`UNPACK_EX(counts)`

    
Implements assignment with a starred target: Unpacks an iterable in TOS into
individual values, where the total number of values can be smaller than the
number of items in the iterable: one of the new values will be a list of all
leftover items.

The low byte of counts is the number of values before the list value, the high
byte of counts the number of values after it. The resulting values are put
onto the stack right-to-left.

`STORE_ATTR(namei)`

    
Implements `TOS.name = TOS1`, where namei is the index of name in `co_names`.

`DELETE_ATTR(namei)`

    
Implements `del TOS.name`, using namei as index into `co_names`.

`STORE_GLOBAL(namei)`

    
Works as `STORE_NAME`, but stores the name as a global.

`DELETE_GLOBAL(namei)`

    
Works as `DELETE_NAME`, but deletes a global name.

`LOAD_CONST(consti)`

    
Pushes `co_consts[consti]` onto the stack.

`LOAD_NAME(namei)`

    
Pushes the value associated with `co_names[namei]` onto the stack.

`BUILD_TUPLE(count)`

    
Creates a tuple consuming count items from the stack, and pushes the resulting
tuple onto the stack.

`BUILD_LIST(count)`

    
Works as `BUILD_TUPLE`, but creates a list.

`BUILD_SET(count)`

    
Works as `BUILD_TUPLE`, but creates a set.

`BUILD_MAP(count)`

    
Pushes a new dictionary object onto the stack. Pops `2 * count` items so that
the dictionary holds count entries: `{..., TOS3: TOS2, TOS1: TOS}`.

Changed in version 3.5: The dictionary is created from stack items instead of
creating an empty dictionary pre-sized to hold count items.

`BUILD_CONST_KEY_MAP(count)`

    
The version of `BUILD_MAP` specialized for constant keys. Pops the top element
on the stack which contains a tuple of keys, then starting from `TOS1`, pops
count values to form values in the built dictionary.

New in version 3.6.

`BUILD_STRING(count)`

    
Concatenates count strings from the stack and pushes the resulting string onto
the stack.

New in version 3.6.

`LIST_TO_TUPLE`

    
Pops a list from the stack and pushes a tuple containing the same values.

New in version 3.9.

`LIST_EXTEND(i)`

    
Calls `list.extend(TOS1[-i], TOS)`. Used to build lists.

New in version 3.9.

`SET_UPDATE(i)`

    
Calls `set.update(TOS1[-i], TOS)`. Used to build sets.

New in version 3.9.

`DICT_UPDATE(i)`

    
Calls `dict.update(TOS1[-i], TOS)`. Used to build dicts.

New in version 3.9.

`DICT_MERGE`

    
Like `DICT_UPDATE` but raises an exception for duplicate keys.

New in version 3.9.

`LOAD_ATTR(namei)`

    
Replaces TOS with `getattr(TOS, co_names[namei])`.

`COMPARE_OP(opname)`

    
Performs a Boolean operation. The operation name can be found in
`cmp_op[opname]`.

`IS_OP(invert)`

    
Performs `is` comparison, or `is not` if `invert` is 1.

New in version 3.9.

`CONTAINS_OP(invert)`

    
Performs `in` comparison, or `not in` if `invert` is 1.

New in version 3.9.

`IMPORT_NAME(namei)`

    
Imports the module `co_names[namei]`. TOS and TOS1 are popped and provide the
fromlist and level arguments of `__import__()`. The module object is pushed
onto the stack. The current namespace is not affected: for a proper import
statement, a subsequent `STORE_FAST` instruction modifies the namespace.

`IMPORT_FROM(namei)`

    
Loads the attribute `co_names[namei]` from the module found in TOS. The
resulting object is pushed onto the stack, to be subsequently stored by a
`STORE_FAST` instruction.

`JUMP_FORWARD(delta)`

    
Increments bytecode counter by delta.

`POP_JUMP_IF_TRUE(target)`

    
If TOS is true, sets the bytecode counter to target. TOS is popped.

New in version 3.1.

`POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE(target)`

    
If TOS is false, sets the bytecode counter to target. TOS is popped.

New in version 3.1.

`JUMP_IF_NOT_EXC_MATCH(target)`

    
Tests whether the second value on the stack is an exception matching TOS, and
jumps if it is not. Pops two values from the stack.

New in version 3.9.

`JUMP_IF_TRUE_OR_POP(target)`

    
If TOS is true, sets the bytecode counter to target and leaves TOS on the
stack. Otherwise (TOS is false), TOS is popped.

New in version 3.1.

`JUMP_IF_FALSE_OR_POP(target)`

    
If TOS is false, sets the bytecode counter to target and leaves TOS on the
stack. Otherwise (TOS is true), TOS is popped.

New in version 3.1.

`JUMP_ABSOLUTE(target)`

    
Set bytecode counter to target.

`FOR_ITER(delta)`

    
TOS is an iterator. Call its `__next__()` method. If this yields a new value,
push it on the stack (leaving the iterator below it). If the iterator
indicates it is exhausted, TOS is popped, and the byte code counter is
incremented by delta.

`LOAD_GLOBAL(namei)`

    
Loads the global named `co_names[namei]` onto the stack.

`SETUP_FINALLY(delta)`

    
Pushes a try block from a try-finally or try-except clause onto the block
stack. delta points to the finally block or the first except block.

`LOAD_FAST(var_num)`

    
Pushes a reference to the local `co_varnames[var_num]` onto the stack.

`STORE_FAST(var_num)`

    
Stores TOS into the local `co_varnames[var_num]`.

`DELETE_FAST(var_num)`

    
Deletes local `co_varnames[var_num]`.

`LOAD_CLOSURE(i)`

    
Pushes a reference to the cell contained in slot i of the cell and free
variable storage. The name of the variable is `co_cellvars[i]` if i is less
than the length of co_cellvars. Otherwise it is `co_freevars[i -
len(co_cellvars)]`.

`LOAD_DEREF(i)`

    
Loads the cell contained in slot i of the cell and free variable storage.
Pushes a reference to the object the cell contains on the stack.

`LOAD_CLASSDEREF(i)`

    
Much like `LOAD_DEREF` but first checks the locals dictionary before
consulting the cell. This is used for loading free variables in class bodies.

New in version 3.4.

`STORE_DEREF(i)`

    
Stores TOS into the cell contained in slot i of the cell and free variable
storage.

`DELETE_DEREF(i)`

    
Empties the cell contained in slot i of the cell and free variable storage.
Used by the `del` statement.

New in version 3.2.

`RAISE_VARARGS(argc)`

    
Raises an exception using one of the 3 forms of the `raise` statement,
depending on the value of argc:

  * 0: `raise` (re-raise previous exception)
  * 1: `raise TOS` (raise exception instance or type at `TOS`)
  * 2: `raise TOS1 from TOS` (raise exception instance or type at `TOS1` with `__cause__` set to `TOS`)

`CALL_FUNCTION(argc)`

    
Calls a callable object with positional arguments. argc indicates the number
of positional arguments. The top of the stack contains positional arguments,
with the right-most argument on top. Below the arguments is a callable object
to call. `CALL_FUNCTION` pops all arguments and the callable object off the
stack, calls the callable object with those arguments, and pushes the return
value returned by the callable object.

Changed in version 3.6: This opcode is used only for calls with positional
arguments.

`CALL_FUNCTION_KW(argc)`

    
Calls a callable object with positional (if any) and keyword arguments. argc
indicates the total number of positional and keyword arguments. The top
element on the stack contains a tuple with the names of the keyword arguments,
which must be strings. Below that are the values for the keyword arguments, in
the order corresponding to the tuple. Below that are positional arguments,
with the right-most parameter on top. Below the arguments is a callable object
to call. `CALL_FUNCTION_KW` pops all arguments and the callable object off the
stack, calls the callable object with those arguments, and pushes the return
value returned by the callable object.

Changed in version 3.6: Keyword arguments are packed in a tuple instead of a
dictionary, argc indicates the total number of arguments.

`CALL_FUNCTION_EX(flags)`

    
Calls a callable object with variable set of positional and keyword arguments.
If the lowest bit of flags is set, the top of the stack contains a mapping
object containing additional keyword arguments. Before the callable is called,
the mapping object and iterable object are each “unpacked” and their contents
passed in as keyword and positional arguments respectively. `CALL_FUNCTION_EX`
pops all arguments and the callable object off the stack, calls the callable
object with those arguments, and pushes the return value returned by the
callable object.

New in version 3.6.

`LOAD_METHOD(namei)`

    
Loads a method named `co_names[namei]` from the TOS object. TOS is popped.
This bytecode distinguishes two cases: if TOS has a method with the correct
name, the bytecode pushes the unbound method and TOS. TOS will be used as the
first argument (`self`) by `CALL_METHOD` when calling the unbound method.
Otherwise, `NULL` and the object return by the attribute lookup are pushed.

New in version 3.7.

`CALL_METHOD(argc)`

    
Calls a method. argc is the number of positional arguments. Keyword arguments
are not supported. This opcode is designed to be used with `LOAD_METHOD`.
Positional arguments are on top of the stack. Below them, the two items
described in `LOAD_METHOD` are on the stack (either `self` and an unbound
method object or `NULL` and an arbitrary callable). All of them are popped and
the return value is pushed.

New in version 3.7.

`MAKE_FUNCTION(flags)`

    
Pushes a new function object on the stack. From bottom to top, the consumed
stack must consist of values if the argument carries a specified flag value

  * `0x01` a tuple of default values for positional-only and positional-or-keyword parameters in positional order
  * `0x02` a dictionary of keyword-only parameters’ default values
  * `0x04` an annotation dictionary
  * `0x08` a tuple containing cells for free variables, making a closure
  * the code associated with the function (at TOS1)
  * the qualified name of the function (at TOS)

`BUILD_SLICE(argc)`

    
Pushes a slice object on the stack. argc must be 2 or 3. If it is 2,
`slice(TOS1, TOS)` is pushed; if it is 3, `slice(TOS2, TOS1, TOS)` is pushed.
See the `slice()` built-in function for more information.

`EXTENDED_ARG(ext)`

    
Prefixes any opcode which has an argument too big to fit into the default one
byte. ext holds an additional byte which act as higher bits in the argument.
For each opcode, at most three prefixal `EXTENDED_ARG` are allowed, forming an
argument from two-byte to four-byte.

`FORMAT_VALUE(flags)`

    
Used for implementing formatted literal strings (f-strings). Pops an optional
fmt_spec from the stack, then a required value. flags is interpreted as
follows:

  * `(flags & 0x03) == 0x00`: value is formatted as-is.
  * `(flags & 0x03) == 0x01`: call `str()` on value before formatting it.
  * `(flags & 0x03) == 0x02`: call `repr()` on value before formatting it.
  * `(flags & 0x03) == 0x03`: call `ascii()` on value before formatting it.
  * `(flags & 0x04) == 0x04`: pop fmt_spec from the stack and use it, else use an empty fmt_spec.

Formatting is performed using `PyObject_Format()`. The result is pushed on the
stack.

New in version 3.6.

`HAVE_ARGUMENT`

    
This is not really an opcode. It identifies the dividing line between opcodes
which don’t use their argument and those that do (`< HAVE_ARGUMENT` and `>=
HAVE_ARGUMENT`, respectively).

Changed in version 3.6: Now every instruction has an argument, but opcodes `<
HAVE_ARGUMENT` ignore it. Before, only opcodes `>= HAVE_ARGUMENT` had an
argument.

## Opcode collections

These collections are provided for automatic introspection of bytecode
instructions:

`dis.opname`

    
Sequence of operation names, indexable using the bytecode.

`dis.opmap`

    
Dictionary mapping operation names to bytecodes.

`dis.cmp_op`

    
Sequence of all compare operation names.

`dis.hasconst`

    
Sequence of bytecodes that access a constant.

`dis.hasfree`

    
Sequence of bytecodes that access a free variable (note that ‘free’ in this
context refers to names in the current scope that are referenced by inner
scopes or names in outer scopes that are referenced from this scope. It does
not include references to global or builtin scopes).

`dis.hasname`

    
Sequence of bytecodes that access an attribute by name.

`dis.hasjrel`

    
Sequence of bytecodes that have a relative jump target.

`dis.hasjabs`

    
Sequence of bytecodes that have an absolute jump target.

`dis.haslocal`

    
Sequence of bytecodes that access a local variable.

`dis.hascompare`

    
Sequence of bytecodes of Boolean operations.
