# textwrap — Text wrapping and filling

Source code: Lib/textwrap.py

The `textwrap` module provides some convenience functions, as well as
`TextWrapper`, the class that does all the work. If you’re just wrapping or
filling one or two text strings, the convenience functions should be good
enough; otherwise, you should use an instance of `TextWrapper` for efficiency.

`textwrap.wrap(text, width=70, **kwargs)`

    
Wraps the single paragraph in text (a string) so every line is at most width
characters long. Returns a list of output lines, without final newlines.

Optional keyword arguments correspond to the instance attributes of
`TextWrapper`, documented below. width defaults to `70`.

See the `TextWrapper.wrap()` method for additional details on how `wrap()`
behaves.

`textwrap.fill(text, width=70, **kwargs)`

    
Wraps the single paragraph in text, and returns a single string containing the
wrapped paragraph. `fill()` is shorthand for

    
    "\n".join(wrap(text, ...))
    
In particular, `fill()` accepts exactly the same keyword arguments as
`wrap()`.

`textwrap.shorten(text, width, **kwargs)`

    
Collapse and truncate the given text to fit in the given width.

First the whitespace in text is collapsed (all whitespace is replaced by
single spaces). If the result fits in the width, it is returned. Otherwise,
enough words are dropped from the end so that the remaining words plus the
`placeholder` fit within `width`:

    
    >>> textwrap.shorten("Hello  world!", width=12)
    'Hello world!'
    >>> textwrap.shorten("Hello  world!", width=11)
    'Hello [...]'
    >>> textwrap.shorten("Hello world", width=10, placeholder="...")
    'Hello...'
    
Optional keyword arguments correspond to the instance attributes of
`TextWrapper`, documented below. Note that the whitespace is collapsed before
the text is passed to the `TextWrapper` `fill()` function, so changing the
value of `tabsize`, `expand_tabs`, `drop_whitespace`, and `replace_whitespace`
will have no effect.

New in version 3.4.

`textwrap.dedent(text)`

    
Remove any common leading whitespace from every line in text.

This can be used to make triple-quoted strings line up with the left edge of
the display, while still presenting them in the source code in indented form.

Note that tabs and spaces are both treated as whitespace, but they are not
equal: the lines `" hello"` and `"\thello"` are considered to have no common
leading whitespace.

Lines containing only whitespace are ignored in the input and normalized to a
single newline character in the output.

For example:

    
    def test():
        # end first line with \ to avoid the empty line!
        s = '''\
        hello
          world
        '''
        print(repr(s))          # prints '    hello\n      world\n    '
        print(repr(dedent(s)))  # prints 'hello\n  world\n'
    
`textwrap.indent(text, prefix, predicate=None)`

    
Add prefix to the beginning of selected lines in text.

Lines are separated by calling `text.splitlines(True)`.

By default, prefix is added to all lines that do not consist solely of
whitespace (including any line endings).

For example:

    
    >>> s = 'hello\n\n \nworld'
    >>> indent(s, '  ')
    '  hello\n\n \n  world'
    
The optional predicate argument can be used to control which lines are
indented. For example, it is easy to add prefix to even empty and whitespace-
only lines:

    
    >>> print(indent(s, '+ ', lambda line: True))
    + hello
    +
    +
    + world
    
New in version 3.3.

`wrap()`, `fill()` and `shorten()` work by creating a `TextWrapper` instance
and calling a single method on it. That instance is not reused, so for
applications that process many text strings using `wrap()` and/or `fill()`, it
may be more efficient to create your own `TextWrapper` object.

Text is preferably wrapped on whitespaces and right after the hyphens in
hyphenated words; only then will long words be broken if necessary, unless
`TextWrapper.break_long_words` is set to false.

`class textwrap.TextWrapper(**kwargs)`

    
The `TextWrapper` constructor accepts a number of optional keyword arguments.
Each keyword argument corresponds to an instance attribute, so for example

    
    wrapper = TextWrapper(initial_indent="* ")
    
is the same as

    
    wrapper = TextWrapper()
    wrapper.initial_indent = "* "
    
You can re-use the same `TextWrapper` object many times, and you can change
any of its options through direct assignment to instance attributes between
uses.

The `TextWrapper` instance attributes (and keyword arguments to the
constructor) are as follows:

`width`

    
(default: `70`) The maximum length of wrapped lines. As long as there are no
individual words in the input text longer than `width`, `TextWrapper`
guarantees that no output line will be longer than `width` characters.

`expand_tabs`

    
(default: `True`) If true, then all tab characters in text will be expanded to
spaces using the `expandtabs()` method of text.

`tabsize`

    
(default: `8`) If `expand_tabs` is true, then all tab characters in text will
be expanded to zero or more spaces, depending on the current column and the
given tab size.

New in version 3.3.

`replace_whitespace`

    
(default: `True`) If true, after tab expansion but before wrapping, the
`wrap()` method will replace each whitespace character with a single space.
The whitespace characters replaced are as follows: tab, newline, vertical tab,
formfeed, and carriage return (`'\t\n\v\f\r'`).

Note

If `expand_tabs` is false and `replace_whitespace` is true, each tab character
will be replaced by a single space, which is not the same as tab expansion.

Note

If `replace_whitespace` is false, newlines may appear in the middle of a line
and cause strange output. For this reason, text should be split into
paragraphs (using `str.splitlines()` or similar) which are wrapped separately.

`drop_whitespace`

    
(default: `True`) If true, whitespace at the beginning and ending of every
line (after wrapping but before indenting) is dropped. Whitespace at the
beginning of the paragraph, however, is not dropped if non-whitespace follows
it. If whitespace being dropped takes up an entire line, the whole line is
dropped.

`initial_indent`

    
(default: `''`) String that will be prepended to the first line of wrapped
output. Counts towards the length of the first line. The empty string is not
indented.

`subsequent_indent`

    
(default: `''`) String that will be prepended to all lines of wrapped output
except the first. Counts towards the length of each line except the first.

`fix_sentence_endings`

    
(default: `False`) If true, `TextWrapper` attempts to detect sentence endings
and ensure that sentences are always separated by exactly two spaces. This is
generally desired for text in a monospaced font. However, the sentence
detection algorithm is imperfect: it assumes that a sentence ending consists
of a lowercase letter followed by one of `'.'`, `'!'`, or `'?'`, possibly
followed by one of `'"'` or `"'"`, followed by a space. One problem with this
is algorithm is that it is unable to detect the difference between “Dr.” in

    
    [...] Dr. Frankenstein's monster [...]
    
and “Spot.” in

    
    [...] See Spot. See Spot run [...]
    
`fix_sentence_endings` is false by default.

Since the sentence detection algorithm relies on `string.lowercase` for the
definition of “lowercase letter”, and a convention of using two spaces after a
period to separate sentences on the same line, it is specific to English-
language texts.

`break_long_words`

    
(default: `True`) If true, then words longer than `width` will be broken in
order to ensure that no lines are longer than `width`. If it is false, long
words will not be broken, and some lines may be longer than `width`. (Long
words will be put on a line by themselves, in order to minimize the amount by
which `width` is exceeded.)

`break_on_hyphens`

    
(default: `True`) If true, wrapping will occur preferably on whitespaces and
right after hyphens in compound words, as it is customary in English. If
false, only whitespaces will be considered as potentially good places for line
breaks, but you need to set `break_long_words` to false if you want truly
insecable words. Default behaviour in previous versions was to always allow
breaking hyphenated words.

`max_lines`

    
(default: `None`) If not `None`, then the output will contain at most
max_lines lines, with placeholder appearing at the end of the output.

New in version 3.4.

`placeholder`

    
(default: `' [...]'`) String that will appear at the end of the output text if
it has been truncated.

New in version 3.4.

`TextWrapper` also provides some public methods, analogous to the module-level
convenience functions:

`wrap(text)`

    
Wraps the single paragraph in text (a string) so every line is at most `width`
characters long. All wrapping options are taken from instance attributes of
the `TextWrapper` instance. Returns a list of output lines, without final
newlines. If the wrapped output has no content, the returned list is empty.

`fill(text)`

    
Wraps the single paragraph in text, and returns a single string containing the
wrapped paragraph.
