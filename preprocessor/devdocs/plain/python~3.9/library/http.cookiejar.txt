# http.cookiejar — Cookie handling for HTTP clients

Source code: Lib/http/cookiejar.py

The `http.cookiejar` module defines classes for automatic handling of HTTP
cookies. It is useful for accessing web sites that require small pieces of
data – cookies – to be set on the client machine by an HTTP response from a
web server, and then returned to the server in later HTTP requests.

Both the regular Netscape cookie protocol and the protocol defined by RFC 2965
are handled. RFC 2965 handling is switched off by default. RFC 2109 cookies
are parsed as Netscape cookies and subsequently treated either as Netscape or
RFC 2965 cookies according to the ‘policy’ in effect. Note that the great
majority of cookies on the Internet are Netscape cookies. `http.cookiejar`
attempts to follow the de-facto Netscape cookie protocol (which differs
substantially from that set out in the original Netscape specification),
including taking note of the `max-age` and `port` cookie-attributes introduced
with RFC 2965.

Note

The various named parameters found in Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers (eg.
`domain` and `expires`) are conventionally referred to as attributes. To
distinguish them from Python attributes, the documentation for this module
uses the term cookie-attribute instead.

The module defines the following exception:

`exception http.cookiejar.LoadError`

    
Instances of `FileCookieJar` raise this exception on failure to load cookies
from a file. `LoadError` is a subclass of `OSError`.

Changed in version 3.3: LoadError was made a subclass of `OSError` instead of
`IOError`.

The following classes are provided:

`class http.cookiejar.CookieJar(policy=None)`

    
policy is an object implementing the `CookiePolicy` interface.

The `CookieJar` class stores HTTP cookies. It extracts cookies from HTTP
requests, and returns them in HTTP responses. `CookieJar` instances
automatically expire contained cookies when necessary. Subclasses are also
responsible for storing and retrieving cookies from a file or database.

`class http.cookiejar.FileCookieJar(filename, delayload=None, policy=None)`

    
policy is an object implementing the `CookiePolicy` interface. For the other
arguments, see the documentation for the corresponding attributes.

A `CookieJar` which can load cookies from, and perhaps save cookies to, a file
on disk. Cookies are NOT loaded from the named file until either the `load()`
or `revert()` method is called. Subclasses of this class are documented in
section FileCookieJar subclasses and co-operation with web browsers.

Changed in version 3.8: The filename parameter supports a path-like object.

`class http.cookiejar.CookiePolicy`

    
This class is responsible for deciding whether each cookie should be accepted
from / returned to the server.

`class http.cookiejar.DefaultCookiePolicy(blocked_domains=None,
allowed_domains=None, netscape=True, rfc2965=False, rfc2109_as_netscape=None,
hide_cookie2=False, strict_domain=False, strict_rfc2965_unverifiable=True,
strict_ns_unverifiable=False,
strict_ns_domain=DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainLiberal,
strict_ns_set_initial_dollar=False, strict_ns_set_path=False,
secure_protocols=("https", "wss"))`

    
Constructor arguments should be passed as keyword arguments only.
blocked_domains is a sequence of domain names that we never accept cookies
from, nor return cookies to. allowed_domains if not `None`, this is a sequence
of the only domains for which we accept and return cookies. secure_protocols
is a sequence of protocols for which secure cookies can be added to. By
default https and wss (secure websocket) are considered secure protocols. For
all other arguments, see the documentation for `CookiePolicy` and
`DefaultCookiePolicy` objects.

`DefaultCookiePolicy` implements the standard accept / reject rules for
Netscape and RFC 2965 cookies. By default, RFC 2109 cookies (ie. cookies
received in a Set-Cookie header with a version cookie-attribute of 1) are
treated according to the RFC 2965 rules. However, if RFC 2965 handling is
turned off or `rfc2109_as_netscape` is `True`, RFC 2109 cookies are
‘downgraded’ by the `CookieJar` instance to Netscape cookies, by setting the
`version` attribute of the `Cookie` instance to 0. `DefaultCookiePolicy` also
provides some parameters to allow some fine-tuning of policy.

`class http.cookiejar.Cookie`

    
This class represents Netscape, RFC 2109 and RFC 2965 cookies. It is not
expected that users of `http.cookiejar` construct their own `Cookie`
instances. Instead, if necessary, call `make_cookies()` on a `CookieJar`
instance.

## CookieJar and FileCookieJar Objects

`CookieJar` objects support the iterator protocol for iterating over contained
`Cookie` objects.

`CookieJar` has the following methods:

`CookieJar.add_cookie_header(request)`

    
Add correct Cookie header to request.

If policy allows (ie. the `rfc2965` and `hide_cookie2` attributes of the
`CookieJar`’s `CookiePolicy` instance are true and false respectively), the
Cookie2 header is also added when appropriate.

The request object (usually a `urllib.request.Request` instance) must support
the methods `get_full_url()`, `get_host()`, `get_type()`, `unverifiable()`,
`has_header()`, `get_header()`, `header_items()`, `add_unredirected_header()`
and `origin_req_host` attribute as documented by `urllib.request`.

Changed in version 3.3: request object needs `origin_req_host` attribute.
Dependency on a deprecated method `get_origin_req_host()` has been removed.

`CookieJar.extract_cookies(response, request)`

    
Extract cookies from HTTP response and store them in the `CookieJar`, where
allowed by policy.

The `CookieJar` will look for allowable Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2 headers in
the response argument, and store cookies as appropriate (subject to the
`CookiePolicy.set_ok()` method’s approval).

The response object (usually the result of a call to
`urllib.request.urlopen()`, or similar) should support an `info()` method,
which returns an `email.message.Message` instance.

The request object (usually a `urllib.request.Request` instance) must support
the methods `get_full_url()`, `get_host()`, `unverifiable()`, and
`origin_req_host` attribute, as documented by `urllib.request`. The request is
used to set default values for cookie-attributes as well as for checking that
the cookie is allowed to be set.

Changed in version 3.3: request object needs `origin_req_host` attribute.
Dependency on a deprecated method `get_origin_req_host()` has been removed.

`CookieJar.set_policy(policy)`

    
Set the `CookiePolicy` instance to be used.

`CookieJar.make_cookies(response, request)`

    
Return sequence of `Cookie` objects extracted from response object.

See the documentation for `extract_cookies()` for the interfaces required of
the response and request arguments.

`CookieJar.set_cookie_if_ok(cookie, request)`

    
Set a `Cookie` if policy says it’s OK to do so.

`CookieJar.set_cookie(cookie)`

    
Set a `Cookie`, without checking with policy to see whether or not it should
be set.

`CookieJar.clear([domain[, path[, name]]])`

    
Clear some cookies.

If invoked without arguments, clear all cookies. If given a single argument,
only cookies belonging to that domain will be removed. If given two arguments,
cookies belonging to the specified domain and URL path are removed. If given
three arguments, then the cookie with the specified domain, path and name is
removed.

Raises `KeyError` if no matching cookie exists.

`CookieJar.clear_session_cookies()`

    
Discard all session cookies.

Discards all contained cookies that have a true `discard` attribute (usually
because they had either no `max-age` or `expires` cookie-attribute, or an
explicit `discard` cookie-attribute). For interactive browsers, the end of a
session usually corresponds to closing the browser window.

Note that the `save()` method won’t save session cookies anyway, unless you
ask otherwise by passing a true ignore_discard argument.

`FileCookieJar` implements the following additional methods:

`FileCookieJar.save(filename=None, ignore_discard=False,
ignore_expires=False)`

    
Save cookies to a file.

This base class raises `NotImplementedError`. Subclasses may leave this method
unimplemented.

filename is the name of file in which to save cookies. If filename is not
specified, `self.filename` is used (whose default is the value passed to the
constructor, if any); if `self.filename` is `None`, `ValueError` is raised.

ignore_discard: save even cookies set to be discarded. ignore_expires: save
even cookies that have expired

The file is overwritten if it already exists, thus wiping all the cookies it
contains. Saved cookies can be restored later using the `load()` or `revert()`
methods.

`FileCookieJar.load(filename=None, ignore_discard=False,
ignore_expires=False)`

    
Load cookies from a file.

Old cookies are kept unless overwritten by newly loaded ones.

Arguments are as for `save()`.

The named file must be in the format understood by the class, or `LoadError`
will be raised. Also, `OSError` may be raised, for example if the file does
not exist.

Changed in version 3.3: `IOError` used to be raised, it is now an alias of
`OSError`.

`FileCookieJar.revert(filename=None, ignore_discard=False,
ignore_expires=False)`

    
Clear all cookies and reload cookies from a saved file.

`revert()` can raise the same exceptions as `load()`. If there is a failure,
the object’s state will not be altered.

`FileCookieJar` instances have the following public attributes:

`FileCookieJar.filename`

    
Filename of default file in which to keep cookies. This attribute may be
assigned to.

`FileCookieJar.delayload`

    
If true, load cookies lazily from disk. This attribute should not be assigned
to. This is only a hint, since this only affects performance, not behaviour
(unless the cookies on disk are changing). A `CookieJar` object may ignore it.
None of the `FileCookieJar` classes included in the standard library lazily
loads cookies.

## FileCookieJar subclasses and co-operation with web browsers

The following `CookieJar` subclasses are provided for reading and writing.

`class http.cookiejar.MozillaCookieJar(filename, delayload=None, policy=None)`

    
A `FileCookieJar` that can load from and save cookies to disk in the Mozilla
`cookies.txt` file format (which is also used by the Lynx and Netscape
browsers).

Note

This loses information about RFC 2965 cookies, and also about newer or non-
standard cookie-attributes such as `port`.

Warning

Back up your cookies before saving if you have cookies whose loss / corruption
would be inconvenient (there are some subtleties which may lead to slight
changes in the file over a load / save round-trip).

Also note that cookies saved while Mozilla is running will get clobbered by
Mozilla.

`class http.cookiejar.LWPCookieJar(filename, delayload=None, policy=None)`

    
A `FileCookieJar` that can load from and save cookies to disk in format
compatible with the libwww-perl library’s `Set-Cookie3` file format. This is
convenient if you want to store cookies in a human-readable file.

Changed in version 3.8: The filename parameter supports a path-like object.

## CookiePolicy Objects

Objects implementing the `CookiePolicy` interface have the following methods:

`CookiePolicy.set_ok(cookie, request)`

    
Return boolean value indicating whether cookie should be accepted from server.

cookie is a `Cookie` instance. request is an object implementing the interface
defined by the documentation for `CookieJar.extract_cookies()`.

`CookiePolicy.return_ok(cookie, request)`

    
Return boolean value indicating whether cookie should be returned to server.

cookie is a `Cookie` instance. request is an object implementing the interface
defined by the documentation for `CookieJar.add_cookie_header()`.

`CookiePolicy.domain_return_ok(domain, request)`

    
Return `False` if cookies should not be returned, given cookie domain.

This method is an optimization. It removes the need for checking every cookie
with a particular domain (which might involve reading many files). Returning
true from `domain_return_ok()` and `path_return_ok()` leaves all the work to
`return_ok()`.

If `domain_return_ok()` returns true for the cookie domain, `path_return_ok()`
is called for the cookie path. Otherwise, `path_return_ok()` and `return_ok()`
are never called for that cookie domain. If `path_return_ok()` returns true,
`return_ok()` is called with the `Cookie` object itself for a full check.
Otherwise, `return_ok()` is never called for that cookie path.

Note that `domain_return_ok()` is called for every cookie domain, not just for
the request domain. For example, the function might be called with both
`".example.com"` and `"www.example.com"` if the request domain is
`"www.example.com"`. The same goes for `path_return_ok()`.

The request argument is as documented for `return_ok()`.

`CookiePolicy.path_return_ok(path, request)`

    
Return `False` if cookies should not be returned, given cookie path.

See the documentation for `domain_return_ok()`.

In addition to implementing the methods above, implementations of the
`CookiePolicy` interface must also supply the following attributes, indicating
which protocols should be used, and how. All of these attributes may be
assigned to.

`CookiePolicy.netscape`

    
Implement Netscape protocol.

`CookiePolicy.rfc2965`

    
Implement RFC 2965 protocol.

`CookiePolicy.hide_cookie2`

    
Don’t add Cookie2 header to requests (the presence of this header indicates to
the server that we understand RFC 2965 cookies).

The most useful way to define a `CookiePolicy` class is by subclassing from
`DefaultCookiePolicy` and overriding some or all of the methods above.
`CookiePolicy` itself may be used as a ‘null policy’ to allow setting and
receiving any and all cookies (this is unlikely to be useful).

## DefaultCookiePolicy Objects

Implements the standard rules for accepting and returning cookies.

Both RFC 2965 and Netscape cookies are covered. RFC 2965 handling is switched
off by default.

The easiest way to provide your own policy is to override this class and call
its methods in your overridden implementations before adding your own
additional checks:

    
    import http.cookiejar
    class MyCookiePolicy(http.cookiejar.DefaultCookiePolicy):
        def set_ok(self, cookie, request):
            if not http.cookiejar.DefaultCookiePolicy.set_ok(self, cookie, request):
                return False
            if i_dont_want_to_store_this_cookie(cookie):
                return False
            return True
    
In addition to the features required to implement the `CookiePolicy`
interface, this class allows you to block and allow domains from setting and
receiving cookies. There are also some strictness switches that allow you to
tighten up the rather loose Netscape protocol rules a little bit (at the cost
of blocking some benign cookies).

A domain blacklist and whitelist is provided (both off by default). Only
domains not in the blacklist and present in the whitelist (if the whitelist is
active) participate in cookie setting and returning. Use the blocked_domains
constructor argument, and `blocked_domains()` and `set_blocked_domains()`
methods (and the corresponding argument and methods for allowed_domains). If
you set a whitelist, you can turn it off again by setting it to `None`.

Domains in block or allow lists that do not start with a dot must equal the
cookie domain to be matched. For example, `"example.com"` matches a blacklist
entry of `"example.com"`, but `"www.example.com"` does not. Domains that do
start with a dot are matched by more specific domains too. For example, both
`"www.example.com"` and `"www.coyote.example.com"` match `".example.com"` (but
`"example.com"` itself does not). IP addresses are an exception, and must
match exactly. For example, if blocked_domains contains `"192.168.1.2"` and
`".168.1.2"`, 192.168.1.2 is blocked, but 193.168.1.2 is not.

`DefaultCookiePolicy` implements the following additional methods:

`DefaultCookiePolicy.blocked_domains()`

    
Return the sequence of blocked domains (as a tuple).

`DefaultCookiePolicy.set_blocked_domains(blocked_domains)`

    
Set the sequence of blocked domains.

`DefaultCookiePolicy.is_blocked(domain)`

    
Return whether domain is on the blacklist for setting or receiving cookies.

`DefaultCookiePolicy.allowed_domains()`

    
Return `None`, or the sequence of allowed domains (as a tuple).

`DefaultCookiePolicy.set_allowed_domains(allowed_domains)`

    
Set the sequence of allowed domains, or `None`.

`DefaultCookiePolicy.is_not_allowed(domain)`

    
Return whether domain is not on the whitelist for setting or receiving
cookies.

`DefaultCookiePolicy` instances have the following attributes, which are all
initialised from the constructor arguments of the same name, and which may all
be assigned to.

`DefaultCookiePolicy.rfc2109_as_netscape`

    
If true, request that the `CookieJar` instance downgrade RFC 2109 cookies (ie.
cookies received in a Set-Cookie header with a version cookie-attribute of 1)
to Netscape cookies by setting the version attribute of the `Cookie` instance
to 0. The default value is `None`, in which case RFC 2109 cookies are
downgraded if and only if RFC 2965 handling is turned off. Therefore, RFC 2109
cookies are downgraded by default.

General strictness switches:

`DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_domain`

    
Don’t allow sites to set two-component domains with country-code top-level
domains like `.co.uk`, `.gov.uk`, `.co.nz`.etc. This is far from perfect and
isn’t guaranteed to work!

RFC 2965 protocol strictness switches:

`DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_rfc2965_unverifiable`

    
Follow RFC 2965 rules on unverifiable transactions (usually, an unverifiable
transaction is one resulting from a redirect or a request for an image hosted
on another site). If this is false, cookies are never blocked on the basis of
verifiability

Netscape protocol strictness switches:

`DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_ns_unverifiable`

    
Apply RFC 2965 rules on unverifiable transactions even to Netscape cookies.

`DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_ns_domain`

    
Flags indicating how strict to be with domain-matching rules for Netscape
cookies. See below for acceptable values.

`DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_ns_set_initial_dollar`

    
Ignore cookies in Set-Cookie: headers that have names starting with `'$'`.

`DefaultCookiePolicy.strict_ns_set_path`

    
Don’t allow setting cookies whose path doesn’t path-match request URI.

`strict_ns_domain` is a collection of flags. Its value is constructed by or-
ing together (for example, `DomainStrictNoDots|DomainStrictNonDomain` means
both flags are set).

`DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainStrictNoDots`

    
When setting cookies, the ‘host prefix’ must not contain a dot (eg.
`www.foo.bar.com` can’t set a cookie for `.bar.com`, because `www.foo`
contains a dot).

`DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainStrictNonDomain`

    
Cookies that did not explicitly specify a `domain` cookie-attribute can only
be returned to a domain equal to the domain that set the cookie (eg.
`spam.example.com` won’t be returned cookies from `example.com` that had no
`domain` cookie-attribute).

`DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainRFC2965Match`

    
When setting cookies, require a full RFC 2965 domain-match.

The following attributes are provided for convenience, and are the most useful
combinations of the above flags:

`DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainLiberal`

    
Equivalent to 0 (ie. all of the above Netscape domain strictness flags
switched off).

`DefaultCookiePolicy.DomainStrict`

    
Equivalent to `DomainStrictNoDots|DomainStrictNonDomain`.

## Cookie Objects

`Cookie` instances have Python attributes roughly corresponding to the
standard cookie-attributes specified in the various cookie standards. The
correspondence is not one-to-one, because there are complicated rules for
assigning default values, because the `max-age` and `expires` cookie-
attributes contain equivalent information, and because RFC 2109 cookies may be
‘downgraded’ by `http.cookiejar` from version 1 to version 0 (Netscape)
cookies.

Assignment to these attributes should not be necessary other than in rare
circumstances in a `CookiePolicy` method. The class does not enforce internal
consistency, so you should know what you’re doing if you do that.

`Cookie.version`

    
Integer or `None`. Netscape cookies have `version` 0\. RFC 2965 and RFC 2109
cookies have a `version` cookie-attribute of 1. However, note that
`http.cookiejar` may ‘downgrade’ RFC 2109 cookies to Netscape cookies, in
which case `version` is 0.

`Cookie.name`

    
Cookie name (a string).

`Cookie.value`

    
Cookie value (a string), or `None`.

`Cookie.port`

    
String representing a port or a set of ports (eg. ‘80’, or ‘80,8080’), or
`None`.

`Cookie.path`

    
Cookie path (a string, eg. `'/acme/rocket_launchers'`).

`Cookie.secure`

    
`True` if cookie should only be returned over a secure connection.

`Cookie.expires`

    
Integer expiry date in seconds since epoch, or `None`. See also the
`is_expired()` method.

`Cookie.discard`

    
`True` if this is a session cookie.

`Cookie.comment`

    
String comment from the server explaining the function of this cookie, or
`None`.

`Cookie.comment_url`

    
URL linking to a comment from the server explaining the function of this
cookie, or `None`.

`Cookie.rfc2109`

    
`True` if this cookie was received as an RFC 2109 cookie (ie. the cookie
arrived in a Set-Cookie header, and the value of the Version cookie-attribute
in that header was 1). This attribute is provided because `http.cookiejar` may
‘downgrade’ RFC 2109 cookies to Netscape cookies, in which case `version` is
0.

`Cookie.port_specified`

    
`True` if a port or set of ports was explicitly specified by the server (in
the Set-Cookie / Set-Cookie2 header).

`Cookie.domain_specified`

    
`True` if a domain was explicitly specified by the server.

`Cookie.domain_initial_dot`

    
`True` if the domain explicitly specified by the server began with a dot
(`'.'`).

Cookies may have additional non-standard cookie-attributes. These may be
accessed using the following methods:

`Cookie.has_nonstandard_attr(name)`

    
Return `True` if cookie has the named cookie-attribute.

`Cookie.get_nonstandard_attr(name, default=None)`

    
If cookie has the named cookie-attribute, return its value. Otherwise, return
default.

`Cookie.set_nonstandard_attr(name, value)`

    
Set the value of the named cookie-attribute.

The `Cookie` class also defines the following method:

`Cookie.is_expired(now=None)`

    
`True` if cookie has passed the time at which the server requested it should
expire. If now is given (in seconds since the epoch), return whether the
cookie has expired at the specified time.

## Examples

The first example shows the most common usage of `http.cookiejar`:

    
    import http.cookiejar, urllib.request
    cj = http.cookiejar.CookieJar()
    opener = urllib.request.build_opener(urllib.request.HTTPCookieProcessor(cj))
    r = opener.open("http://example.com/")
    
This example illustrates how to open a URL using your Netscape, Mozilla, or
Lynx cookies (assumes Unix/Netscape convention for location of the cookies
file):

    
    import os, http.cookiejar, urllib.request
    cj = http.cookiejar.MozillaCookieJar()
    cj.load(os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), ".netscape", "cookies.txt"))
    opener = urllib.request.build_opener(urllib.request.HTTPCookieProcessor(cj))
    r = opener.open("http://example.com/")
    
The next example illustrates the use of `DefaultCookiePolicy`. Turn on RFC
2965 cookies, be more strict about domains when setting and returning Netscape
cookies, and block some domains from setting cookies or having them returned:

    
    import urllib.request
    from http.cookiejar import CookieJar, DefaultCookiePolicy
    policy = DefaultCookiePolicy(
        rfc2965=True, strict_ns_domain=Policy.DomainStrict,
        blocked_domains=["ads.net", ".ads.net"])
    cj = CookieJar(policy)
    opener = urllib.request.build_opener(urllib.request.HTTPCookieProcessor(cj))
    r = opener.open("http://example.com/")
