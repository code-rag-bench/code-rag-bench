# html.entities — Definitions of HTML general entities

Source code: Lib/html/entities.py

This module defines four dictionaries, `html5`, `name2codepoint`,
`codepoint2name`, and `entitydefs`.

`html.entities.html5`

    
A dictionary that maps HTML5 named character references 1 to the equivalent
Unicode character(s), e.g. `html5['gt;'] == '>'`. Note that the trailing
semicolon is included in the name (e.g. `'gt;'`), however some of the names
are accepted by the standard even without the semicolon: in this case the name
is present with and without the `';'`. See also `html.unescape()`.

New in version 3.3.

`html.entities.entitydefs`

    
A dictionary mapping XHTML 1.0 entity definitions to their replacement text in
ISO Latin-1.

`html.entities.name2codepoint`

    
A dictionary that maps HTML entity names to the Unicode code points.

`html.entities.codepoint2name`

    
A dictionary that maps Unicode code points to HTML entity names.
