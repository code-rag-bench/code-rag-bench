# zipfile — Work with ZIP archives

Source code: Lib/zipfile.py

The ZIP file format is a common archive and compression standard. This module
provides tools to create, read, write, append, and list a ZIP file. Any
advanced use of this module will require an understanding of the format, as
defined in PKZIP Application Note.

This module does not currently handle multi-disk ZIP files. It can handle ZIP
files that use the ZIP64 extensions (that is ZIP files that are more than 4
GiB in size). It supports decryption of encrypted files in ZIP archives, but
it currently cannot create an encrypted file. Decryption is extremely slow as
it is implemented in native Python rather than C.

The module defines the following items:

`exception zipfile.BadZipFile`

    
The error raised for bad ZIP files.

New in version 3.2.

`exception zipfile.BadZipfile`

    
Alias of `BadZipFile`, for compatibility with older Python versions.

Deprecated since version 3.2.

`exception zipfile.LargeZipFile`

    
The error raised when a ZIP file would require ZIP64 functionality but that
has not been enabled.

`class zipfile.ZipFile`

    
The class for reading and writing ZIP files. See section ZipFile Objects for
constructor details.

`class zipfile.Path`

    
A pathlib-compatible wrapper for zip files. See section Path Objects for
details.

New in version 3.8.

`class zipfile.PyZipFile`

    
Class for creating ZIP archives containing Python libraries.

`class zipfile.ZipInfo(filename='NoName', date_time=(1980, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0))`

    
Class used to represent information about a member of an archive. Instances of
this class are returned by the `getinfo()` and `infolist()` methods of
`ZipFile` objects. Most users of the `zipfile` module will not need to create
these, but only use those created by this module. filename should be the full
name of the archive member, and date_time should be a tuple containing six
fields which describe the time of the last modification to the file; the
fields are described in section ZipInfo Objects.

`zipfile.is_zipfile(filename)`

    
Returns `True` if filename is a valid ZIP file based on its magic number,
otherwise returns `False`. filename may be a file or file-like object too.

Changed in version 3.1: Support for file and file-like objects.

`zipfile.ZIP_STORED`

    
The numeric constant for an uncompressed archive member.

`zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED`

    
The numeric constant for the usual ZIP compression method. This requires the
`zlib` module.

`zipfile.ZIP_BZIP2`

    
The numeric constant for the BZIP2 compression method. This requires the `bz2`
module.

New in version 3.3.

`zipfile.ZIP_LZMA`

    
The numeric constant for the LZMA compression method. This requires the `lzma`
module.

New in version 3.3.

Note

The ZIP file format specification has included support for bzip2 compression
since 2001, and for LZMA compression since 2006. However, some tools
(including older Python releases) do not support these compression methods,
and may either refuse to process the ZIP file altogether, or fail to extract
individual files.

## ZipFile Objects

`class zipfile.ZipFile(file, mode='r', compression=ZIP_STORED,
allowZip64=True, compresslevel=None, *, strict_timestamps=True)`

    
Open a ZIP file, where file can be a path to a file (a string), a file-like
object or a path-like object.

The mode parameter should be `'r'` to read an existing file, `'w'` to truncate
and write a new file, `'a'` to append to an existing file, or `'x'` to
exclusively create and write a new file. If mode is `'x'` and file refers to
an existing file, a `FileExistsError` will be raised. If mode is `'a'` and
file refers to an existing ZIP file, then additional files are added to it. If
file does not refer to a ZIP file, then a new ZIP archive is appended to the
file. This is meant for adding a ZIP archive to another file (such as
`python.exe`). If mode is `'a'` and the file does not exist at all, it is
created. If mode is `'r'` or `'a'`, the file should be seekable.

compression is the ZIP compression method to use when writing the archive, and
should be `ZIP_STORED`, `ZIP_DEFLATED`, `ZIP_BZIP2` or `ZIP_LZMA`;
unrecognized values will cause `NotImplementedError` to be raised. If
`ZIP_DEFLATED`, `ZIP_BZIP2` or `ZIP_LZMA` is specified but the corresponding
module (`zlib`, `bz2` or `lzma`) is not available, `RuntimeError` is raised.
The default is `ZIP_STORED`.

If allowZip64 is `True` (the default) zipfile will create ZIP files that use
the ZIP64 extensions when the zipfile is larger than 4 GiB. If it is `false`
`zipfile` will raise an exception when the ZIP file would require ZIP64
extensions.

The compresslevel parameter controls the compression level to use when writing
files to the archive. When using `ZIP_STORED` or `ZIP_LZMA` it has no effect.
When using `ZIP_DEFLATED` integers `0` through `9` are accepted (see `zlib`
for more information). When using `ZIP_BZIP2` integers `1` through `9` are
accepted (see `bz2` for more information).

The strict_timestamps argument, when set to `False`, allows to zip files older
than 1980-01-01 at the cost of setting the timestamp to 1980-01-01. Similar
behavior occurs with files newer than 2107-12-31, the timestamp is also set to
the limit.

If the file is created with mode `'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'` and then `closed`
without adding any files to the archive, the appropriate ZIP structures for an
empty archive will be written to the file.

ZipFile is also a context manager and therefore supports the `with` statement.
In the example, myzip is closed after the `with` statement’s suite is
finished—even if an exception occurs:

    
    with ZipFile('spam.zip', 'w') as myzip:
        myzip.write('eggs.txt')
    
New in version 3.2: Added the ability to use `ZipFile` as a context manager.

Changed in version 3.3: Added support for `bzip2` and `lzma` compression.

Changed in version 3.4: ZIP64 extensions are enabled by default.

Changed in version 3.5: Added support for writing to unseekable streams. Added
support for the `'x'` mode.

Changed in version 3.6: Previously, a plain `RuntimeError` was raised for
unrecognized compression values.

Changed in version 3.6.2: The file parameter accepts a path-like object.

Changed in version 3.7: Add the compresslevel parameter.

New in version 3.8: The strict_timestamps keyword-only argument

`ZipFile.close()`

    
Close the archive file. You must call `close()` before exiting your program or
essential records will not be written.

`ZipFile.getinfo(name)`

    
Return a `ZipInfo` object with information about the archive member name.
Calling `getinfo()` for a name not currently contained in the archive will
raise a `KeyError`.

`ZipFile.infolist()`

    
Return a list containing a `ZipInfo` object for each member of the archive.
The objects are in the same order as their entries in the actual ZIP file on
disk if an existing archive was opened.

`ZipFile.namelist()`

    
Return a list of archive members by name.

`ZipFile.open(name, mode='r', pwd=None, *, force_zip64=False)`

    
Access a member of the archive as a binary file-like object. name can be
either the name of a file within the archive or a `ZipInfo` object. The mode
parameter, if included, must be `'r'` (the default) or `'w'`. pwd is the
password used to decrypt encrypted ZIP files.

`open()` is also a context manager and therefore supports the `with`
statement:

    
    with ZipFile('spam.zip') as myzip:
        with myzip.open('eggs.txt') as myfile:
            print(myfile.read())
    
With mode `'r'` the file-like object (`ZipExtFile`) is read-only and provides
the following methods: `read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`, `seek()`,
`tell()`, `__iter__()`, `__next__()`. These objects can operate independently
of the ZipFile.

With `mode='w'`, a writable file handle is returned, which supports the
`write()` method. While a writable file handle is open, attempting to read or
write other files in the ZIP file will raise a `ValueError`.

When writing a file, if the file size is not known in advance but may exceed 2
GiB, pass `force_zip64=True` to ensure that the header format is capable of
supporting large files. If the file size is known in advance, construct a
`ZipInfo` object with `file_size` set, and use that as the name parameter.

Note

The `open()`, `read()` and `extract()` methods can take a filename or a
`ZipInfo` object. You will appreciate this when trying to read a ZIP file that
contains members with duplicate names.

Changed in version 3.6: Removed support of `mode='U'`. Use `io.TextIOWrapper`
for reading compressed text files in universal newlines mode.

Changed in version 3.6: `open()` can now be used to write files into the
archive with the `mode='w'` option.

Changed in version 3.6: Calling `open()` on a closed ZipFile will raise a
`ValueError`. Previously, a `RuntimeError` was raised.

`ZipFile.extract(member, path=None, pwd=None)`

    
Extract a member from the archive to the current working directory; member
must be its full name or a `ZipInfo` object. Its file information is extracted
as accurately as possible. path specifies a different directory to extract to.
member can be a filename or a `ZipInfo` object. pwd is the password used for
encrypted files.

Returns the normalized path created (a directory or new file).

Note

If a member filename is an absolute path, a drive/UNC sharepoint and leading
(back)slashes will be stripped, e.g.: `///foo/bar` becomes `foo/bar` on Unix,
and `C:\foo\bar` becomes `foo\bar` on Windows. And all `".."` components in a
member filename will be removed, e.g.: `../../foo../../ba..r` becomes
`foo../ba..r`. On Windows illegal characters (`:`, `<`, `>`, `|`, `"`, `?`,
and `*`) replaced by underscore (`_`).

Changed in version 3.6: Calling `extract()` on a closed ZipFile will raise a
`ValueError`. Previously, a `RuntimeError` was raised.

Changed in version 3.6.2: The path parameter accepts a path-like object.

`ZipFile.extractall(path=None, members=None, pwd=None)`

    
Extract all members from the archive to the current working directory. path
specifies a different directory to extract to. members is optional and must be
a subset of the list returned by `namelist()`. pwd is the password used for
encrypted files.

Warning

Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection. It is
possible that files are created outside of path, e.g. members that have
absolute filenames starting with `"/"` or filenames with two dots `".."`. This
module attempts to prevent that. See `extract()` note.

Changed in version 3.6: Calling `extractall()` on a closed ZipFile will raise
a `ValueError`. Previously, a `RuntimeError` was raised.

Changed in version 3.6.2: The path parameter accepts a path-like object.

`ZipFile.printdir()`

    
Print a table of contents for the archive to `sys.stdout`.

`ZipFile.setpassword(pwd)`

    
Set pwd as default password to extract encrypted files.

`ZipFile.read(name, pwd=None)`

    
Return the bytes of the file name in the archive. name is the name of the file
in the archive, or a `ZipInfo` object. The archive must be open for read or
append. pwd is the password used for encrypted files and, if specified, it
will override the default password set with `setpassword()`. Calling `read()`
on a ZipFile that uses a compression method other than `ZIP_STORED`,
`ZIP_DEFLATED`, `ZIP_BZIP2` or `ZIP_LZMA` will raise a `NotImplementedError`.
An error will also be raised if the corresponding compression module is not
available.

Changed in version 3.6: Calling `read()` on a closed ZipFile will raise a
`ValueError`. Previously, a `RuntimeError` was raised.

`ZipFile.testzip()`

    
Read all the files in the archive and check their CRC’s and file headers.
Return the name of the first bad file, or else return `None`.

Changed in version 3.6: Calling `testzip()` on a closed ZipFile will raise a
`ValueError`. Previously, a `RuntimeError` was raised.

`ZipFile.write(filename, arcname=None, compress_type=None,
compresslevel=None)`

    
Write the file named filename to the archive, giving it the archive name
arcname (by default, this will be the same as filename, but without a drive
letter and with leading path separators removed). If given, compress_type
overrides the value given for the compression parameter to the constructor for
the new entry. Similarly, compresslevel will override the constructor if
given. The archive must be open with mode `'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'`.

Note

Archive names should be relative to the archive root, that is, they should not
start with a path separator.

Note

If `arcname` (or `filename`, if `arcname` is not given) contains a null byte,
the name of the file in the archive will be truncated at the null byte.

Changed in version 3.6: Calling `write()` on a ZipFile created with mode `'r'`
or a closed ZipFile will raise a `ValueError`. Previously, a `RuntimeError`
was raised.

`ZipFile.writestr(zinfo_or_arcname, data, compress_type=None,
compresslevel=None)`

    
Write a file into the archive. The contents is data, which may be either a
`str` or a `bytes` instance; if it is a `str`, it is encoded as UTF-8 first.
zinfo_or_arcname is either the file name it will be given in the archive, or a
`ZipInfo` instance. If it’s an instance, at least the filename, date, and time
must be given. If it’s a name, the date and time is set to the current date
and time. The archive must be opened with mode `'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'`.

If given, compress_type overrides the value given for the compression
parameter to the constructor for the new entry, or in the zinfo_or_arcname (if
that is a `ZipInfo` instance). Similarly, compresslevel will override the
constructor if given.

Note

When passing a `ZipInfo` instance as the zinfo_or_arcname parameter, the
compression method used will be that specified in the compress_type member of
the given `ZipInfo` instance. By default, the `ZipInfo` constructor sets this
member to `ZIP_STORED`.

Changed in version 3.2: The compress_type argument.

Changed in version 3.6: Calling `writestr()` on a ZipFile created with mode
`'r'` or a closed ZipFile will raise a `ValueError`. Previously, a
`RuntimeError` was raised.

The following data attributes are also available:

`ZipFile.filename`

    
Name of the ZIP file.

`ZipFile.debug`

    
The level of debug output to use. This may be set from `0` (the default, no
output) to `3` (the most output). Debugging information is written to
`sys.stdout`.

`ZipFile.comment`

    
The comment associated with the ZIP file as a `bytes` object. If assigning a
comment to a `ZipFile` instance created with mode `'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'`, it
should be no longer than 65535 bytes. Comments longer than this will be
truncated.

## Path Objects

`class zipfile.Path(root, at='')`

    
Construct a Path object from a `root` zipfile (which may be a `ZipFile`
instance or `file` suitable for passing to the `ZipFile` constructor).

`at` specifies the location of this Path within the zipfile, e.g.
‘dir/file.txt’, ‘dir/’, or ‘’. Defaults to the empty string, indicating the
root.

Path objects expose the following features of `pathlib.Path` objects:

Path objects are traversable using the `/` operator.

`Path.name`

    
The final path component.

`Path.open(mode='r', *, pwd, **)`

    
Invoke `ZipFile.open()` on the current path. Allows opening for read or write,
text or binary through supported modes: ‘r’, ‘w’, ‘rb’, ‘wb’. Positional and
keyword arguments are passed through to `io.TextIOWrapper` when opened as text
and ignored otherwise. `pwd` is the `pwd` parameter to `ZipFile.open()`.

Changed in version 3.9: Added support for text and binary modes for open.
Default mode is now text.

`Path.iterdir()`

    
Enumerate the children of the current directory.

`Path.is_dir()`

    
Return `True` if the current context references a directory.

`Path.is_file()`

    
Return `True` if the current context references a file.

`Path.exists()`

    
Return `True` if the current context references a file or directory in the zip
file.

`Path.read_text(*, **)`

    
Read the current file as unicode text. Positional and keyword arguments are
passed through to `io.TextIOWrapper` (except `buffer`, which is implied by the
context).

`Path.read_bytes()`

    
Read the current file as bytes.

## PyZipFile Objects

The `PyZipFile` constructor takes the same parameters as the `ZipFile`
constructor, and one additional parameter, optimize.

`class zipfile.PyZipFile(file, mode='r', compression=ZIP_STORED,
allowZip64=True, optimize=-1)`

    
New in version 3.2: The optimize parameter.

Changed in version 3.4: ZIP64 extensions are enabled by default.

Instances have one method in addition to those of `ZipFile` objects:

`writepy(pathname, basename='', filterfunc=None)`

    
Search for files `*.py` and add the corresponding file to the archive.

If the optimize parameter to `PyZipFile` was not given or `-1`, the
corresponding file is a `*.pyc` file, compiling if necessary.

If the optimize parameter to `PyZipFile` was `0`, `1` or `2`, only files with
that optimization level (see `compile()`) are added to the archive, compiling
if necessary.

If pathname is a file, the filename must end with `.py`, and just the
(corresponding `*.pyc`) file is added at the top level (no path information).
If pathname is a file that does not end with `.py`, a `RuntimeError` will be
raised. If it is a directory, and the directory is not a package directory,
then all the files `*.pyc` are added at the top level. If the directory is a
package directory, then all `*.pyc` are added under the package name as a file
path, and if any subdirectories are package directories, all of these are
added recursively in sorted order.

basename is intended for internal use only.

filterfunc, if given, must be a function taking a single string argument. It
will be passed each path (including each individual full file path) before it
is added to the archive. If filterfunc returns a false value, the path will
not be added, and if it is a directory its contents will be ignored. For
example, if our test files are all either in `test` directories or start with
the string `test_`, we can use a filterfunc to exclude them:

    
    >>> zf = PyZipFile('myprog.zip')
    >>> def notests(s):
    ...     fn = os.path.basename(s)
    ...     return (not (fn == 'test' or fn.startswith('test_')))
    >>> zf.writepy('myprog', filterfunc=notests)
    
The `writepy()` method makes archives with file names like this:

    
    string.pyc                   # Top level name
    test/__init__.pyc            # Package directory
    test/testall.pyc             # Module test.testall
    test/bogus/__init__.pyc      # Subpackage directory
    test/bogus/myfile.pyc        # Submodule test.bogus.myfile
    
New in version 3.4: The filterfunc parameter.

Changed in version 3.6.2: The pathname parameter accepts a path-like object.

Changed in version 3.7: Recursion sorts directory entries.

## ZipInfo Objects

Instances of the `ZipInfo` class are returned by the `getinfo()` and
`infolist()` methods of `ZipFile` objects. Each object stores information
about a single member of the ZIP archive.

There is one classmethod to make a `ZipInfo` instance for a filesystem file:

`classmethod ZipInfo.from_file(filename, arcname=None, *,
strict_timestamps=True)`

    
Construct a `ZipInfo` instance for a file on the filesystem, in preparation
for adding it to a zip file.

filename should be the path to a file or directory on the filesystem.

If arcname is specified, it is used as the name within the archive. If arcname
is not specified, the name will be the same as filename, but with any drive
letter and leading path separators removed.

The strict_timestamps argument, when set to `False`, allows to zip files older
than 1980-01-01 at the cost of setting the timestamp to 1980-01-01. Similar
behavior occurs with files newer than 2107-12-31, the timestamp is also set to
the limit.

New in version 3.6.

Changed in version 3.6.2: The filename parameter accepts a path-like object.

New in version 3.8: The strict_timestamps keyword-only argument

Instances have the following methods and attributes:

`ZipInfo.is_dir()`

    
Return `True` if this archive member is a directory.

This uses the entry’s name: directories should always end with `/`.

New in version 3.6.

`ZipInfo.filename`

    
Name of the file in the archive.

`ZipInfo.date_time`

    
The time and date of the last modification to the archive member. This is a
tuple of six values:

Index | Value  
---|---  
`0` | Year (>= 1980)  
`1` | Month (one-based)  
`2` | Day of month (one-based)  
`3` | Hours (zero-based)  
`4` | Minutes (zero-based)  
`5` | Seconds (zero-based)  
Note

The ZIP file format does not support timestamps before 1980.

`ZipInfo.compress_type`

    
Type of compression for the archive member.

`ZipInfo.comment`

    
Comment for the individual archive member as a `bytes` object.

`ZipInfo.extra`

    
Expansion field data. The PKZIP Application Note contains some comments on the
internal structure of the data contained in this `bytes` object.

`ZipInfo.create_system`

    
System which created ZIP archive.

`ZipInfo.create_version`

    
PKZIP version which created ZIP archive.

`ZipInfo.extract_version`

    
PKZIP version needed to extract archive.

`ZipInfo.reserved`

    
Must be zero.

`ZipInfo.flag_bits`

    
ZIP flag bits.

`ZipInfo.volume`

    
Volume number of file header.

`ZipInfo.internal_attr`

    
Internal attributes.

`ZipInfo.external_attr`

    
External file attributes.

`ZipInfo.header_offset`

    
Byte offset to the file header.

`ZipInfo.CRC`

    
CRC-32 of the uncompressed file.

`ZipInfo.compress_size`

    
Size of the compressed data.

`ZipInfo.file_size`

    
Size of the uncompressed file.

## Command-Line Interface

The `zipfile` module provides a simple command-line interface to interact with
ZIP archives.

If you want to create a new ZIP archive, specify its name after the `-c`
option and then list the filename(s) that should be included:

    
    $ python -m zipfile -c monty.zip spam.txt eggs.txt
    
Passing a directory is also acceptable:

    
    $ python -m zipfile -c monty.zip life-of-brian_1979/
    
If you want to extract a ZIP archive into the specified directory, use the
`-e` option:

    
    $ python -m zipfile -e monty.zip target-dir/
    
For a list of the files in a ZIP archive, use the `-l` option:

    
    $ python -m zipfile -l monty.zip
    
### Command-line options

`-l <zipfile>`

`--list <zipfile>`

    
List files in a zipfile.

`-c <zipfile> <source1> ... <sourceN>`

`--create <zipfile> <source1> ... <sourceN>`

    
Create zipfile from source files.

`-e <zipfile> <output_dir>`

`--extract <zipfile> <output_dir>`

    
Extract zipfile into target directory.

`-t <zipfile>`

`--test <zipfile>`

    
Test whether the zipfile is valid or not.

## Decompression pitfalls

The extraction in zipfile module might fail due to some pitfalls listed below.

### From file itself

Decompression may fail due to incorrect password / CRC checksum / ZIP format
or unsupported compression method / decryption.

### File System limitations

Exceeding limitations on different file systems can cause decompression
failed. Such as allowable characters in the directory entries, length of the
file name, length of the pathname, size of a single file, and number of files,
etc.

### Resources limitations

The lack of memory or disk volume would lead to decompression failed. For
example, decompression bombs (aka ZIP bomb) apply to zipfile library that can
cause disk volume exhaustion.

### Interruption

Interruption during the decompression, such as pressing control-C or killing
the decompression process may result in incomplete decompression of the
archive.

### Default behaviors of extraction

Not knowing the default extraction behaviors can cause unexpected
decompression results. For example, when extracting the same archive twice, it
overwrites files without asking.
