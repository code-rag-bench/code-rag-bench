# mimetypes — Map filenames to MIME types

Source code: Lib/mimetypes.py

The `mimetypes` module converts between a filename or URL and the MIME type
associated with the filename extension. Conversions are provided from filename
to MIME type and from MIME type to filename extension; encodings are not
supported for the latter conversion.

The module provides one class and a number of convenience functions. The
functions are the normal interface to this module, but some applications may
be interested in the class as well.

The functions described below provide the primary interface for this module.
If the module has not been initialized, they will call `init()` if they rely
on the information `init()` sets up.

`mimetypes.guess_type(url, strict=True)`

    
Guess the type of a file based on its filename, path or URL, given by url. URL
can be a string or a path-like object.

The return value is a tuple `(type, encoding)` where type is `None` if the
type can’t be guessed (missing or unknown suffix) or a string of the form
`'type/subtype'`, usable for a MIME content-type header.

encoding is `None` for no encoding or the name of the program used to encode
(e.g. compress or gzip). The encoding is suitable for use as a Content-
Encoding header, not as a Content-Transfer-Encoding header. The mappings are
table driven. Encoding suffixes are case sensitive; type suffixes are first
tried case sensitively, then case insensitively.

The optional strict argument is a flag specifying whether the list of known
MIME types is limited to only the official types registered with IANA. When
strict is `True` (the default), only the IANA types are supported; when strict
is `False`, some additional non-standard but commonly used MIME types are also
recognized.

Changed in version 3.8: Added support for url being a path-like object.

`mimetypes.guess_all_extensions(type, strict=True)`

    
Guess the extensions for a file based on its MIME type, given by type. The
return value is a list of strings giving all possible filename extensions,
including the leading dot (`'.'`). The extensions are not guaranteed to have
been associated with any particular data stream, but would be mapped to the
MIME type type by `guess_type()`.

The optional strict argument has the same meaning as with the `guess_type()`
function.

`mimetypes.guess_extension(type, strict=True)`

    
Guess the extension for a file based on its MIME type, given by type. The
return value is a string giving a filename extension, including the leading
dot (`'.'`). The extension is not guaranteed to have been associated with any
particular data stream, but would be mapped to the MIME type type by
`guess_type()`. If no extension can be guessed for type, `None` is returned.

The optional strict argument has the same meaning as with the `guess_type()`
function.

Some additional functions and data items are available for controlling the
behavior of the module.

`mimetypes.init(files=None)`

    
Initialize the internal data structures. If given, files must be a sequence of
file names which should be used to augment the default type map. If omitted,
the file names to use are taken from `knownfiles`; on Windows, the current
registry settings are loaded. Each file named in files or `knownfiles` takes
precedence over those named before it. Calling `init()` repeatedly is allowed.

Specifying an empty list for files will prevent the system defaults from being
applied: only the well-known values will be present from a built-in list.

If files is `None` the internal data structure is completely rebuilt to its
initial default value. This is a stable operation and will produce the same
results when called multiple times.

Changed in version 3.2: Previously, Windows registry settings were ignored.

`mimetypes.read_mime_types(filename)`

    
Load the type map given in the file filename, if it exists. The type map is
returned as a dictionary mapping filename extensions, including the leading
dot (`'.'`), to strings of the form `'type/subtype'`. If the file filename
does not exist or cannot be read, `None` is returned.

`mimetypes.add_type(type, ext, strict=True)`

    
Add a mapping from the MIME type type to the extension ext. When the extension
is already known, the new type will replace the old one. When the type is
already known the extension will be added to the list of known extensions.

When strict is `True` (the default), the mapping will be added to the official
MIME types, otherwise to the non-standard ones.

`mimetypes.inited`

    
Flag indicating whether or not the global data structures have been
initialized. This is set to `True` by `init()`.

`mimetypes.knownfiles`

    
List of type map file names commonly installed. These files are typically
named `mime.types` and are installed in different locations by different
packages.

`mimetypes.suffix_map`

    
Dictionary mapping suffixes to suffixes. This is used to allow recognition of
encoded files for which the encoding and the type are indicated by the same
extension. For example, the `.tgz` extension is mapped to `.tar.gz` to allow
the encoding and type to be recognized separately.

`mimetypes.encodings_map`

    
Dictionary mapping filename extensions to encoding types.

`mimetypes.types_map`

    
Dictionary mapping filename extensions to MIME types.

`mimetypes.common_types`

    
Dictionary mapping filename extensions to non-standard, but commonly found
MIME types.

An example usage of the module:

    
    >>> import mimetypes
    >>> mimetypes.init()
    >>> mimetypes.knownfiles
    ['/etc/mime.types', '/etc/httpd/mime.types', ... ]
    >>> mimetypes.suffix_map['.tgz']
    '.tar.gz'
    >>> mimetypes.encodings_map['.gz']
    'gzip'
    >>> mimetypes.types_map['.tgz']
    'application/x-tar-gz'
    
## MimeTypes Objects

The `MimeTypes` class may be useful for applications which may want more than
one MIME-type database; it provides an interface similar to the one of the
`mimetypes` module.

`class mimetypes.MimeTypes(filenames=(), strict=True)`

    
This class represents a MIME-types database. By default, it provides access to
the same database as the rest of this module. The initial database is a copy
of that provided by the module, and may be extended by loading additional
`mime.types`-style files into the database using the `read()` or `readfp()`
methods. The mapping dictionaries may also be cleared before loading
additional data if the default data is not desired.

The optional filenames parameter can be used to cause additional files to be
loaded “on top” of the default database.

`suffix_map`

    
Dictionary mapping suffixes to suffixes. This is used to allow recognition of
encoded files for which the encoding and the type are indicated by the same
extension. For example, the `.tgz` extension is mapped to `.tar.gz` to allow
the encoding and type to be recognized separately. This is initially a copy of
the global `suffix_map` defined in the module.

`encodings_map`

    
Dictionary mapping filename extensions to encoding types. This is initially a
copy of the global `encodings_map` defined in the module.

`types_map`

    
Tuple containing two dictionaries, mapping filename extensions to MIME types:
the first dictionary is for the non-standards types and the second one is for
the standard types. They are initialized by `common_types` and `types_map`.

`types_map_inv`

    
Tuple containing two dictionaries, mapping MIME types to a list of filename
extensions: the first dictionary is for the non-standards types and the second
one is for the standard types. They are initialized by `common_types` and
`types_map`.

`guess_extension(type, strict=True)`

    
Similar to the `guess_extension()` function, using the tables stored as part
of the object.

`guess_type(url, strict=True)`

    
Similar to the `guess_type()` function, using the tables stored as part of the
object.

`guess_all_extensions(type, strict=True)`

    
Similar to the `guess_all_extensions()` function, using the tables stored as
part of the object.

`read(filename, strict=True)`

    
Load MIME information from a file named filename. This uses `readfp()` to
parse the file.

If strict is `True`, information will be added to list of standard types, else
to the list of non-standard types.

`readfp(fp, strict=True)`

    
Load MIME type information from an open file fp. The file must have the format
of the standard `mime.types` files.

If strict is `True`, information will be added to the list of standard types,
else to the list of non-standard types.

`read_windows_registry(strict=True)`

    
Load MIME type information from the Windows registry.

Availability: Windows.

If strict is `True`, information will be added to the list of standard types,
else to the list of non-standard types.

New in version 3.2.
