# urllib.error — Exception classes raised by urllib.request

Source code: Lib/urllib/error.py

The `urllib.error` module defines the exception classes for exceptions raised
by `urllib.request`. The base exception class is `URLError`.

The following exceptions are raised by `urllib.error` as appropriate:

`exception urllib.error.URLError`

    
The handlers raise this exception (or derived exceptions) when they run into a
problem. It is a subclass of `OSError`.

`reason`

    
The reason for this error. It can be a message string or another exception
instance.

Changed in version 3.3: `URLError` has been made a subclass of `OSError`
instead of `IOError`.

`exception urllib.error.HTTPError`

    
Though being an exception (a subclass of `URLError`), an `HTTPError` can also
function as a non-exceptional file-like return value (the same thing that
`urlopen()` returns). This is useful when handling exotic HTTP errors, such as
requests for authentication.

`code`

    
An HTTP status code as defined in RFC 2616. This numeric value corresponds to
a value found in the dictionary of codes as found in
`http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.responses`.

`reason`

    
This is usually a string explaining the reason for this error.

`headers`

    
The HTTP response headers for the HTTP request that caused the `HTTPError`.

New in version 3.4.

`exception urllib.error.ContentTooShortError(msg, content)`

    
This exception is raised when the `urlretrieve()` function detects that the
amount of the downloaded data is less than the expected amount (given by the
Content-Length header). The `content` attribute stores the downloaded (and
supposedly truncated) data.
