# email — An email and MIME handling package

Source code: Lib/email/__init__.py

The `email` package is a library for managing email messages. It is
specifically not designed to do any sending of email messages to SMTP (RFC
2821), NNTP, or other servers; those are functions of modules such as
`smtplib` and `nntplib`. The `email` package attempts to be as RFC-compliant
as possible, supporting RFC 5322 and RFC 6532, as well as such MIME-related
RFCs as RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 2183, and RFC 2231.

The overall structure of the email package can be divided into three major
components, plus a fourth component that controls the behavior of the other
components.

The central component of the package is an “object model” that represents
email messages. An application interacts with the package primarily through
the object model interface defined in the `message` sub-module. The
application can use this API to ask questions about an existing email, to
construct a new email, or to add or remove email subcomponents that themselves
use the same object model interface. That is, following the nature of email
messages and their MIME subcomponents, the email object model is a tree
structure of objects that all provide the `EmailMessage` API.

The other two major components of the package are the `parser` and the
`generator`. The parser takes the serialized version of an email message (a
stream of bytes) and converts it into a tree of `EmailMessage` objects. The
generator takes an `EmailMessage` and turns it back into a serialized byte
stream. (The parser and generator also handle streams of text characters, but
this usage is discouraged as it is too easy to end up with messages that are
not valid in one way or another.)

The control component is the `policy` module. Every `EmailMessage`, every
`generator`, and every `parser` has an associated `policy` object that
controls its behavior. Usually an application only needs to specify the policy
when an `EmailMessage` is created, either by directly instantiating an
`EmailMessage` to create a new email, or by parsing an input stream using a
`parser`. But the policy can be changed when the message is serialized using a
`generator`. This allows, for example, a generic email message to be parsed
from disk, but to serialize it using standard SMTP settings when sending it to
an email server.

The email package does its best to hide the details of the various governing
RFCs from the application. Conceptually the application should be able to
treat the email message as a structured tree of unicode text and binary
attachments, without having to worry about how these are represented when
serialized. In practice, however, it is often necessary to be aware of at
least some of the rules governing MIME messages and their structure,
specifically the names and nature of the MIME “content types” and how they
identify multipart documents. For the most part this knowledge should only be
required for more complex applications, and even then it should only be the
high level structure in question, and not the details of how those structures
are represented. Since MIME content types are used widely in modern internet
software (not just email), this will be a familiar concept to many
programmers.

The following sections describe the functionality of the `email` package. We
start with the `message` object model, which is the primary interface an
application will use, and follow that with the `parser` and `generator`
components. Then we cover the `policy` controls, which completes the treatment
of the main components of the library.

The next three sections cover the exceptions the package may raise and the
defects (non-compliance with the RFCs) that the `parser` may detect. Then we
cover the `headerregistry` and the `contentmanager` sub-components, which
provide tools for doing more detailed manipulation of headers and payloads,
respectively. Both of these components contain features relevant to consuming
and producing non-trivial messages, but also document their extensibility
APIs, which will be of interest to advanced applications.

Following those is a set of examples of using the fundamental parts of the
APIs covered in the preceding sections.

The foregoing represent the modern (unicode friendly) API of the email
package. The remaining sections, starting with the `Message` class, cover the
legacy `compat32` API that deals much more directly with the details of how
email messages are represented. The `compat32` API does not hide the details
of the RFCs from the application, but for applications that need to operate at
that level, they can be useful tools. This documentation is also relevant for
applications that are still using the `compat32` API for backward
compatibility reasons.

Changed in version 3.6: Docs reorganized and rewritten to promote the new
`EmailMessage`/`EmailPolicy` API.
