# locale — Internationalization services

Source code: Lib/locale.py

The `locale` module opens access to the POSIX locale database and
functionality. The POSIX locale mechanism allows programmers to deal with
certain cultural issues in an application, without requiring the programmer to
know all the specifics of each country where the software is executed.

The `locale` module is implemented on top of the `_locale` module, which in
turn uses an ANSI C locale implementation if available.

The `locale` module defines the following exception and functions:

`exception locale.Error`

    
Exception raised when the locale passed to `setlocale()` is not recognized.

`locale.setlocale(category, locale=None)`

    
If locale is given and not `None`, `setlocale()` modifies the locale setting
for the category. The available categories are listed in the data description
below. locale may be a string, or an iterable of two strings (language code
and encoding). If it’s an iterable, it’s converted to a locale name using the
locale aliasing engine. An empty string specifies the user’s default settings.
If the modification of the locale fails, the exception `Error` is raised. If
successful, the new locale setting is returned.

If locale is omitted or `None`, the current setting for category is returned.

`setlocale()` is not thread-safe on most systems. Applications typically start
with a call of

    
    import locale
    locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, '')
    
This sets the locale for all categories to the user’s default setting
(typically specified in the `LANG` environment variable). If the locale is not
changed thereafter, using multithreading should not cause problems.

`locale.localeconv()`

    
Returns the database of the local conventions as a dictionary. This dictionary
has the following strings as keys:

Category | Key | Meaning  
---|---|---  
`LC_NUMERIC` | `'decimal_point'` | Decimal point character.  
| `'grouping'` | Sequence of numbers specifying which relative positions the `'thousands_sep'` is expected. If the sequence is terminated with `CHAR_MAX`, no further grouping is performed. If the sequence terminates with a `0`, the last group size is repeatedly used.  
| `'thousands_sep'` | Character used between groups.  
`LC_MONETARY` | `'int_curr_symbol'` | International currency symbol.  
| `'currency_symbol'` | Local currency symbol.  
| `'p_cs_precedes/n_cs_precedes'` | Whether the currency symbol precedes the value (for positive resp. negative values).  
| `'p_sep_by_space/n_sep_by_space'` | Whether the currency symbol is separated from the value by a space (for positive resp. negative values).  
| `'mon_decimal_point'` | Decimal point used for monetary values.  
| `'frac_digits'` | Number of fractional digits used in local formatting of monetary values.  
| `'int_frac_digits'` | Number of fractional digits used in international formatting of monetary values.  
| `'mon_thousands_sep'` | Group separator used for monetary values.  
| `'mon_grouping'` | Equivalent to `'grouping'`, used for monetary values.  
| `'positive_sign'` | Symbol used to annotate a positive monetary value.  
| `'negative_sign'` | Symbol used to annotate a negative monetary value.  
| `'p_sign_posn/n_sign_posn'` | The position of the sign (for positive resp. negative values), see below.  
All numeric values can be set to `CHAR_MAX` to indicate that there is no value
specified in this locale.

The possible values for `'p_sign_posn'` and `'n_sign_posn'` are given below.

Value | Explanation  
---|---  
`0` | Currency and value are surrounded by parentheses.  
`1` | The sign should precede the value and currency symbol.  
`2` | The sign should follow the value and currency symbol.  
`3` | The sign should immediately precede the value.  
`4` | The sign should immediately follow the value.  
`CHAR_MAX` | Nothing is specified in this locale.  
The function sets temporarily the `LC_CTYPE` locale to the `LC_NUMERIC` locale
or the `LC_MONETARY` locale if locales are different and numeric or monetary
strings are non-ASCII. This temporary change affects other threads.

Changed in version 3.7: The function now sets temporarily the `LC_CTYPE`
locale to the `LC_NUMERIC` locale in some cases.

`locale.nl_langinfo(option)`

    
Return some locale-specific information as a string. This function is not
available on all systems, and the set of possible options might also vary
across platforms. The possible argument values are numbers, for which symbolic
constants are available in the locale module.

The `nl_langinfo()` function accepts one of the following keys. Most
descriptions are taken from the corresponding description in the GNU C
library.

`locale.CODESET`

    
Get a string with the name of the character encoding used in the selected
locale.

`locale.D_T_FMT`

    
Get a string that can be used as a format string for `time.strftime()` to
represent date and time in a locale-specific way.

`locale.D_FMT`

    
Get a string that can be used as a format string for `time.strftime()` to
represent a date in a locale-specific way.

`locale.T_FMT`

    
Get a string that can be used as a format string for `time.strftime()` to
represent a time in a locale-specific way.

`locale.T_FMT_AMPM`

    
Get a format string for `time.strftime()` to represent time in the am/pm
format.

`DAY_1 ... DAY_7`

    
Get the name of the n-th day of the week.

Note

This follows the US convention of `DAY_1` being Sunday, not the international
convention (ISO 8601) that Monday is the first day of the week.

`ABDAY_1 ... ABDAY_7`

    
Get the abbreviated name of the n-th day of the week.

`MON_1 ... MON_12`

    
Get the name of the n-th month.

`ABMON_1 ... ABMON_12`

    
Get the abbreviated name of the n-th month.

`locale.RADIXCHAR`

    
Get the radix character (decimal dot, decimal comma, etc.).

`locale.THOUSEP`

    
Get the separator character for thousands (groups of three digits).

`locale.YESEXPR`

    
Get a regular expression that can be used with the regex function to recognize
a positive response to a yes/no question.

Note

The expression is in the syntax suitable for the `regex()` function from the C
library, which might differ from the syntax used in `re`.

`locale.NOEXPR`

    
Get a regular expression that can be used with the regex(3) function to
recognize a negative response to a yes/no question.

`locale.CRNCYSTR`

    
Get the currency symbol, preceded by “-” if the symbol should appear before
the value, “+” if the symbol should appear after the value, or “.” if the
symbol should replace the radix character.

`locale.ERA`

    
Get a string that represents the era used in the current locale.

Most locales do not define this value. An example of a locale which does
define this value is the Japanese one. In Japan, the traditional
representation of dates includes the name of the era corresponding to the
then-emperor’s reign.

Normally it should not be necessary to use this value directly. Specifying the
`E` modifier in their format strings causes the `time.strftime()` function to
use this information. The format of the returned string is not specified, and
therefore you should not assume knowledge of it on different systems.

`locale.ERA_D_T_FMT`

    
Get a format string for `time.strftime()` to represent date and time in a
locale-specific era-based way.

`locale.ERA_D_FMT`

    
Get a format string for `time.strftime()` to represent a date in a locale-
specific era-based way.

`locale.ERA_T_FMT`

    
Get a format string for `time.strftime()` to represent a time in a locale-
specific era-based way.

`locale.ALT_DIGITS`

    
Get a representation of up to 100 values used to represent the values 0 to 99.

`locale.getdefaultlocale([envvars])`

    
Tries to determine the default locale settings and returns them as a tuple of
the form `(language code, encoding)`.

According to POSIX, a program which has not called `setlocale(LC_ALL, '')`
runs using the portable `'C'` locale. Calling `setlocale(LC_ALL, '')` lets it
use the default locale as defined by the `LANG` variable. Since we do not want
to interfere with the current locale setting we thus emulate the behavior in
the way described above.

To maintain compatibility with other platforms, not only the `LANG` variable
is tested, but a list of variables given as envvars parameter. The first found
to be defined will be used. envvars defaults to the search path used in GNU
gettext; it must always contain the variable name `'LANG'`. The GNU gettext
search path contains `'LC_ALL'`, `'LC_CTYPE'`, `'LANG'` and `'LANGUAGE'`, in
that order.

Except for the code `'C'`, the language code corresponds to RFC 1766. language
code and encoding may be `None` if their values cannot be determined.

`locale.getlocale(category=LC_CTYPE)`

    
Returns the current setting for the given locale category as sequence
containing language code, encoding. category may be one of the `LC_*` values
except `LC_ALL`. It defaults to `LC_CTYPE`.

Except for the code `'C'`, the language code corresponds to RFC 1766. language
code and encoding may be `None` if their values cannot be determined.

`locale.getpreferredencoding(do_setlocale=True)`

    
Return the encoding used for text data, according to user preferences. User
preferences are expressed differently on different systems, and might not be
available programmatically on some systems, so this function only returns a
guess.

On some systems, it is necessary to invoke `setlocale()` to obtain the user
preferences, so this function is not thread-safe. If invoking setlocale is not
necessary or desired, do_setlocale should be set to `False`.

On Android or in the UTF-8 mode (`-X` `utf8` option), always return `'UTF-8'`,
the locale and the do_setlocale argument are ignored.

Changed in version 3.7: The function now always returns `UTF-8` on Android or
if the UTF-8 mode is enabled.

`locale.normalize(localename)`

    
Returns a normalized locale code for the given locale name. The returned
locale code is formatted for use with `setlocale()`. If normalization fails,
the original name is returned unchanged.

If the given encoding is not known, the function defaults to the default
encoding for the locale code just like `setlocale()`.

`locale.resetlocale(category=LC_ALL)`

    
Sets the locale for category to the default setting.

The default setting is determined by calling `getdefaultlocale()`. category
defaults to `LC_ALL`.

`locale.strcoll(string1, string2)`

    
Compares two strings according to the current `LC_COLLATE` setting. As any
other compare function, returns a negative, or a positive value, or `0`,
depending on whether string1 collates before or after string2 or is equal to
it.

`locale.strxfrm(string)`

    
Transforms a string to one that can be used in locale-aware comparisons. For
example, `strxfrm(s1) < strxfrm(s2)` is equivalent to `strcoll(s1, s2) < 0`.
This function can be used when the same string is compared repeatedly, e.g.
when collating a sequence of strings.

`locale.format_string(format, val, grouping=False, monetary=False)`

    
Formats a number val according to the current `LC_NUMERIC` setting. The format
follows the conventions of the `%` operator. For floating point values, the
decimal point is modified if appropriate. If grouping is true, also takes the
grouping into account.

If monetary is true, the conversion uses monetary thousands separator and
grouping strings.

Processes formatting specifiers as in `format % val`, but takes the current
locale settings into account.

Changed in version 3.7: The monetary keyword parameter was added.

`locale.format(format, val, grouping=False, monetary=False)`

    
Please note that this function works like `format_string()` but will only work
for exactly one `%char` specifier. For example, `'%f'` and `'%.0f'` are both
valid specifiers, but `'%f KiB'` is not.

For whole format strings, use `format_string()`.

Deprecated since version 3.7: Use `format_string()` instead.

`locale.currency(val, symbol=True, grouping=False, international=False)`

    
Formats a number val according to the current `LC_MONETARY` settings.

The returned string includes the currency symbol if symbol is true, which is
the default. If grouping is true (which is not the default), grouping is done
with the value. If international is true (which is not the default), the
international currency symbol is used.

Note that this function will not work with the ‘C’ locale, so you have to set
a locale via `setlocale()` first.

`locale.str(float)`

    
Formats a floating point number using the same format as the built-in function
`str(float)`, but takes the decimal point into account.

`locale.delocalize(string)`

    
Converts a string into a normalized number string, following the `LC_NUMERIC`
settings.

New in version 3.5.

`locale.atof(string)`

    
Converts a string to a floating point number, following the `LC_NUMERIC`
settings.

`locale.atoi(string)`

    
Converts a string to an integer, following the `LC_NUMERIC` conventions.

`locale.LC_CTYPE`

    
Locale category for the character type functions. Depending on the settings of
this category, the functions of module `string` dealing with case change their
behaviour.

`locale.LC_COLLATE`

    
Locale category for sorting strings. The functions `strcoll()` and `strxfrm()`
of the `locale` module are affected.

`locale.LC_TIME`

    
Locale category for the formatting of time. The function `time.strftime()`
follows these conventions.

`locale.LC_MONETARY`

    
Locale category for formatting of monetary values. The available options are
available from the `localeconv()` function.

`locale.LC_MESSAGES`

    
Locale category for message display. Python currently does not support
application specific locale-aware messages. Messages displayed by the
operating system, like those returned by `os.strerror()` might be affected by
this category.

`locale.LC_NUMERIC`

    
Locale category for formatting numbers. The functions `format()`, `atoi()`,
`atof()` and `str()` of the `locale` module are affected by that category. All
other numeric formatting operations are not affected.

`locale.LC_ALL`

    
Combination of all locale settings. If this flag is used when the locale is
changed, setting the locale for all categories is attempted. If that fails for
any category, no category is changed at all. When the locale is retrieved
using this flag, a string indicating the setting for all categories is
returned. This string can be later used to restore the settings.

`locale.CHAR_MAX`

    
This is a symbolic constant used for different values returned by
`localeconv()`.

Example:

    
    >>> import locale
    >>> loc = locale.getlocale()  # get current locale
    # use German locale; name might vary with platform
    >>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'de_DE')
    >>> locale.strcoll('f\xe4n', 'foo')  # compare a string containing an umlaut
    >>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, '')   # use user's preferred locale
    >>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'C')  # use default (C) locale
    >>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, loc)  # restore saved locale
    
## Background, details, hints, tips and caveats

The C standard defines the locale as a program-wide property that may be
relatively expensive to change. On top of that, some implementation are broken
in such a way that frequent locale changes may cause core dumps. This makes
the locale somewhat painful to use correctly.

Initially, when a program is started, the locale is the `C` locale, no matter
what the user’s preferred locale is. There is one exception: the `LC_CTYPE`
category is changed at startup to set the current locale encoding to the
user’s preferred locale encoding. The program must explicitly say that it
wants the user’s preferred locale settings for other categories by calling
`setlocale(LC_ALL, '')`.

It is generally a bad idea to call `setlocale()` in some library routine,
since as a side effect it affects the entire program. Saving and restoring it
is almost as bad: it is expensive and affects other threads that happen to run
before the settings have been restored.

If, when coding a module for general use, you need a locale independent
version of an operation that is affected by the locale (such as certain
formats used with `time.strftime()`), you will have to find a way to do it
without using the standard library routine. Even better is convincing yourself
that using locale settings is okay. Only as a last resort should you document
that your module is not compatible with non-`C` locale settings.

The only way to perform numeric operations according to the locale is to use
the special functions defined by this module: `atof()`, `atoi()`, `format()`,
`str()`.

There is no way to perform case conversions and character classifications
according to the locale. For (Unicode) text strings these are done according
to the character value only, while for byte strings, the conversions and
classifications are done according to the ASCII value of the byte, and bytes
whose high bit is set (i.e., non-ASCII bytes) are never converted or
considered part of a character class such as letter or whitespace.

## For extension writers and programs that embed Python

Extension modules should never call `setlocale()`, except to find out what the
current locale is. But since the return value can only be used portably to
restore it, that is not very useful (except perhaps to find out whether or not
the locale is `C`).

When Python code uses the `locale` module to change the locale, this also
affects the embedding application. If the embedding application doesn’t want
this to happen, it should remove the `_locale` extension module (which does
all the work) from the table of built-in modules in the `config.c` file, and
make sure that the `_locale` module is not accessible as a shared library.

## Access to message catalogs

`locale.gettext(msg)`

`locale.dgettext(domain, msg)`

`locale.dcgettext(domain, msg, category)`

`locale.textdomain(domain)`

`locale.bindtextdomain(domain, dir)`

The locale module exposes the C library’s gettext interface on systems that
provide this interface. It consists of the functions `gettext()`,
`dgettext()`, `dcgettext()`, `textdomain()`, `bindtextdomain()`, and
`bind_textdomain_codeset()`. These are similar to the same functions in the
`gettext` module, but use the C library’s binary format for message catalogs,
and the C library’s search algorithms for locating message catalogs.

Python applications should normally find no need to invoke these functions,
and should use `gettext` instead. A known exception to this rule are
applications that link with additional C libraries which internally invoke
`gettext()` or `dcgettext()`. For these applications, it may be necessary to
bind the text domain, so that the libraries can properly locate their message
catalogs.
