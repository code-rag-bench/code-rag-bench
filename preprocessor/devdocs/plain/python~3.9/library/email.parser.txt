# email.parser: Parsing email messages

Source code: Lib/email/parser.py

Message object structures can be created in one of two ways: they can be
created from whole cloth by creating an `EmailMessage` object, adding headers
using the dictionary interface, and adding payload(s) using `set_content()`
and related methods, or they can be created by parsing a serialized
representation of the email message.

The `email` package provides a standard parser that understands most email
document structures, including MIME documents. You can pass the parser a
bytes, string or file object, and the parser will return to you the root
`EmailMessage` instance of the object structure. For simple, non-MIME messages
the payload of this root object will likely be a string containing the text of
the message. For MIME messages, the root object will return `True` from its
`is_multipart()` method, and the subparts can be accessed via the payload
manipulation methods, such as `get_body()`, `iter_parts()`, and `walk()`.

There are actually two parser interfaces available for use, the `Parser` API
and the incremental `FeedParser` API. The `Parser` API is most useful if you
have the entire text of the message in memory, or if the entire message lives
in a file on the file system. `FeedParser` is more appropriate when you are
reading the message from a stream which might block waiting for more input
(such as reading an email message from a socket). The `FeedParser` can consume
and parse the message incrementally, and only returns the root object when you
close the parser.

Note that the parser can be extended in limited ways, and of course you can
implement your own parser completely from scratch. All of the logic that
connects the `email` package’s bundled parser and the `EmailMessage` class is
embodied in the `policy` class, so a custom parser can create message object
trees any way it finds necessary by implementing custom versions of the
appropriate `policy` methods.

## FeedParser API

The `BytesFeedParser`, imported from the `email.feedparser` module, provides
an API that is conducive to incremental parsing of email messages, such as
would be necessary when reading the text of an email message from a source
that can block (such as a socket). The `BytesFeedParser` can of course be used
to parse an email message fully contained in a bytes-like object, string, or
file, but the `BytesParser` API may be more convenient for such use cases. The
semantics and results of the two parser APIs are identical.

The `BytesFeedParser`’s API is simple; you create an instance, feed it a bunch
of bytes until there’s no more to feed it, then close the parser to retrieve
the root message object. The `BytesFeedParser` is extremely accurate when
parsing standards-compliant messages, and it does a very good job of parsing
non-compliant messages, providing information about how a message was deemed
broken. It will populate a message object’s `defects` attribute with a list of
any problems it found in a message. See the `email.errors` module for the list
of defects that it can find.

Here is the API for the `BytesFeedParser`:

`class email.parser.BytesFeedParser(_factory=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)`

    
Create a `BytesFeedParser` instance. Optional _factory is a no-argument
callable; if not specified use the `message_factory` from the policy. Call
_factory whenever a new message object is needed.

If policy is specified use the rules it specifies to update the representation
of the message. If policy is not set, use the `compat32` policy, which
maintains backward compatibility with the Python 3.2 version of the email
package and provides `Message` as the default factory. All other policies
provide `EmailMessage` as the default _factory. For more information on what
else policy controls, see the `policy` documentation.

Note: The policy keyword should always be specified; The default will change
to `email.policy.default` in a future version of Python.

New in version 3.2.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the policy keyword.

Changed in version 3.6: _factory defaults to the policy `message_factory`.

`feed(data)`

    
Feed the parser some more data. data should be a bytes-like object containing
one or more lines. The lines can be partial and the parser will stitch such
partial lines together properly. The lines can have any of the three common
line endings: carriage return, newline, or carriage return and newline (they
can even be mixed).

`close()`

    
Complete the parsing of all previously fed data and return the root message
object. It is undefined what happens if `feed()` is called after this method
has been called.

`class email.parser.FeedParser(_factory=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)`

    
Works like `BytesFeedParser` except that the input to the `feed()` method must
be a string. This is of limited utility, since the only way for such a message
to be valid is for it to contain only ASCII text or, if `utf8` is `True`, no
binary attachments.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the policy keyword.

## Parser API

The `BytesParser` class, imported from the `email.parser` module, provides an
API that can be used to parse a message when the complete contents of the
message are available in a bytes-like object or file. The `email.parser`
module also provides `Parser` for parsing strings, and header-only parsers,
`BytesHeaderParser` and `HeaderParser`, which can be used if you’re only
interested in the headers of the message. `BytesHeaderParser` and
`HeaderParser` can be much faster in these situations, since they do not
attempt to parse the message body, instead setting the payload to the raw
body.

`class email.parser.BytesParser(_class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)`

    
Create a `BytesParser` instance. The _class and policy arguments have the same
meaning and semantics as the _factory and policy arguments of
`BytesFeedParser`.

Note: The policy keyword should always be specified; The default will change
to `email.policy.default` in a future version of Python.

Changed in version 3.3: Removed the strict argument that was deprecated in
2.4. Added the policy keyword.

Changed in version 3.6: _class defaults to the policy `message_factory`.

`parse(fp, headersonly=False)`

    
Read all the data from the binary file-like object fp, parse the resulting
bytes, and return the message object. fp must support both the `readline()`
and the `read()` methods.

The bytes contained in fp must be formatted as a block of RFC 5322 (or, if
`utf8` is `True`, RFC 6532) style headers and header continuation lines,
optionally preceded by an envelope header. The header block is terminated
either by the end of the data or by a blank line. Following the header block
is the body of the message (which may contain MIME-encoded subparts, including
subparts with a Content-Transfer-Encoding of `8bit`).

Optional headersonly is a flag specifying whether to stop parsing after
reading the headers or not. The default is `False`, meaning it parses the
entire contents of the file.

`parsebytes(bytes, headersonly=False)`

    
Similar to the `parse()` method, except it takes a bytes-like object instead
of a file-like object. Calling this method on a bytes-like object is
equivalent to wrapping bytes in a `BytesIO` instance first and calling
`parse()`.

Optional headersonly is as with the `parse()` method.

New in version 3.2.

`class email.parser.BytesHeaderParser(_class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)`

    
Exactly like `BytesParser`, except that headersonly defaults to `True`.

New in version 3.3.

`class email.parser.Parser(_class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)`

    
This class is parallel to `BytesParser`, but handles string input.

Changed in version 3.3: Removed the strict argument. Added the policy keyword.

Changed in version 3.6: _class defaults to the policy `message_factory`.

`parse(fp, headersonly=False)`

    
Read all the data from the text-mode file-like object fp, parse the resulting
text, and return the root message object. fp must support both the
`readline()` and the `read()` methods on file-like objects.

Other than the text mode requirement, this method operates like
`BytesParser.parse()`.

`parsestr(text, headersonly=False)`

    
Similar to the `parse()` method, except it takes a string object instead of a
file-like object. Calling this method on a string is equivalent to wrapping
text in a `StringIO` instance first and calling `parse()`.

Optional headersonly is as with the `parse()` method.

`class email.parser.HeaderParser(_class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)`

    
Exactly like `Parser`, except that headersonly defaults to `True`.

Since creating a message object structure from a string or a file object is
such a common task, four functions are provided as a convenience. They are
available in the top-level `email` package namespace.

`email.message_from_bytes(s, _class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)`

    
Return a message object structure from a bytes-like object. This is equivalent
to `BytesParser().parsebytes(s)`. Optional _class and policy are interpreted
as with the `BytesParser` class constructor.

New in version 3.2.

Changed in version 3.3: Removed the strict argument. Added the policy keyword.

`email.message_from_binary_file(fp, _class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)`

    
Return a message object structure tree from an open binary file object. This
is equivalent to `BytesParser().parse(fp)`. _class and policy are interpreted
as with the `BytesParser` class constructor.

New in version 3.2.

Changed in version 3.3: Removed the strict argument. Added the policy keyword.

`email.message_from_string(s, _class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)`

    
Return a message object structure from a string. This is equivalent to
`Parser().parsestr(s)`. _class and policy are interpreted as with the `Parser`
class constructor.

Changed in version 3.3: Removed the strict argument. Added the policy keyword.

`email.message_from_file(fp, _class=None, *, policy=policy.compat32)`

    
Return a message object structure tree from an open file object. This is
equivalent to `Parser().parse(fp)`. _class and policy are interpreted as with
the `Parser` class constructor.

Changed in version 3.3: Removed the strict argument. Added the policy keyword.

Changed in version 3.6: _class defaults to the policy `message_factory`.

Here’s an example of how you might use `message_from_bytes()` at an
interactive Python prompt:

    
    >>> import email
    >>> msg = email.message_from_bytes(myBytes)  
    
## Additional notes

Here are some notes on the parsing semantics:

  * Most non-multipart type messages are parsed as a single message object with a string payload. These objects will return `False` for `is_multipart()`, and `iter_parts()` will yield an empty list.
  * All multipart type messages will be parsed as a container message object with a list of sub-message objects for their payload. The outer container message will return `True` for `is_multipart()`, and `iter_parts()` will yield a list of subparts.
  * Most messages with a content type of message/* (such as message/delivery-status and message/rfc822) will also be parsed as container object containing a list payload of length 1. Their `is_multipart()` method will return `True`. The single element yielded by `iter_parts()` will be a sub-message object.
  * Some non-standards-compliant messages may not be internally consistent about their multipart-edness. Such messages may have a Content-Type header of type multipart, but their `is_multipart()` method may return `False`. If such messages were parsed with the `FeedParser`, they will have an instance of the `MultipartInvariantViolationDefect` class in their defects attribute list. See `email.errors` for details.
