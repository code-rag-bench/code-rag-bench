# __main__ — Top-level script environment

`'__main__'` is the name of the scope in which top-level code executes. A
module’s __name__ is set equal to `'__main__'` when read from standard input,
a script, or from an interactive prompt.

A module can discover whether or not it is running in the main scope by
checking its own `__name__`, which allows a common idiom for conditionally
executing code in a module when it is run as a script or with `python -m` but
not when it is imported:

    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # execute only if run as a script
        main()
    
For a package, the same effect can be achieved by including a `__main__.py`
module, the contents of which will be executed when the module is run with
`-m`.
