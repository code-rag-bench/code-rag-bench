# Built-in Types

The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the
interpreter.

The principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes,
instances and exceptions.

Some collection classes are mutable. The methods that add, subtract, or
rearrange their members in place, and don’t return a specific item, never
return the collection instance itself but `None`.

Some operations are supported by several object types; in particular,
practically all objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth value,
and converted to a string (with the `repr()` function or the slightly
different `str()` function). The latter function is implicitly used when an
object is written by the `print()` function.

## Truth Value Testing

Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an `if` or `while`
condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.

By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a
`__bool__()` method that returns `False` or a `__len__()` method that returns
zero, when called with the object. 1 Here are most of the built-in objects
considered false:

  * constants defined to be false: `None` and `False`.
  * zero of any numeric type: `0`, `0.0`, `0j`, `Decimal(0)`, `Fraction(0, 1)`
  * empty sequences and collections: `''`, `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `set()`, `range(0)`

Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return `0`
or `False` for false and `1` or `True` for true, unless otherwise stated.
(Important exception: the Boolean operations `or` and `and` always return one
of their operands.)

## Boolean Operations — `and`, `or`, `not`

These are the Boolean operations, ordered by ascending priority:

Operation | Result | Notes  
---|---|---  
`x or y` | if x is false, then y, else x | (1)  
`x and y` | if x is false, then x, else y | (2)  
`not x` | if x is false, then `True`, else `False` | (3)  
Notes:

  1. This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is false.
  2. This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is true.
  3. `not` has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators, so `not a == b` is interpreted as `not (a == b)`, and `a == not b` is a syntax error.

## Comparisons

There are eight comparison operations in Python. They all have the same
priority (which is higher than that of the Boolean operations). Comparisons
can be chained arbitrarily; for example, `x < y <= z` is equivalent to `x < y
and y <= z`, except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not
evaluated at all when `x < y` is found to be false).

This table summarizes the comparison operations:

Operation | Meaning  
---|---  
`<` | strictly less than  
`<=` | less than or equal  
`>` | strictly greater than  
`>=` | greater than or equal  
`==` | equal  
`!=` | not equal  
`is` | object identity  
`is not` | negated object identity  
Objects of different types, except different numeric types, never compare
equal. The `==` operator is always defined but for some object types (for
example, class objects) is equivalent to `is`. The `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=`
operators are only defined where they make sense; for example, they raise a
`TypeError` exception when one of the arguments is a complex number.

Non-identical instances of a class normally compare as non-equal unless the
class defines the `__eq__()` method.

Instances of a class cannot be ordered with respect to other instances of the
same class, or other types of object, unless the class defines enough of the
methods `__lt__()`, `__le__()`, `__gt__()`, and `__ge__()` (in general,
`__lt__()` and `__eq__()` are sufficient, if you want the conventional
meanings of the comparison operators).

The behavior of the `is` and `is not` operators cannot be customized; also
they can be applied to any two objects and never raise an exception.

Two more operations with the same syntactic priority, `in` and `not in`, are
supported by types that are iterable or implement the `__contains__()` method.

## Numeric Types — int, float, complex

There are three distinct numeric types: integers, floating point numbers, and
complex numbers. In addition, Booleans are a subtype of integers. Integers
have unlimited precision. Floating point numbers are usually implemented using
`double` in C; information about the precision and internal representation of
floating point numbers for the machine on which your program is running is
available in `sys.float_info`. Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part,
which are each a floating point number. To extract these parts from a complex
number z, use `z.real` and `z.imag`. (The standard library includes the
additional numeric types `fractions.Fraction`, for rationals, and
`decimal.Decimal`, for floating-point numbers with user-definable precision.)

Numbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions
and operators. Unadorned integer literals (including hex, octal and binary
numbers) yield integers. Numeric literals containing a decimal point or an
exponent sign yield floating point numbers. Appending `'j'` or `'J'` to a
numeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real
part) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with
real and imaginary parts.

Python fully supports mixed arithmetic: when a binary arithmetic operator has
operands of different numeric types, the operand with the “narrower” type is
widened to that of the other, where integer is narrower than floating point,
which is narrower than complex. A comparison between numbers of different
types behaves as though the exact values of those numbers were being compared.
2

The constructors `int()`, `float()`, and `complex()` can be used to produce
numbers of a specific type.

All numeric types (except complex) support the following operations (for
priorities of the operations, see Operator precedence):

Operation | Result | Notes | Full documentation  
---|---|---|---  
`x + y` | sum of x and y |  |   
`x - y` | difference of x and y |  |   
`x * y` | product of x and y |  |   
`x / y` | quotient of x and y |  |   
`x // y` | floored quotient of x and y | (1) |   
`x % y` | remainder of `x / y` | (2) |   
`-x` | x negated |  |   
`+x` | x unchanged |  |   
`abs(x)` | absolute value or magnitude of x |  | `abs()`  
`int(x)` | x converted to integer | (3)(6) | `int()`  
`float(x)` | x converted to floating point | (4)(6) | `float()`  
`complex(re, im)` | a complex number with real part re, imaginary part im. im defaults to zero. | (6) | `complex()`  
`c.conjugate()` | conjugate of the complex number c |  |   
`divmod(x, y)` | the pair `(x // y, x % y)` | (2) | `divmod()`  
`pow(x, y)` | x to the power y | (5) | `pow()`  
`x ** y` | x to the power y | (5) |   
Notes:

  1. Also referred to as integer division. The resultant value is a whole integer, though the result’s type is not necessarily int. The result is always rounded towards minus infinity: `1//2` is `0`, `(-1)//2` is `-1`, `1//(-2)` is `-1`, and `(-1)//(-2)` is `0`.
  2. Not for complex numbers. Instead convert to floats using `abs()` if appropriate.
  3. Conversion from floating point to integer may round or truncate as in C; see functions `math.floor()` and `math.ceil()` for well-defined conversions. 
  4. float also accepts the strings “nan” and “inf” with an optional prefix “+” or “-” for Not a Number (NaN) and positive or negative infinity.
  5. Python defines `pow(0, 0)` and `0 ** 0` to be `1`, as is common for programming languages.
  6. The numeric literals accepted include the digits `0` to `9` or any Unicode equivalent (code points with the `Nd` property).
See https://www.unicode.org/Public/13.0.0/ucd/extracted/DerivedNumericType.txt
for a complete list of code points with the `Nd` property.

All `numbers.Real` types (`int` and `float`) also include the following
operations:

Operation | Result  
---|---  
`math.trunc(x)` | x truncated to `Integral`  
`round(x[, n])` | x rounded to n digits, rounding half to even. If n is omitted, it defaults to 0.  
`math.floor(x)` | the greatest `Integral` <= x  
`math.ceil(x)` | the least `Integral` >= x  
For additional numeric operations see the `math` and `cmath` modules.

### Bitwise Operations on Integer Types

Bitwise operations only make sense for integers. The result of bitwise
operations is calculated as though carried out in two’s complement with an
infinite number of sign bits.

The priorities of the binary bitwise operations are all lower than the numeric
operations and higher than the comparisons; the unary operation `~` has the
same priority as the other unary numeric operations (`+` and `-`).

This table lists the bitwise operations sorted in ascending priority:

Operation | Result | Notes  
---|---|---  
`x | y` | bitwise or of x and y | (4)  
`x ^ y` | bitwise exclusive or of x and y | (4)  
`x & y` | bitwise and of x and y | (4)  
`x << n` | x shifted left by n bits | (1)(2)  
`x >> n` | x shifted right by n bits | (1)(3)  
`~x` | the bits of x inverted |   
Notes:

  1. Negative shift counts are illegal and cause a `ValueError` to be raised.
  2. A left shift by n bits is equivalent to multiplication by `pow(2, n)`.
  3. A right shift by n bits is equivalent to floor division by `pow(2, n)`.
  4. Performing these calculations with at least one extra sign extension bit in a finite two’s complement representation (a working bit-width of `1 + max(x.bit_length(), y.bit_length())` or more) is sufficient to get the same result as if there were an infinite number of sign bits.

### Additional Methods on Integer Types

The int type implements the `numbers.Integral` abstract base class. In
addition, it provides a few more methods:

`int.bit_length()`

    
Return the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary,
excluding the sign and leading zeros:

    
    >>> n = -37
    >>> bin(n)
    '-0b100101'
    >>> n.bit_length()
    6
    
More precisely, if `x` is nonzero, then `x.bit_length()` is the unique
positive integer `k` such that `2**(k-1) <= abs(x) < 2**k`. Equivalently, when
`abs(x)` is small enough to have a correctly rounded logarithm, then `k = 1 +
int(log(abs(x), 2))`. If `x` is zero, then `x.bit_length()` returns `0`.

Equivalent to:

    
    def bit_length(self):
        s = bin(self)       # binary representation:  bin(-37) --> '-0b100101'
        s = s.lstrip('-0b') # remove leading zeros and minus sign
        return len(s)       # len('100101') --> 6
    
New in version 3.1.

`int.to_bytes(length, byteorder, *, signed=False)`

    
Return an array of bytes representing an integer.

    
    >>> (1024).to_bytes(2, byteorder='big')
    b'\x04\x00'
    >>> (1024).to_bytes(10, byteorder='big')
    b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x04\x00'
    >>> (-1024).to_bytes(10, byteorder='big', signed=True)
    b'\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfc\x00'
    >>> x = 1000
    >>> x.to_bytes((x.bit_length() + 7) // 8, byteorder='little')
    b'\xe8\x03'
    
The integer is represented using length bytes. An `OverflowError` is raised if
the integer is not representable with the given number of bytes.

The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the
integer. If byteorder is `"big"`, the most significant byte is at the
beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is `"little"`, the most significant
byte is at the end of the byte array. To request the native byte order of the
host system, use `sys.byteorder` as the byte order value.

The signed argument determines whether two’s complement is used to represent
the integer. If signed is `False` and a negative integer is given, an
`OverflowError` is raised. The default value for signed is `False`.

New in version 3.2.

`classmethod int.from_bytes(bytes, byteorder, *, signed=False)`

    
Return the integer represented by the given array of bytes.

    
    >>> int.from_bytes(b'\x00\x10', byteorder='big')
    16
    >>> int.from_bytes(b'\x00\x10', byteorder='little')
    4096
    >>> int.from_bytes(b'\xfc\x00', byteorder='big', signed=True)
    -1024
    >>> int.from_bytes(b'\xfc\x00', byteorder='big', signed=False)
    64512
    >>> int.from_bytes([255, 0, 0], byteorder='big')
    16711680
    
The argument bytes must either be a bytes-like object or an iterable producing
bytes.

The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the
integer. If byteorder is `"big"`, the most significant byte is at the
beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is `"little"`, the most significant
byte is at the end of the byte array. To request the native byte order of the
host system, use `sys.byteorder` as the byte order value.

The signed argument indicates whether two’s complement is used to represent
the integer.

New in version 3.2.

`int.as_integer_ratio()`

    
Return a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the original integer
and with a positive denominator. The integer ratio of integers (whole numbers)
is always the integer as the numerator and `1` as the denominator.

New in version 3.8.

### Additional Methods on Float

The float type implements the `numbers.Real` abstract base class. float also
has the following additional methods.

`float.as_integer_ratio()`

    
Return a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the original float
and with a positive denominator. Raises `OverflowError` on infinities and a
`ValueError` on NaNs.

`float.is_integer()`

    
Return `True` if the float instance is finite with integral value, and `False`
otherwise:

    
    >>> (-2.0).is_integer()
    True
    >>> (3.2).is_integer()
    False
    
Two methods support conversion to and from hexadecimal strings. Since Python’s
floats are stored internally as binary numbers, converting a float to or from
a decimal string usually involves a small rounding error. In contrast,
hexadecimal strings allow exact representation and specification of floating-
point numbers. This can be useful when debugging, and in numerical work.

`float.hex()`

    
Return a representation of a floating-point number as a hexadecimal string.
For finite floating-point numbers, this representation will always include a
leading `0x` and a trailing `p` and exponent.

`classmethod float.fromhex(s)`

    
Class method to return the float represented by a hexadecimal string s. The
string s may have leading and trailing whitespace.

Note that `float.hex()` is an instance method, while `float.fromhex()` is a
class method.

A hexadecimal string takes the form:

    
    [sign] ['0x'] integer ['.' fraction] ['p' exponent]
    
where the optional `sign` may by either `+` or `-`, `integer` and `fraction`
are strings of hexadecimal digits, and `exponent` is a decimal integer with an
optional leading sign. Case is not significant, and there must be at least one
hexadecimal digit in either the integer or the fraction. This syntax is
similar to the syntax specified in section 6.4.4.2 of the C99 standard, and
also to the syntax used in Java 1.5 onwards. In particular, the output of
`float.hex()` is usable as a hexadecimal floating-point literal in C or Java
code, and hexadecimal strings produced by C’s `%a` format character or Java’s
`Double.toHexString` are accepted by `float.fromhex()`.

Note that the exponent is written in decimal rather than hexadecimal, and that
it gives the power of 2 by which to multiply the coefficient. For example, the
hexadecimal string `0x3.a7p10` represents the floating-point number `(3 +
10./16 + 7./16**2) * 2.0**10`, or `3740.0`:

    
    >>> float.fromhex('0x3.a7p10')
    3740.0
    
Applying the reverse conversion to `3740.0` gives a different hexadecimal
string representing the same number:

    
    >>> float.hex(3740.0)
    '0x1.d380000000000p+11'
    
### Hashing of numeric types

For numbers `x` and `y`, possibly of different types, it’s a requirement that
`hash(x) == hash(y)` whenever `x == y` (see the `__hash__()` method
documentation for more details). For ease of implementation and efficiency
across a variety of numeric types (including `int`, `float`, `decimal.Decimal`
and `fractions.Fraction`) Python’s hash for numeric types is based on a single
mathematical function that’s defined for any rational number, and hence
applies to all instances of `int` and `fractions.Fraction`, and all finite
instances of `float` and `decimal.Decimal`. Essentially, this function is
given by reduction modulo `P` for a fixed prime `P`. The value of `P` is made
available to Python as the `modulus` attribute of `sys.hash_info`.

CPython implementation detail: Currently, the prime used is `P = 2**31 - 1` on
machines with 32-bit C longs and `P = 2**61 - 1` on machines with 64-bit C
longs.

Here are the rules in detail:

  * If `x = m / n` is a nonnegative rational number and `n` is not divisible by `P`, define `hash(x)` as `m * invmod(n, P) % P`, where `invmod(n, P)` gives the inverse of `n` modulo `P`.
  * If `x = m / n` is a nonnegative rational number and `n` is divisible by `P` (but `m` is not) then `n` has no inverse modulo `P` and the rule above doesn’t apply; in this case define `hash(x)` to be the constant value `sys.hash_info.inf`.
  * If `x = m / n` is a negative rational number define `hash(x)` as `-hash(-x)`. If the resulting hash is `-1`, replace it with `-2`.
  * The particular values `sys.hash_info.inf`, `-sys.hash_info.inf` and `sys.hash_info.nan` are used as hash values for positive infinity, negative infinity, or nans (respectively). (All hashable nans have the same hash value.)
  * For a `complex` number `z`, the hash values of the real and imaginary parts are combined by computing `hash(z.real) + sys.hash_info.imag * hash(z.imag)`, reduced modulo `2**sys.hash_info.width` so that it lies in `range(-2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1), 2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1))`. Again, if the result is `-1`, it’s replaced with `-2`.

To clarify the above rules, here’s some example Python code, equivalent to the
built-in hash, for computing the hash of a rational number, `float`, or
`complex`:

    
    import sys, math
    
    def hash_fraction(m, n):
        """Compute the hash of a rational number m / n.
    
        Assumes m and n are integers, with n positive.
        Equivalent to hash(fractions.Fraction(m, n)).
    
        """
        P = sys.hash_info.modulus
        # Remove common factors of P.  (Unnecessary if m and n already coprime.)
        while m % P == n % P == 0:
            m, n = m // P, n // P
    
        if n % P == 0:
            hash_value = sys.hash_info.inf
        else:
            # Fermat's Little Theorem: pow(n, P-1, P) is 1, so
            # pow(n, P-2, P) gives the inverse of n modulo P.
            hash_value = (abs(m) % P) * pow(n, P - 2, P) % P
        if m < 0:
            hash_value = -hash_value
        if hash_value == -1:
            hash_value = -2
        return hash_value
    
    def hash_float(x):
        """Compute the hash of a float x."""
    
        if math.isnan(x):
            return sys.hash_info.nan
        elif math.isinf(x):
            return sys.hash_info.inf if x > 0 else -sys.hash_info.inf
        else:
            return hash_fraction(*x.as_integer_ratio())
    
    def hash_complex(z):
        """Compute the hash of a complex number z."""
    
        hash_value = hash_float(z.real) + sys.hash_info.imag * hash_float(z.imag)
        # do a signed reduction modulo 2**sys.hash_info.width
        M = 2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1)
        hash_value = (hash_value & (M - 1)) - (hash_value & M)
        if hash_value == -1:
            hash_value = -2
        return hash_value
    
## Iterator Types

Python supports a concept of iteration over containers. This is implemented
using two distinct methods; these are used to allow user-defined classes to
support iteration. Sequences, described below in more detail, always support
the iteration methods.

One method needs to be defined for container objects to provide iteration
support:

`container.__iter__()`

    
Return an iterator object. The object is required to support the iterator
protocol described below. If a container supports different types of
iteration, additional methods can be provided to specifically request
iterators for those iteration types. (An example of an object supporting
multiple forms of iteration would be a tree structure which supports both
breadth-first and depth-first traversal.) This method corresponds to the
`tp_iter` slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.

The iterator objects themselves are required to support the following two
methods, which together form the iterator protocol:

`iterator.__iter__()`

    
Return the iterator object itself. This is required to allow both containers
and iterators to be used with the `for` and `in` statements. This method
corresponds to the `tp_iter` slot of the type structure for Python objects in
the Python/C API.

`iterator.__next__()`

    
Return the next item from the container. If there are no further items, raise
the `StopIteration` exception. This method corresponds to the `tp_iternext`
slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API.

Python defines several iterator objects to support iteration over general and
specific sequence types, dictionaries, and other more specialized forms. The
specific types are not important beyond their implementation of the iterator
protocol.

Once an iterator’s `__next__()` method raises `StopIteration`, it must
continue to do so on subsequent calls. Implementations that do not obey this
property are deemed broken.

### Generator Types

Python’s generators provide a convenient way to implement the iterator
protocol. If a container object’s `__iter__()` method is implemented as a
generator, it will automatically return an iterator object (technically, a
generator object) supplying the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. More
information about generators can be found in the documentation for the yield
expression.

## Sequence Types — list, tuple, range

There are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range objects.
Additional sequence types tailored for processing of binary data and text
strings are described in dedicated sections.

### Common Sequence Operations

The operations in the following table are supported by most sequence types,
both mutable and immutable. The `collections.abc.Sequence` ABC is provided to
make it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence
types.

This table lists the sequence operations sorted in ascending priority. In the
table, s and t are sequences of the same type, n, i, j and k are integers and
x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions imposed by
s.

The `in` and `not in` operations have the same priorities as the comparison
operations. The `+` (concatenation) and `*` (repetition) operations have the
same priority as the corresponding numeric operations. 3

Operation | Result | Notes  
---|---|---  
`x in s` | `True` if an item of s is equal to x, else `False` | (1)  
`x not in s` | `False` if an item of s is equal to x, else `True` | (1)  
`s + t` | the concatenation of s and t | (6)(7)  
`s * n` or `n * s` | equivalent to adding s to itself n times | (2)(7)  
`s[i]` | ith item of s, origin 0 | (3)  
`s[i:j]` | slice of s from i to j | (3)(4)  
`s[i:j:k]` | slice of s from i to j with step k | (3)(5)  
`len(s)` | length of s |   
`min(s)` | smallest item of s |   
`max(s)` | largest item of s |   
`s.index(x[, i[, j]])` | index of the first occurrence of x in s (at or after index i and before index j) | (8)  
`s.count(x)` | total number of occurrences of x in s |   
Sequences of the same type also support comparisons. In particular, tuples and
lists are compared lexicographically by comparing corresponding elements. This
means that to compare equal, every element must compare equal and the two
sequences must be of the same type and have the same length. (For full details
see Comparisons in the language reference.)

Notes:

  1. While the `in` and `not in` operations are used only for simple containment testing in the general case, some specialised sequences (such as `str`, `bytes` and `bytearray`) also use them for subsequence testing:
        >>> "gg" in "eggs"
    True
    
  2. Values of n less than `0` are treated as `0` (which yields an empty sequence of the same type as s). Note that items in the sequence s are not copied; they are referenced multiple times. This often haunts new Python programmers; consider:
        >>> lists = [[]] * 3
    >>> lists
    [[], [], []]
    >>> lists[0].append(3)
    >>> lists
    [[3], [3], [3]]
    
What has happened is that `[[]]` is a one-element list containing an empty
list, so all three elements of `[[]] * 3` are references to this single empty
list. Modifying any of the elements of `lists` modifies this single list. You
can create a list of different lists this way:

        >>> lists = [[] for i in range(3)]
    >>> lists[0].append(3)
    >>> lists[1].append(5)
    >>> lists[2].append(7)
    >>> lists
    [[3], [5], [7]]
    
Further explanation is available in the FAQ entry How do I create a
multidimensional list?.

  3. If i or j is negative, the index is relative to the end of sequence s: `len(s) + i` or `len(s) + j` is substituted. But note that `-0` is still `0`.
  4. The slice of s from i to j is defined as the sequence of items with index k such that `i <= k < j`. If i or j is greater than `len(s)`, use `len(s)`. If i is omitted or `None`, use `0`. If j is omitted or `None`, use `len(s)`. If i is greater than or equal to j, the slice is empty.
  5. The slice of s from i to j with step k is defined as the sequence of items with index `x = i + n*k` such that `0 <= n < (j-i)/k`. In other words, the indices are `i`, `i+k`, `i+2*k`, `i+3*k` and so on, stopping when j is reached (but never including j). When k is positive, i and j are reduced to `len(s)` if they are greater. When k is negative, i and j are reduced to `len(s) - 1` if they are greater. If i or j are omitted or `None`, they become “end” values (which end depends on the sign of k). Note, k cannot be zero. If k is `None`, it is treated like `1`.
  6. Concatenating immutable sequences always results in a new object. This means that building up a sequence by repeated concatenation will have a quadratic runtime cost in the total sequence length. To get a linear runtime cost, you must switch to one of the alternatives below:
     * if concatenating `str` objects, you can build a list and use `str.join()` at the end or else write to an `io.StringIO` instance and retrieve its value when complete
     * if concatenating `bytes` objects, you can similarly use `bytes.join()` or `io.BytesIO`, or you can do in-place concatenation with a `bytearray` object. `bytearray` objects are mutable and have an efficient overallocation mechanism
     * if concatenating `tuple` objects, extend a `list` instead
     * for other types, investigate the relevant class documentation
  7. Some sequence types (such as `range`) only support item sequences that follow specific patterns, and hence don’t support sequence concatenation or repetition.
  8. `index` raises `ValueError` when x is not found in s. Not all implementations support passing the additional arguments i and j. These arguments allow efficient searching of subsections of the sequence. Passing the extra arguments is roughly equivalent to using `s[i:j].index(x)`, only without copying any data and with the returned index being relative to the start of the sequence rather than the start of the slice.

### Immutable Sequence Types

The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is
not also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the `hash()`
built-in.

This support allows immutable sequences, such as `tuple` instances, to be used
as `dict` keys and stored in `set` and `frozenset` instances.

Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will
result in `TypeError`.

### Mutable Sequence Types

The operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence types.
The `collections.abc.MutableSequence` ABC is provided to make it easier to
correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types.

In the table s is an instance of a mutable sequence type, t is any iterable
object and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions
imposed by s (for example, `bytearray` only accepts integers that meet the
value restriction `0 <= x <= 255`).

Operation | Result | Notes  
---|---|---  
`s[i] = x` | item i of s is replaced by x |   
`s[i:j] = t` | slice of s from i to j is replaced by the contents of the iterable t |   
`del s[i:j]` | same as `s[i:j] = []` |   
`s[i:j:k] = t` | the elements of `s[i:j:k]` are replaced by those of t | (1)  
`del s[i:j:k]` | removes the elements of `s[i:j:k]` from the list |   
`s.append(x)` | appends x to the end of the sequence (same as `s[len(s):len(s)] = [x]`) |   
`s.clear()` | removes all items from s (same as `del s[:]`) | (5)  
`s.copy()` | creates a shallow copy of s (same as `s[:]`) | (5)  
`s.extend(t)` or `s += t` | extends s with the contents of t (for the most part the same as `s[len(s):len(s)] = t`) |   
`s *= n` | updates s with its contents repeated n times | (6)  
`s.insert(i, x)` | inserts x into s at the index given by i (same as `s[i:i] = [x]`) |   
`s.pop([i])` | retrieves the item at i and also removes it from s | (2)  
`s.remove(x)` | remove the first item from s where `s[i]` is equal to x | (3)  
`s.reverse()` | reverses the items of s in place | (4)  
Notes:

  1. t must have the same length as the slice it is replacing.
  2. The optional argument i defaults to `-1`, so that by default the last item is removed and returned.
  3. `remove()` raises `ValueError` when x is not found in s.
  4. The `reverse()` method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when reversing a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the reversed sequence.
  5. `clear()` and `copy()` are included for consistency with the interfaces of mutable containers that don’t support slicing operations (such as `dict` and `set`). `copy()` is not part of the `collections.abc.MutableSequence` ABC, but most concrete mutable sequence classes provide it.
New in version 3.3: `clear()` and `copy()` methods.

  6. The value n is an integer, or an object implementing `__index__()`. Zero and negative values of n clear the sequence. Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced multiple times, as explained for `s * n` under Common Sequence Operations.

### Lists

Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of
homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by
application).

`class list([iterable])`

    
Lists may be constructed in several ways:

  * Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list: `[]`
  * Using square brackets, separating items with commas: `[a]`, `[a, b, c]`
  * Using a list comprehension: `[x for x in iterable]`
  * Using the type constructor: `list()` or `list(iterable)`

The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same order
as iterable’s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that
supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a list, a
copy is made and returned, similar to `iterable[:]`. For example,
`list('abc')` returns `['a', 'b', 'c']` and `list( (1, 2, 3) )` returns `[1,
2, 3]`. If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list,
`[]`.

Many other operations also produce lists, including the `sorted()` built-in.

Lists implement all of the common and mutable sequence operations. Lists also
provide the following additional method:

`sort(*, key=None, reverse=False)`

    
This method sorts the list in place, using only `<` comparisons between items.
Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations fail, the entire
sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be left in a partially
modified state).

`sort()` accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword (keyword-
only arguments):

key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison
key from each list element (for example, `key=str.lower`). The key
corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for
the entire sorting process. The default value of `None` means that list items
are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value.

The `functools.cmp_to_key()` utility is available to convert a 2.x style cmp
function to a key function.

reverse is a boolean value. If set to `True`, then the list elements are
sorted as if each comparison were reversed.

This method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when sorting a
large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not
return the sorted sequence (use `sorted()` to explicitly request a new sorted
list instance).

The `sort()` method is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it
guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal —
this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by
department, then by salary grade).

For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see Sorting HOW TO.

CPython implementation detail: While a list is being sorted, the effect of
attempting to mutate, or even inspect, the list is undefined. The C
implementation of Python makes the list appear empty for the duration, and
raises `ValueError` if it can detect that the list has been mutated during a
sort.

### Tuples

Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of
heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the `enumerate()` built-
in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous
data is needed (such as allowing storage in a `set` or `dict` instance).

`class tuple([iterable])`

    
Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways:

  * Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple: `()`
  * Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: `a,` or `(a,)`
  * Separating items with commas: `a, b, c` or `(a, b, c)`
  * Using the `tuple()` built-in: `tuple()` or `tuple(iterable)`

The constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the same order
as iterable’s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that
supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a tuple, it
is returned unchanged. For example, `tuple('abc')` returns `('a', 'b', 'c')`
and `tuple( [1, 2, 3] )` returns `(1, 2, 3)`. If no argument is given, the
constructor creates a new empty tuple, `()`.

Note that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses.
The parentheses are optional, except in the empty tuple case, or when they are
needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. For example, `f(a, b, c)` is a function
call with three arguments, while `f((a, b, c))` is a function call with a
3-tuple as the sole argument.

Tuples implement all of the common sequence operations.

For heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer than
access by index, `collections.namedtuple()` may be a more appropriate choice
than a simple tuple object.

### Ranges

The `range` type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly
used for looping a specific number of times in `for` loops.

`class range(stop)`

`class range(start, stop[, step])`

    
The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in `int`
or any object that implements the `__index__` special method). If the step
argument is omitted, it defaults to `1`. If the start argument is omitted, it
defaults to `0`. If step is zero, `ValueError` is raised.

For a positive step, the contents of a range `r` are determined by the formula
`r[i] = start + step*i` where `i >= 0` and `r[i] < stop`.

For a negative step, the contents of the range are still determined by the
formula `r[i] = start + step*i`, but the constraints are `i >= 0` and `r[i] >
stop`.

A range object will be empty if `r[0]` does not meet the value constraint.
Ranges do support negative indices, but these are interpreted as indexing from
the end of the sequence determined by the positive indices.

Ranges containing absolute values larger than `sys.maxsize` are permitted but
some features (such as `len()`) may raise `OverflowError`.

Range examples:

    
    >>> list(range(10))
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    >>> list(range(1, 11))
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    >>> list(range(0, 30, 5))
    [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
    >>> list(range(0, 10, 3))
    [0, 3, 6, 9]
    >>> list(range(0, -10, -1))
    [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]
    >>> list(range(0))
    []
    >>> list(range(1, 0))
    []
    
Ranges implement all of the common sequence operations except concatenation
and repetition (due to the fact that range objects can only represent
sequences that follow a strict pattern and repetition and concatenation will
usually violate that pattern).

`start`

    
The value of the start parameter (or `0` if the parameter was not supplied)

`stop`

    
The value of the stop parameter

`step`

    
The value of the step parameter (or `1` if the parameter was not supplied)

The advantage of the `range` type over a regular `list` or `tuple` is that a
`range` object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter
the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the `start`, `stop` and
`step` values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed).

Range objects implement the `collections.abc.Sequence` ABC, and provide
features such as containment tests, element index lookup, slicing and support
for negative indices (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range):

    
    >>> r = range(0, 20, 2)
    >>> r
    range(0, 20, 2)
    >>> 11 in r
    False
    >>> 10 in r
    True
    >>> r.index(10)
    5
    >>> r[5]
    10
    >>> r[:5]
    range(0, 10, 2)
    >>> r[-1]
    18
    
Testing range objects for equality with `==` and `!=` compares them as
sequences. That is, two range objects are considered equal if they represent
the same sequence of values. (Note that two range objects that compare equal
might have different `start`, `stop` and `step` attributes, for example
`range(0) == range(2, 1, 3)` or `range(0, 3, 2) == range(0, 4, 2)`.)

Changed in version 3.2: Implement the Sequence ABC. Support slicing and
negative indices. Test `int` objects for membership in constant time instead
of iterating through all items.

Changed in version 3.3: Define ‘==’ and ‘!=’ to compare range objects based on
the sequence of values they define (instead of comparing based on object
identity).

New in version 3.3: The `start`, `stop` and `step` attributes.

See also

  * The linspace recipe shows how to implement a lazy version of range suitable for floating point applications.

## Text Sequence Type — str

Textual data in Python is handled with `str` objects, or strings. Strings are
immutable sequences of Unicode code points. String literals are written in a
variety of ways:

  * Single quotes: `'allows embedded "double" quotes'`
  * Double quotes: `"allows embedded 'single' quotes"`.
  * Triple quoted: `'''Three single quotes'''`, `"""Three double quotes"""`

Triple quoted strings may span multiple lines - all associated whitespace will
be included in the string literal.

String literals that are part of a single expression and have only whitespace
between them will be implicitly converted to a single string literal. That is,
`("spam " "eggs") == "spam eggs"`.

See String and Bytes literals for more about the various forms of string
literal, including supported escape sequences, and the `r` (“raw”) prefix that
disables most escape sequence processing.

Strings may also be created from other objects using the `str` constructor.

Since there is no separate “character” type, indexing a string produces
strings of length 1. That is, for a non-empty string s, `s[0] == s[0:1]`.

There is also no mutable string type, but `str.join()` or `io.StringIO` can be
used to efficiently construct strings from multiple fragments.

Changed in version 3.3: For backwards compatibility with the Python 2 series,
the `u` prefix is once again permitted on string literals. It has no effect on
the meaning of string literals and cannot be combined with the `r` prefix.

`class str(object='')`

`class str(object=b'', encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')`

    
Return a string version of object. If object is not provided, returns the
empty string. Otherwise, the behavior of `str()` depends on whether encoding
or errors is given, as follows.

If neither encoding nor errors is given, `str(object)` returns
`object.__str__()`, which is the “informal” or nicely printable string
representation of object. For string objects, this is the string itself. If
object does not have a `__str__()` method, then `str()` falls back to
returning `repr(object)`.

If at least one of encoding or errors is given, object should be a bytes-like
object (e.g. `bytes` or `bytearray`). In this case, if object is a `bytes` (or
`bytearray`) object, then `str(bytes, encoding, errors)` is equivalent to
`bytes.decode(encoding, errors)`. Otherwise, the bytes object underlying the
buffer object is obtained before calling `bytes.decode()`. See Binary Sequence
Types — bytes, bytearray, memoryview and Buffer Protocol for information on
buffer objects.

Passing a `bytes` object to `str()` without the encoding or errors arguments
falls under the first case of returning the informal string representation
(see also the `-b` command-line option to Python). For example:

    
    >>> str(b'Zoot!')
    "b'Zoot!'"
    
For more information on the `str` class and its methods, see Text Sequence
Type — str and the String Methods section below. To output formatted strings,
see the Formatted string literals and Format String Syntax sections. In
addition, see the Text Processing Services section.

### String Methods

Strings implement all of the common sequence operations, along with the
additional methods described below.

Strings also support two styles of string formatting, one providing a large
degree of flexibility and customization (see `str.format()`, Format String
Syntax and Custom String Formatting) and the other based on C `printf` style
formatting that handles a narrower range of types and is slightly harder to
use correctly, but is often faster for the cases it can handle (printf-style
String Formatting).

The Text Processing Services section of the standard library covers a number
of other modules that provide various text related utilities (including
regular expression support in the `re` module).

`str.capitalize()`

    
Return a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the rest
lowercased.

Changed in version 3.8: The first character is now put into titlecase rather
than uppercase. This means that characters like digraphs will only have their
first letter capitalized, instead of the full character.

`str.casefold()`

    
Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used for
caseless matching.

Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is
intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example, the German
lowercase letter `'ß'` is equivalent to `"ss"`. Since it is already lowercase,
`lower()` would do nothing to `'ß'`; `casefold()` converts it to `"ss"`.

The casefolding algorithm is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode
Standard.

New in version 3.3.

`str.center(width[, fillchar])`

    
Return centered in a string of length width. Padding is done using the
specified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The original string is
returned if width is less than or equal to `len(s)`.

`str.count(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the range
[start, end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice
notation.

`str.encode(encoding="utf-8", errors="strict")`

    
Return an encoded version of the string as a bytes object. Default encoding is
`'utf-8'`. errors may be given to set a different error handling scheme. The
default for errors is `'strict'`, meaning that encoding errors raise a
`UnicodeError`. Other possible values are `'ignore'`, `'replace'`,
`'xmlcharrefreplace'`, `'backslashreplace'` and any other name registered via
`codecs.register_error()`, see section Error Handlers. For a list of possible
encodings, see section Standard Encodings.

By default, the errors argument is not checked for best performances, but only
used at the first encoding error. Enable the Python Development Mode, or use a
debug build to check errors.

Changed in version 3.1: Support for keyword arguments added.

Changed in version 3.9: The errors is now checked in development mode and in
debug mode.

`str.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])`

    
Return `True` if the string ends with the specified suffix, otherwise return
`False`. suffix can also be a tuple of suffixes to look for. With optional
start, test beginning at that position. With optional end, stop comparing at
that position.

`str.expandtabs(tabsize=8)`

    
Return a copy of the string where all tab characters are replaced by one or
more spaces, depending on the current column and the given tab size. Tab
positions occur every tabsize characters (default is 8, giving tab positions
at columns 0, 8, 16 and so on). To expand the string, the current column is
set to zero and the string is examined character by character. If the
character is a tab (`\t`), one or more space characters are inserted in the
result until the current column is equal to the next tab position. (The tab
character itself is not copied.) If the character is a newline (`\n`) or
return (`\r`), it is copied and the current column is reset to zero. Any other
character is copied unchanged and the current column is incremented by one
regardless of how the character is represented when printed.

    
    >>> '01\t012\t0123\t01234'.expandtabs()
    '01      012     0123    01234'
    >>> '01\t012\t0123\t01234'.expandtabs(4)
    '01  012 0123    01234'
    
`str.find(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within the
slice `s[start:end]`. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in
slice notation. Return `-1` if sub is not found.

Note

The `find()` method should be used only if you need to know the position of
sub. To check if sub is a substring or not, use the `in` operator:

    
    >>> 'Py' in 'Python'
    True
    
`str.format(*args, **kwargs)`

    
Perform a string formatting operation. The string on which this method is
called can contain literal text or replacement fields delimited by braces
`{}`. Each replacement field contains either the numeric index of a positional
argument, or the name of a keyword argument. Returns a copy of the string
where each replacement field is replaced with the string value of the
corresponding argument.

    
    >>> "The sum of 1 + 2 is {0}".format(1+2)
    'The sum of 1 + 2 is 3'
    
See Format String Syntax for a description of the various formatting options
that can be specified in format strings.

Note

When formatting a number (`int`, `float`, `complex`, `decimal.Decimal` and
subclasses) with the `n` type (ex: `'{:n}'.format(1234)`), the function
temporarily sets the `LC_CTYPE` locale to the `LC_NUMERIC` locale to decode
`decimal_point` and `thousands_sep` fields of `localeconv()` if they are non-
ASCII or longer than 1 byte, and the `LC_NUMERIC` locale is different than the
`LC_CTYPE` locale. This temporary change affects other threads.

Changed in version 3.7: When formatting a number with the `n` type, the
function sets temporarily the `LC_CTYPE` locale to the `LC_NUMERIC` locale in
some cases.

`str.format_map(mapping)`

    
Similar to `str.format(**mapping)`, except that `mapping` is used directly and
not copied to a `dict`. This is useful if for example `mapping` is a dict
subclass:

    
    >>> class Default(dict):
    ...     def __missing__(self, key):
    ...         return key
    ...
    >>> '{name} was born in {country}'.format_map(Default(name='Guido'))
    'Guido was born in country'
    
New in version 3.2.

`str.index(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Like `find()`, but raise `ValueError` when the substring is not found.

`str.isalnum()`

    
Return `True` if all characters in the string are alphanumeric and there is at
least one character, `False` otherwise. A character `c` is alphanumeric if one
of the following returns `True`: `c.isalpha()`, `c.isdecimal()`,
`c.isdigit()`, or `c.isnumeric()`.

`str.isalpha()`

    
Return `True` if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at
least one character, `False` otherwise. Alphabetic characters are those
characters defined in the Unicode character database as “Letter”, i.e., those
with general category property being one of “Lm”, “Lt”, “Lu”, “Ll”, or “Lo”.
Note that this is different from the “Alphabetic” property defined in the
Unicode Standard.

`str.isascii()`

    
Return `True` if the string is empty or all characters in the string are
ASCII, `False` otherwise. ASCII characters have code points in the range
U+0000-U+007F.

New in version 3.7.

`str.isdecimal()`

    
Return `True` if all characters in the string are decimal characters and there
is at least one character, `False` otherwise. Decimal characters are those
that can be used to form numbers in base 10, e.g. U+0660, ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT
ZERO. Formally a decimal character is a character in the Unicode General
Category “Nd”.

`str.isdigit()`

    
Return `True` if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least
one character, `False` otherwise. Digits include decimal characters and digits
that need special handling, such as the compatibility superscript digits. This
covers digits which cannot be used to form numbers in base 10, like the
Kharosthi numbers. Formally, a digit is a character that has the property
value Numeric_Type=Digit or Numeric_Type=Decimal.

`str.isidentifier()`

    
Return `True` if the string is a valid identifier according to the language
definition, section Identifiers and keywords.

Call `keyword.iskeyword()` to test whether string `s` is a reserved
identifier, such as `def` and `class`.

Example:

    
    >>> from keyword import iskeyword
    
    >>> 'hello'.isidentifier(), iskeyword('hello')
    True, False
    >>> 'def'.isidentifier(), iskeyword('def')
    True, True
    
`str.islower()`

    
Return `True` if all cased characters 4 in the string are lowercase and there
is at least one cased character, `False` otherwise.

`str.isnumeric()`

    
Return `True` if all characters in the string are numeric characters, and
there is at least one character, `False` otherwise. Numeric characters include
digit characters, and all characters that have the Unicode numeric value
property, e.g. U+2155, VULGAR FRACTION ONE FIFTH. Formally, numeric characters
are those with the property value Numeric_Type=Digit, Numeric_Type=Decimal or
Numeric_Type=Numeric.

`str.isprintable()`

    
Return `True` if all characters in the string are printable or the string is
empty, `False` otherwise. Nonprintable characters are those characters defined
in the Unicode character database as “Other” or “Separator”, excepting the
ASCII space (0x20) which is considered printable. (Note that printable
characters in this context are those which should not be escaped when `repr()`
is invoked on a string. It has no bearing on the handling of strings written
to `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`.)

`str.isspace()`

    
Return `True` if there are only whitespace characters in the string and there
is at least one character, `False` otherwise.

A character is whitespace if in the Unicode character database (see
`unicodedata`), either its general category is `Zs` (“Separator, space”), or
its bidirectional class is one of `WS`, `B`, or `S`.

`str.istitle()`

    
Return `True` if the string is a titlecased string and there is at least one
character, for example uppercase characters may only follow uncased characters
and lowercase characters only cased ones. Return `False` otherwise.

`str.isupper()`

    
Return `True` if all cased characters 4 in the string are uppercase and there
is at least one cased character, `False` otherwise.

    
    >>> 'BANANA'.isupper()
    True
    >>> 'banana'.isupper()
    False
    >>> 'baNana'.isupper()
    False
    >>> ' '.isupper()
    False
    
`str.join(iterable)`

    
Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable. A
`TypeError` will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable,
including `bytes` objects. The separator between elements is the string
providing this method.

`str.ljust(width[, fillchar])`

    
Return the string left justified in a string of length width. Padding is done
using the specified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The original string
is returned if width is less than or equal to `len(s)`.

`str.lower()`

    
Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters 4 converted to
lowercase.

The lowercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode
Standard.

`str.lstrip([chars])`

    
Return a copy of the string with leading characters removed. The chars
argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed. If
omitted or `None`, the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace. The
chars argument is not a prefix; rather, all combinations of its values are
stripped:

    
    >>> '   spacious   '.lstrip()
    'spacious   '
    >>> 'www.example.com'.lstrip('cmowz.')
    'example.com'
    
See `str.removeprefix()` for a method that will remove a single prefix string
rather than all of a set of characters. For example:

    
    >>> 'Arthur: three!'.lstrip('Arthur: ')
    'ee!'
    >>> 'Arthur: three!'.removeprefix('Arthur: ')
    'three!'
    
`static str.maketrans(x[, y[, z]])`

    
This static method returns a translation table usable for `str.translate()`.

If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode
ordinals (integers) or characters (strings of length 1) to Unicode ordinals,
strings (of arbitrary lengths) or `None`. Character keys will then be
converted to ordinals.

If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and in the
resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the character at
the same position in y. If there is a third argument, it must be a string,
whose characters will be mapped to `None` in the result.

`str.partition(sep)`

    
Split the string at the first occurrence of sep, and return a 3-tuple
containing the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part
after the separator. If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple
containing the string itself, followed by two empty strings.

`str.removeprefix(prefix, /)`

    
If the string starts with the prefix string, return `string[len(prefix):]`.
Otherwise, return a copy of the original string:

    
    >>> 'TestHook'.removeprefix('Test')
    'Hook'
    >>> 'BaseTestCase'.removeprefix('Test')
    'BaseTestCase'
    
New in version 3.9.

`str.removesuffix(suffix, /)`

    
If the string ends with the suffix string and that suffix is not empty, return
`string[:-len(suffix)]`. Otherwise, return a copy of the original string:

    
    >>> 'MiscTests'.removesuffix('Tests')
    'Misc'
    >>> 'TmpDirMixin'.removesuffix('Tests')
    'TmpDirMixin'
    
New in version 3.9.

`str.replace(old, new[, count])`

    
Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by
new. If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences
are replaced.

`str.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Return the highest index in the string where substring sub is found, such that
sub is contained within `s[start:end]`. Optional arguments start and end are
interpreted as in slice notation. Return `-1` on failure.

`str.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Like `rfind()` but raises `ValueError` when the substring sub is not found.

`str.rjust(width[, fillchar])`

    
Return the string right justified in a string of length width. Padding is done
using the specified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The original string
is returned if width is less than or equal to `len(s)`.

`str.rpartition(sep)`

    
Split the string at the last occurrence of sep, and return a 3-tuple
containing the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part
after the separator. If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple
containing two empty strings, followed by the string itself.

`str.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)`

    
Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string.
If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done, the rightmost ones. If
sep is not specified or `None`, any whitespace string is a separator. Except
for splitting from the right, `rsplit()` behaves like `split()` which is
described in detail below.

`str.rstrip([chars])`

    
Return a copy of the string with trailing characters removed. The chars
argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed. If
omitted or `None`, the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace. The
chars argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are
stripped:

    
    >>> '   spacious   '.rstrip()
    '   spacious'
    >>> 'mississippi'.rstrip('ipz')
    'mississ'
    
See `str.removesuffix()` for a method that will remove a single suffix string
rather than all of a set of characters. For example:

    
    >>> 'Monty Python'.rstrip(' Python')
    'M'
    >>> 'Monty Python'.removesuffix(' Python')
    'Monty'
    
`str.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)`

    
Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string.
If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done (thus, the list will
have at most `maxsplit+1` elements). If maxsplit is not specified or `-1`,
then there is no limit on the number of splits (all possible splits are made).

If sep is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are
deemed to delimit empty strings (for example, `'1,,2'.split(',')` returns
`['1', '', '2']`). The sep argument may consist of multiple characters (for
example, `'1<>2<>3'.split('<>')` returns `['1', '2', '3']`). Splitting an
empty string with a specified separator returns `['']`.

For example:

    
    >>> '1,2,3'.split(',')
    ['1', '2', '3']
    >>> '1,2,3'.split(',', maxsplit=1)
    ['1', '2,3']
    >>> '1,2,,3,'.split(',')
    ['1', '2', '', '3', '']
    
If sep is not specified or is `None`, a different splitting algorithm is
applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator,
and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string
has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an empty string or
a string consisting of just whitespace with a `None` separator returns `[]`.

For example:

    
    >>> '1 2 3'.split()
    ['1', '2', '3']
    >>> '1 2 3'.split(maxsplit=1)
    ['1', '2 3']
    >>> '   1   2   3   '.split()
    ['1', '2', '3']
    
`str.splitlines([keepends])`

    
Return a list of the lines in the string, breaking at line boundaries. Line
breaks are not included in the resulting list unless keepends is given and
true.

This method splits on the following line boundaries. In particular, the
boundaries are a superset of universal newlines.

Representation | Description  
---|---  
`\n` | Line Feed  
`\r` | Carriage Return  
`\r\n` | Carriage Return + Line Feed  
`\v` or `\x0b` | Line Tabulation  
`\f` or `\x0c` | Form Feed  
`\x1c` | File Separator  
`\x1d` | Group Separator  
`\x1e` | Record Separator  
`\x85` | Next Line (C1 Control Code)  
`\u2028` | Line Separator  
`\u2029` | Paragraph Separator  
Changed in version 3.2: `\v` and `\f` added to list of line boundaries.

For example:

    
    >>> 'ab c\n\nde fg\rkl\r\n'.splitlines()
    ['ab c', '', 'de fg', 'kl']
    >>> 'ab c\n\nde fg\rkl\r\n'.splitlines(keepends=True)
    ['ab c\n', '\n', 'de fg\r', 'kl\r\n']
    
Unlike `split()` when a delimiter string sep is given, this method returns an
empty list for the empty string, and a terminal line break does not result in
an extra line:

    
    >>> "".splitlines()
    []
    >>> "One line\n".splitlines()
    ['One line']
    
For comparison, `split('\n')` gives:

    
    >>> ''.split('\n')
    ['']
    >>> 'Two lines\n'.split('\n')
    ['Two lines', '']
    
`str.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]])`

    
Return `True` if string starts with the prefix, otherwise return `False`.
prefix can also be a tuple of prefixes to look for. With optional start, test
string beginning at that position. With optional end, stop comparing string at
that position.

`str.strip([chars])`

    
Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed.
The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.
If omitted or `None`, the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace. The
chars argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its
values are stripped:

    
    >>> '   spacious   '.strip()
    'spacious'
    >>> 'www.example.com'.strip('cmowz.')
    'example'
    
The outermost leading and trailing chars argument values are stripped from the
string. Characters are removed from the leading end until reaching a string
character that is not contained in the set of characters in chars. A similar
action takes place on the trailing end. For example:

    
    >>> comment_string = '#....... Section 3.2.1 Issue #32 .......'
    >>> comment_string.strip('.#! ')
    'Section 3.2.1 Issue #32'
    
`str.swapcase()`

    
Return a copy of the string with uppercase characters converted to lowercase
and vice versa. Note that it is not necessarily true that
`s.swapcase().swapcase() == s`.

`str.title()`

    
Return a titlecased version of the string where words start with an uppercase
character and the remaining characters are lowercase.

For example:

    
    >>> 'Hello world'.title()
    'Hello World'
    
The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as
groups of consecutive letters. The definition works in many contexts but it
means that apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word boundaries,
which may not be the desired result:

    
    >>> "they're bill's friends from the UK".title()
    "They'Re Bill'S Friends From The Uk"
    
A workaround for apostrophes can be constructed using regular expressions:

    
    >>> import re
    >>> def titlecase(s):
    ...     return re.sub(r"[A-Za-z]+('[A-Za-z]+)?",
    ...                   lambda mo: mo.group(0).capitalize(),
    ...                   s)
    ...
    >>> titlecase("they're bill's friends.")
    "They're Bill's Friends."
    
`str.translate(table)`

    
Return a copy of the string in which each character has been mapped through
the given translation table. The table must be an object that implements
indexing via `__getitem__()`, typically a mapping or sequence. When indexed by
a Unicode ordinal (an integer), the table object can do any of the following:
return a Unicode ordinal or a string, to map the character to one or more
other characters; return `None`, to delete the character from the return
string; or raise a `LookupError` exception, to map the character to itself.

You can use `str.maketrans()` to create a translation map from character-to-
character mappings in different formats.

See also the `codecs` module for a more flexible approach to custom character
mappings.

`str.upper()`

    
Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters 4 converted to
uppercase. Note that `s.upper().isupper()` might be `False` if `s` contains
uncased characters or if the Unicode category of the resulting character(s) is
not “Lu” (Letter, uppercase), but e.g. “Lt” (Letter, titlecase).

The uppercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 of the Unicode
Standard.

`str.zfill(width)`

    
Return a copy of the string left filled with ASCII `'0'` digits to make a
string of length width. A leading sign prefix (`'+'`/`'-'`) is handled by
inserting the padding after the sign character rather than before. The
original string is returned if width is less than or equal to `len(s)`.

For example:

    
    >>> "42".zfill(5)
    '00042'
    >>> "-42".zfill(5)
    '-0042'
    
###  `printf`-style String Formatting

Note

The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead
to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and
dictionaries correctly). Using the newer formatted string literals, the
`str.format()` interface, or template strings may help avoid these errors.
Each of these alternatives provides their own trade-offs and benefits of
simplicity, flexibility, and/or extensibility.

String objects have one unique built-in operation: the `%` operator (modulo).
This is also known as the string formatting or interpolation operator. Given
`format % values` (where format is a string), `%` conversion specifications in
format are replaced with zero or more elements of values. The effect is
similar to using the `sprintf()` in the C language.

If format requires a single argument, values may be a single non-tuple object.
5 Otherwise, values must be a tuple with exactly the number of items specified
by the format string, or a single mapping object (for example, a dictionary).

A conversion specifier contains two or more characters and has the following
components, which must occur in this order:

  1. The `'%'` character, which marks the start of the specifier.
  2. Mapping key (optional), consisting of a parenthesised sequence of characters (for example, `(somename)`).
  3. Conversion flags (optional), which affect the result of some conversion types.
  4. Minimum field width (optional). If specified as an `'*'` (asterisk), the actual width is read from the next element of the tuple in values, and the object to convert comes after the minimum field width and optional precision.
  5. Precision (optional), given as a `'.'` (dot) followed by the precision. If specified as `'*'` (an asterisk), the actual precision is read from the next element of the tuple in values, and the value to convert comes after the precision.
  6. Length modifier (optional).
  7. Conversion type.

When the right argument is a dictionary (or other mapping type), then the
formats in the string must include a parenthesised mapping key into that
dictionary inserted immediately after the `'%'` character. The mapping key
selects the value to be formatted from the mapping. For example:

    
    >>> print('%(language)s has %(number)03d quote types.' %
    ...       {'language': "Python", "number": 2})
    Python has 002 quote types.
    
In this case no `*` specifiers may occur in a format (since they require a
sequential parameter list).

The conversion flag characters are:

Flag | Meaning  
---|---  
`'#'` | The value conversion will use the “alternate form” (where defined below).  
`'0'` | The conversion will be zero padded for numeric values.  
`'-'` | The converted value is left adjusted (overrides the `'0'` conversion if both are given).  
`' '` | (a space) A blank should be left before a positive number (or empty string) produced by a signed conversion.  
`'+'` | A sign character (`'+'` or `'-'`) will precede the conversion (overrides a “space” flag).  
A length modifier (`h`, `l`, or `L`) may be present, but is ignored as it is
not necessary for Python – so e.g. `%ld` is identical to `%d`.

The conversion types are:

Conversion | Meaning | Notes  
---|---|---  
`'d'` | Signed integer decimal. |   
`'i'` | Signed integer decimal. |   
`'o'` | Signed octal value. | (1)  
`'u'` | Obsolete type – it is identical to `'d'`. | (6)  
`'x'` | Signed hexadecimal (lowercase). | (2)  
`'X'` | Signed hexadecimal (uppercase). | (2)  
`'e'` | Floating point exponential format (lowercase). | (3)  
`'E'` | Floating point exponential format (uppercase). | (3)  
`'f'` | Floating point decimal format. | (3)  
`'F'` | Floating point decimal format. | (3)  
`'g'` | Floating point format. Uses lowercase exponential format if exponent is less than -4 or not less than precision, decimal format otherwise. | (4)  
`'G'` | Floating point format. Uses uppercase exponential format if exponent is less than -4 or not less than precision, decimal format otherwise. | (4)  
`'c'` | Single character (accepts integer or single character string). |   
`'r'` | String (converts any Python object using `repr()`). | (5)  
`'s'` | String (converts any Python object using `str()`). | (5)  
`'a'` | String (converts any Python object using `ascii()`). | (5)  
`'%'` | No argument is converted, results in a `'%'` character in the result. |   
Notes:

  1. The alternate form causes a leading octal specifier (`'0o'`) to be inserted before the first digit.
  2. The alternate form causes a leading `'0x'` or `'0X'` (depending on whether the `'x'` or `'X'` format was used) to be inserted before the first digit.
  3. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, even if no digits follow it.
The precision determines the number of digits after the decimal point and
defaults to 6.

  4. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, and trailing zeroes are not removed as they would otherwise be.
The precision determines the number of significant digits before and after the
decimal point and defaults to 6.

  5. If precision is `N`, the output is truncated to `N` characters.
  6. See PEP 237.

Since Python strings have an explicit length, `%s` conversions do not assume
that `'\0'` is the end of the string.

Changed in version 3.1: `%f` conversions for numbers whose absolute value is
over 1e50 are no longer replaced by `%g` conversions.

## Binary Sequence Types — bytes, bytearray, memoryview

The core built-in types for manipulating binary data are `bytes` and
`bytearray`. They are supported by `memoryview` which uses the buffer protocol
to access the memory of other binary objects without needing to make a copy.

The `array` module supports efficient storage of basic data types like 32-bit
integers and IEEE754 double-precision floating values.

### Bytes Objects

Bytes objects are immutable sequences of single bytes. Since many major binary
protocols are based on the ASCII text encoding, bytes objects offer several
methods that are only valid when working with ASCII compatible data and are
closely related to string objects in a variety of other ways.

`class bytes([source[, encoding[, errors]]])`

    
Firstly, the syntax for bytes literals is largely the same as that for string
literals, except that a `b` prefix is added:

  * Single quotes: `b'still allows embedded "double" quotes'`
  * Double quotes: `b"still allows embedded 'single' quotes"`.
  * Triple quoted: `b'''3 single quotes'''`, `b"""3 double quotes"""`

Only ASCII characters are permitted in bytes literals (regardless of the
declared source code encoding). Any binary values over 127 must be entered
into bytes literals using the appropriate escape sequence.

As with string literals, bytes literals may also use a `r` prefix to disable
processing of escape sequences. See String and Bytes literals for more about
the various forms of bytes literal, including supported escape sequences.

While bytes literals and representations are based on ASCII text, bytes
objects actually behave like immutable sequences of integers, with each value
in the sequence restricted such that `0 <= x < 256` (attempts to violate this
restriction will trigger `ValueError`). This is done deliberately to emphasise
that while many binary formats include ASCII based elements and can be
usefully manipulated with some text-oriented algorithms, this is not generally
the case for arbitrary binary data (blindly applying text processing
algorithms to binary data formats that are not ASCII compatible will usually
lead to data corruption).

In addition to the literal forms, bytes objects can be created in a number of
other ways:

  * A zero-filled bytes object of a specified length: `bytes(10)`
  * From an iterable of integers: `bytes(range(20))`
  * Copying existing binary data via the buffer protocol: `bytes(obj)`

Also see the bytes built-in.

Since 2 hexadecimal digits correspond precisely to a single byte, hexadecimal
numbers are a commonly used format for describing binary data. Accordingly,
the bytes type has an additional class method to read data in that format:

`classmethod fromhex(string)`

    
This `bytes` class method returns a bytes object, decoding the given string
object. The string must contain two hexadecimal digits per byte, with ASCII
whitespace being ignored.

    
    >>> bytes.fromhex('2Ef0 F1f2  ')
    b'.\xf0\xf1\xf2'
    
Changed in version 3.7: `bytes.fromhex()` now skips all ASCII whitespace in
the string, not just spaces.

A reverse conversion function exists to transform a bytes object into its
hexadecimal representation.

`hex([sep[, bytes_per_sep]])`

    
Return a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte in the
instance.

    
    >>> b'\xf0\xf1\xf2'.hex()
    'f0f1f2'
    
If you want to make the hex string easier to read, you can specify a single
character separator sep parameter to include in the output. By default between
each byte. A second optional bytes_per_sep parameter controls the spacing.
Positive values calculate the separator position from the right, negative
values from the left.

    
    >>> value = b'\xf0\xf1\xf2'
    >>> value.hex('-')
    'f0-f1-f2'
    >>> value.hex('_', 2)
    'f0_f1f2'
    >>> b'UUDDLRLRAB'.hex(' ', -4)
    '55554444 4c524c52 4142'
    
New in version 3.5.

Changed in version 3.8: `bytes.hex()` now supports optional sep and
bytes_per_sep parameters to insert separators between bytes in the hex output.

Since bytes objects are sequences of integers (akin to a tuple), for a bytes
object b, `b[0]` will be an integer, while `b[0:1]` will be a bytes object of
length 1. (This contrasts with text strings, where both indexing and slicing
will produce a string of length 1)

The representation of bytes objects uses the literal format (`b'...'`) since
it is often more useful than e.g. `bytes([46, 46, 46])`. You can always
convert a bytes object into a list of integers using `list(b)`.

Note

For Python 2.x users: In the Python 2.x series, a variety of implicit
conversions between 8-bit strings (the closest thing 2.x offers to a built-in
binary data type) and Unicode strings were permitted. This was a backwards
compatibility workaround to account for the fact that Python originally only
supported 8-bit text, and Unicode text was a later addition. In Python 3.x,
those implicit conversions are gone - conversions between 8-bit binary data
and Unicode text must be explicit, and bytes and string objects will always
compare unequal.

### Bytearray Objects

`bytearray` objects are a mutable counterpart to `bytes` objects.

`class bytearray([source[, encoding[, errors]]])`

    
There is no dedicated literal syntax for bytearray objects, instead they are
always created by calling the constructor:

  * Creating an empty instance: `bytearray()`
  * Creating a zero-filled instance with a given length: `bytearray(10)`
  * From an iterable of integers: `bytearray(range(20))`
  * Copying existing binary data via the buffer protocol: `bytearray(b'Hi!')`

As bytearray objects are mutable, they support the mutable sequence operations
in addition to the common bytes and bytearray operations described in Bytes
and Bytearray Operations.

Also see the bytearray built-in.

Since 2 hexadecimal digits correspond precisely to a single byte, hexadecimal
numbers are a commonly used format for describing binary data. Accordingly,
the bytearray type has an additional class method to read data in that format:

`classmethod fromhex(string)`

    
This `bytearray` class method returns bytearray object, decoding the given
string object. The string must contain two hexadecimal digits per byte, with
ASCII whitespace being ignored.

    
    >>> bytearray.fromhex('2Ef0 F1f2  ')
    bytearray(b'.\xf0\xf1\xf2')
    
Changed in version 3.7: `bytearray.fromhex()` now skips all ASCII whitespace
in the string, not just spaces.

A reverse conversion function exists to transform a bytearray object into its
hexadecimal representation.

`hex([sep[, bytes_per_sep]])`

    
Return a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte in the
instance.

    
    >>> bytearray(b'\xf0\xf1\xf2').hex()
    'f0f1f2'
    
New in version 3.5.

Changed in version 3.8: Similar to `bytes.hex()`, `bytearray.hex()` now
supports optional sep and bytes_per_sep parameters to insert separators
between bytes in the hex output.

Since bytearray objects are sequences of integers (akin to a list), for a
bytearray object b, `b[0]` will be an integer, while `b[0:1]` will be a
bytearray object of length 1. (This contrasts with text strings, where both
indexing and slicing will produce a string of length 1)

The representation of bytearray objects uses the bytes literal format
(`bytearray(b'...')`) since it is often more useful than e.g. `bytearray([46,
46, 46])`. You can always convert a bytearray object into a list of integers
using `list(b)`.

### Bytes and Bytearray Operations

Both bytes and bytearray objects support the common sequence operations. They
interoperate not just with operands of the same type, but with any bytes-like
object. Due to this flexibility, they can be freely mixed in operations
without causing errors. However, the return type of the result may depend on
the order of operands.

Note

The methods on bytes and bytearray objects don’t accept strings as their
arguments, just as the methods on strings don’t accept bytes as their
arguments. For example, you have to write:

    
    a = "abc"
    b = a.replace("a", "f")
    
and:

    
    a = b"abc"
    b = a.replace(b"a", b"f")
    
Some bytes and bytearray operations assume the use of ASCII compatible binary
formats, and hence should be avoided when working with arbitrary binary data.
These restrictions are covered below.

Note

Using these ASCII based operations to manipulate binary data that is not
stored in an ASCII based format may lead to data corruption.

The following methods on bytes and bytearray objects can be used with
arbitrary binary data.

`bytes.count(sub[, start[, end]])`

`bytearray.count(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of subsequence sub in the
range [start, end]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in
slice notation.

The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in
the range 0 to 255.

Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the
subsequence.

`bytes.removeprefix(prefix, /)`

`bytearray.removeprefix(prefix, /)`

    
If the binary data starts with the prefix string, return
`bytes[len(prefix):]`. Otherwise, return a copy of the original binary data:

    
    >>> b'TestHook'.removeprefix(b'Test')
    b'Hook'
    >>> b'BaseTestCase'.removeprefix(b'Test')
    b'BaseTestCase'
    
The prefix may be any bytes-like object.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

New in version 3.9.

`bytes.removesuffix(suffix, /)`

`bytearray.removesuffix(suffix, /)`

    
If the binary data ends with the suffix string and that suffix is not empty,
return `bytes[:-len(suffix)]`. Otherwise, return a copy of the original binary
data:

    
    >>> b'MiscTests'.removesuffix(b'Tests')
    b'Misc'
    >>> b'TmpDirMixin'.removesuffix(b'Tests')
    b'TmpDirMixin'
    
The suffix may be any bytes-like object.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

New in version 3.9.

`bytes.decode(encoding="utf-8", errors="strict")`

`bytearray.decode(encoding="utf-8", errors="strict")`

    
Return a string decoded from the given bytes. Default encoding is `'utf-8'`.
errors may be given to set a different error handling scheme. The default for
errors is `'strict'`, meaning that encoding errors raise a `UnicodeError`.
Other possible values are `'ignore'`, `'replace'` and any other name
registered via `codecs.register_error()`, see section Error Handlers. For a
list of possible encodings, see section Standard Encodings.

By default, the errors argument is not checked for best performances, but only
used at the first decoding error. Enable the Python Development Mode, or use a
debug build to check errors.

Note

Passing the encoding argument to `str` allows decoding any bytes-like object
directly, without needing to make a temporary bytes or bytearray object.

Changed in version 3.1: Added support for keyword arguments.

Changed in version 3.9: The errors is now checked in development mode and in
debug mode.

`bytes.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])`

`bytearray.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])`

    
Return `True` if the binary data ends with the specified suffix, otherwise
return `False`. suffix can also be a tuple of suffixes to look for. With
optional start, test beginning at that position. With optional end, stop
comparing at that position.

The suffix(es) to search for may be any bytes-like object.

`bytes.find(sub[, start[, end]])`

`bytearray.find(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Return the lowest index in the data where the subsequence sub is found, such
that sub is contained in the slice `s[start:end]`. Optional arguments start
and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return `-1` if sub is not found.

The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in
the range 0 to 255.

Note

The `find()` method should be used only if you need to know the position of
sub. To check if sub is a substring or not, use the `in` operator:

    
    >>> b'Py' in b'Python'
    True
    
Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the
subsequence.

`bytes.index(sub[, start[, end]])`

`bytearray.index(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Like `find()`, but raise `ValueError` when the subsequence is not found.

The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in
the range 0 to 255.

Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the
subsequence.

`bytes.join(iterable)`

`bytearray.join(iterable)`

    
Return a bytes or bytearray object which is the concatenation of the binary
data sequences in iterable. A `TypeError` will be raised if there are any
values in iterable that are not bytes-like objects, including `str` objects.
The separator between elements is the contents of the bytes or bytearray
object providing this method.

`static bytes.maketrans(from, to)`

`static bytearray.maketrans(from, to)`

    
This static method returns a translation table usable for `bytes.translate()`
that will map each character in from into the character at the same position
in to; from and to must both be bytes-like objects and have the same length.

New in version 3.1.

`bytes.partition(sep)`

`bytearray.partition(sep)`

    
Split the sequence at the first occurrence of sep, and return a 3-tuple
containing the part before the separator, the separator itself or its
bytearray copy, and the part after the separator. If the separator is not
found, return a 3-tuple containing a copy of the original sequence, followed
by two empty bytes or bytearray objects.

The separator to search for may be any bytes-like object.

`bytes.replace(old, new[, count])`

`bytearray.replace(old, new[, count])`

    
Return a copy of the sequence with all occurrences of subsequence old replaced
by new. If the optional argument count is given, only the first count
occurrences are replaced.

The subsequence to search for and its replacement may be any bytes-like
object.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])`

`bytearray.rfind(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Return the highest index in the sequence where the subsequence sub is found,
such that sub is contained within `s[start:end]`. Optional arguments start and
end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return `-1` on failure.

The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in
the range 0 to 255.

Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the
subsequence.

`bytes.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])`

`bytearray.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])`

    
Like `rfind()` but raises `ValueError` when the subsequence sub is not found.

The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in
the range 0 to 255.

Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the
subsequence.

`bytes.rpartition(sep)`

`bytearray.rpartition(sep)`

    
Split the sequence at the last occurrence of sep, and return a 3-tuple
containing the part before the separator, the separator itself or its
bytearray copy, and the part after the separator. If the separator is not
found, return a 3-tuple containing two empty bytes or bytearray objects,
followed by a copy of the original sequence.

The separator to search for may be any bytes-like object.

`bytes.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]])`

`bytearray.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]])`

    
Return `True` if the binary data starts with the specified prefix, otherwise
return `False`. prefix can also be a tuple of prefixes to look for. With
optional start, test beginning at that position. With optional end, stop
comparing at that position.

The prefix(es) to search for may be any bytes-like object.

`bytes.translate(table, /, delete=b'')`

`bytearray.translate(table, /, delete=b'')`

    
Return a copy of the bytes or bytearray object where all bytes occurring in
the optional argument delete are removed, and the remaining bytes have been
mapped through the given translation table, which must be a bytes object of
length 256.

You can use the `bytes.maketrans()` method to create a translation table.

Set the table argument to `None` for translations that only delete characters:

    
    >>> b'read this short text'.translate(None, b'aeiou')
    b'rd ths shrt txt'
    
Changed in version 3.6: delete is now supported as a keyword argument.

The following methods on bytes and bytearray objects have default behaviours
that assume the use of ASCII compatible binary formats, but can still be used
with arbitrary binary data by passing appropriate arguments. Note that all of
the bytearray methods in this section do not operate in place, and instead
produce new objects.

`bytes.center(width[, fillbyte])`

`bytearray.center(width[, fillbyte])`

    
Return a copy of the object centered in a sequence of length width. Padding is
done using the specified fillbyte (default is an ASCII space). For `bytes`
objects, the original sequence is returned if width is less than or equal to
`len(s)`.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.ljust(width[, fillbyte])`

`bytearray.ljust(width[, fillbyte])`

    
Return a copy of the object left justified in a sequence of length width.
Padding is done using the specified fillbyte (default is an ASCII space). For
`bytes` objects, the original sequence is returned if width is less than or
equal to `len(s)`.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.lstrip([chars])`

`bytearray.lstrip([chars])`

    
Return a copy of the sequence with specified leading bytes removed. The chars
argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of byte values to be removed
- the name refers to the fact this method is usually used with ASCII
characters. If omitted or `None`, the chars argument defaults to removing
ASCII whitespace. The chars argument is not a prefix; rather, all combinations
of its values are stripped:

    
    >>> b'   spacious   '.lstrip()
    b'spacious   '
    >>> b'www.example.com'.lstrip(b'cmowz.')
    b'example.com'
    
The binary sequence of byte values to remove may be any bytes-like object. See
`removeprefix()` for a method that will remove a single prefix string rather
than all of a set of characters. For example:

    
    >>> b'Arthur: three!'.lstrip(b'Arthur: ')
    b'ee!'
    >>> b'Arthur: three!'.removeprefix(b'Arthur: ')
    b'three!'
    
Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.rjust(width[, fillbyte])`

`bytearray.rjust(width[, fillbyte])`

    
Return a copy of the object right justified in a sequence of length width.
Padding is done using the specified fillbyte (default is an ASCII space). For
`bytes` objects, the original sequence is returned if width is less than or
equal to `len(s)`.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)`

`bytearray.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)`

    
Split the binary sequence into subsequences of the same type, using sep as the
delimiter string. If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done, the
rightmost ones. If sep is not specified or `None`, any subsequence consisting
solely of ASCII whitespace is a separator. Except for splitting from the
right, `rsplit()` behaves like `split()` which is described in detail below.

`bytes.rstrip([chars])`

`bytearray.rstrip([chars])`

    
Return a copy of the sequence with specified trailing bytes removed. The chars
argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of byte values to be removed
- the name refers to the fact this method is usually used with ASCII
characters. If omitted or `None`, the chars argument defaults to removing
ASCII whitespace. The chars argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations
of its values are stripped:

    
    >>> b'   spacious   '.rstrip()
    b'   spacious'
    >>> b'mississippi'.rstrip(b'ipz')
    b'mississ'
    
The binary sequence of byte values to remove may be any bytes-like object. See
`removesuffix()` for a method that will remove a single suffix string rather
than all of a set of characters. For example:

    
    >>> b'Monty Python'.rstrip(b' Python')
    b'M'
    >>> b'Monty Python'.removesuffix(b' Python')
    b'Monty'
    
Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)`

`bytearray.split(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)`

    
Split the binary sequence into subsequences of the same type, using sep as the
delimiter string. If maxsplit is given and non-negative, at most maxsplit
splits are done (thus, the list will have at most `maxsplit+1` elements). If
maxsplit is not specified or is `-1`, then there is no limit on the number of
splits (all possible splits are made).

If sep is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are
deemed to delimit empty subsequences (for example, `b'1,,2'.split(b',')`
returns `[b'1', b'', b'2']`). The sep argument may consist of a multibyte
sequence (for example, `b'1<>2<>3'.split(b'<>')` returns `[b'1', b'2',
b'3']`). Splitting an empty sequence with a specified separator returns
`[b'']` or `[bytearray(b'')]` depending on the type of object being split. The
sep argument may be any bytes-like object.

For example:

    
    >>> b'1,2,3'.split(b',')
    [b'1', b'2', b'3']
    >>> b'1,2,3'.split(b',', maxsplit=1)
    [b'1', b'2,3']
    >>> b'1,2,,3,'.split(b',')
    [b'1', b'2', b'', b'3', b'']
    
If sep is not specified or is `None`, a different splitting algorithm is
applied: runs of consecutive ASCII whitespace are regarded as a single
separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if
the sequence has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an
empty sequence or a sequence consisting solely of ASCII whitespace without a
specified separator returns `[]`.

For example:

    
    >>> b'1 2 3'.split()
    [b'1', b'2', b'3']
    >>> b'1 2 3'.split(maxsplit=1)
    [b'1', b'2 3']
    >>> b'   1   2   3   '.split()
    [b'1', b'2', b'3']
    
`bytes.strip([chars])`

`bytearray.strip([chars])`

    
Return a copy of the sequence with specified leading and trailing bytes
removed. The chars argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of byte
values to be removed - the name refers to the fact this method is usually used
with ASCII characters. If omitted or `None`, the chars argument defaults to
removing ASCII whitespace. The chars argument is not a prefix or suffix;
rather, all combinations of its values are stripped:

    
    >>> b'   spacious   '.strip()
    b'spacious'
    >>> b'www.example.com'.strip(b'cmowz.')
    b'example'
    
The binary sequence of byte values to remove may be any bytes-like object.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

The following methods on bytes and bytearray objects assume the use of ASCII
compatible binary formats and should not be applied to arbitrary binary data.
Note that all of the bytearray methods in this section do not operate in
place, and instead produce new objects.

`bytes.capitalize()`

`bytearray.capitalize()`

    
Return a copy of the sequence with each byte interpreted as an ASCII
character, and the first byte capitalized and the rest lowercased. Non-ASCII
byte values are passed through unchanged.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.expandtabs(tabsize=8)`

`bytearray.expandtabs(tabsize=8)`

    
Return a copy of the sequence where all ASCII tab characters are replaced by
one or more ASCII spaces, depending on the current column and the given tab
size. Tab positions occur every tabsize bytes (default is 8, giving tab
positions at columns 0, 8, 16 and so on). To expand the sequence, the current
column is set to zero and the sequence is examined byte by byte. If the byte
is an ASCII tab character (`b'\t'`), one or more space characters are inserted
in the result until the current column is equal to the next tab position. (The
tab character itself is not copied.) If the current byte is an ASCII newline
(`b'\n'`) or carriage return (`b'\r'`), it is copied and the current column is
reset to zero. Any other byte value is copied unchanged and the current column
is incremented by one regardless of how the byte value is represented when
printed:

    
    >>> b'01\t012\t0123\t01234'.expandtabs()
    b'01      012     0123    01234'
    >>> b'01\t012\t0123\t01234'.expandtabs(4)
    b'01  012 0123    01234'
    
Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.isalnum()`

`bytearray.isalnum()`

    
Return `True` if all bytes in the sequence are alphabetical ASCII characters
or ASCII decimal digits and the sequence is not empty, `False` otherwise.
Alphabetic ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
`b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`. ASCII decimal
digits are those byte values in the sequence `b'0123456789'`.

For example:

    
    >>> b'ABCabc1'.isalnum()
    True
    >>> b'ABC abc1'.isalnum()
    False
    
`bytes.isalpha()`

`bytearray.isalpha()`

    
Return `True` if all bytes in the sequence are alphabetic ASCII characters and
the sequence is not empty, `False` otherwise. Alphabetic ASCII characters are
those byte values in the sequence
`b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.

For example:

    
    >>> b'ABCabc'.isalpha()
    True
    >>> b'ABCabc1'.isalpha()
    False
    
`bytes.isascii()`

`bytearray.isascii()`

    
Return `True` if the sequence is empty or all bytes in the sequence are ASCII,
`False` otherwise. ASCII bytes are in the range 0-0x7F.

New in version 3.7.

`bytes.isdigit()`

`bytearray.isdigit()`

    
Return `True` if all bytes in the sequence are ASCII decimal digits and the
sequence is not empty, `False` otherwise. ASCII decimal digits are those byte
values in the sequence `b'0123456789'`.

For example:

    
    >>> b'1234'.isdigit()
    True
    >>> b'1.23'.isdigit()
    False
    
`bytes.islower()`

`bytearray.islower()`

    
Return `True` if there is at least one lowercase ASCII character in the
sequence and no uppercase ASCII characters, `False` otherwise.

For example:

    
    >>> b'hello world'.islower()
    True
    >>> b'Hello world'.islower()
    False
    
Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
`b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte
values in the sequence `b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.

`bytes.isspace()`

`bytearray.isspace()`

    
Return `True` if all bytes in the sequence are ASCII whitespace and the
sequence is not empty, `False` otherwise. ASCII whitespace characters are
those byte values in the sequence `b' \t\n\r\x0b\f'` (space, tab, newline,
carriage return, vertical tab, form feed).

`bytes.istitle()`

`bytearray.istitle()`

    
Return `True` if the sequence is ASCII titlecase and the sequence is not
empty, `False` otherwise. See `bytes.title()` for more details on the
definition of “titlecase”.

For example:

    
    >>> b'Hello World'.istitle()
    True
    >>> b'Hello world'.istitle()
    False
    
`bytes.isupper()`

`bytearray.isupper()`

    
Return `True` if there is at least one uppercase alphabetic ASCII character in
the sequence and no lowercase ASCII characters, `False` otherwise.

For example:

    
    >>> b'HELLO WORLD'.isupper()
    True
    >>> b'Hello world'.isupper()
    False
    
Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
`b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte
values in the sequence `b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.

`bytes.lower()`

`bytearray.lower()`

    
Return a copy of the sequence with all the uppercase ASCII characters
converted to their corresponding lowercase counterpart.

For example:

    
    >>> b'Hello World'.lower()
    b'hello world'
    
Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
`b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte
values in the sequence `b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.splitlines(keepends=False)`

`bytearray.splitlines(keepends=False)`

    
Return a list of the lines in the binary sequence, breaking at ASCII line
boundaries. This method uses the universal newlines approach to splitting
lines. Line breaks are not included in the resulting list unless keepends is
given and true.

For example:

    
    >>> b'ab c\n\nde fg\rkl\r\n'.splitlines()
    [b'ab c', b'', b'de fg', b'kl']
    >>> b'ab c\n\nde fg\rkl\r\n'.splitlines(keepends=True)
    [b'ab c\n', b'\n', b'de fg\r', b'kl\r\n']
    
Unlike `split()` when a delimiter string sep is given, this method returns an
empty list for the empty string, and a terminal line break does not result in
an extra line:

    
    >>> b"".split(b'\n'), b"Two lines\n".split(b'\n')
    ([b''], [b'Two lines', b''])
    >>> b"".splitlines(), b"One line\n".splitlines()
    ([], [b'One line'])
    
`bytes.swapcase()`

`bytearray.swapcase()`

    
Return a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII characters
converted to their corresponding uppercase counterpart and vice-versa.

For example:

    
    >>> b'Hello World'.swapcase()
    b'hELLO wORLD'
    
Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
`b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte
values in the sequence `b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.

Unlike `str.swapcase()`, it is always the case that `bin.swapcase().swapcase()
== bin` for the binary versions. Case conversions are symmetrical in ASCII,
even though that is not generally true for arbitrary Unicode code points.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.title()`

`bytearray.title()`

    
Return a titlecased version of the binary sequence where words start with an
uppercase ASCII character and the remaining characters are lowercase. Uncased
byte values are left unmodified.

For example:

    
    >>> b'Hello world'.title()
    b'Hello World'
    
Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
`b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte
values in the sequence `b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`. All other byte values
are uncased.

The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as
groups of consecutive letters. The definition works in many contexts but it
means that apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word boundaries,
which may not be the desired result:

    
    >>> b"they're bill's friends from the UK".title()
    b"They'Re Bill'S Friends From The Uk"
    
A workaround for apostrophes can be constructed using regular expressions:

    
    >>> import re
    >>> def titlecase(s):
    ...     return re.sub(rb"[A-Za-z]+('[A-Za-z]+)?",
    ...                   lambda mo: mo.group(0)[0:1].upper() +
    ...                              mo.group(0)[1:].lower(),
    ...                   s)
    ...
    >>> titlecase(b"they're bill's friends.")
    b"They're Bill's Friends."
    
Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.upper()`

`bytearray.upper()`

    
Return a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII characters
converted to their corresponding uppercase counterpart.

For example:

    
    >>> b'Hello World'.upper()
    b'HELLO WORLD'
    
Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence
`b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte
values in the sequence `b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'`.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

`bytes.zfill(width)`

`bytearray.zfill(width)`

    
Return a copy of the sequence left filled with ASCII `b'0'` digits to make a
sequence of length width. A leading sign prefix (`b'+'`/ `b'-'`) is handled by
inserting the padding after the sign character rather than before. For `bytes`
objects, the original sequence is returned if width is less than or equal to
`len(seq)`.

For example:

    
    >>> b"42".zfill(5)
    b'00042'
    >>> b"-42".zfill(5)
    b'-0042'
    
Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

###  `printf`-style Bytes Formatting

Note

The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead
to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and
dictionaries correctly). If the value being printed may be a tuple or
dictionary, wrap it in a tuple.

Bytes objects (`bytes`/`bytearray`) have one unique built-in operation: the
`%` operator (modulo). This is also known as the bytes formatting or
interpolation operator. Given `format % values` (where format is a bytes
object), `%` conversion specifications in format are replaced with zero or
more elements of values. The effect is similar to using the `sprintf()` in the
C language.

If format requires a single argument, values may be a single non-tuple object.
5 Otherwise, values must be a tuple with exactly the number of items specified
by the format bytes object, or a single mapping object (for example, a
dictionary).

A conversion specifier contains two or more characters and has the following
components, which must occur in this order:

  1. The `'%'` character, which marks the start of the specifier.
  2. Mapping key (optional), consisting of a parenthesised sequence of characters (for example, `(somename)`).
  3. Conversion flags (optional), which affect the result of some conversion types.
  4. Minimum field width (optional). If specified as an `'*'` (asterisk), the actual width is read from the next element of the tuple in values, and the object to convert comes after the minimum field width and optional precision.
  5. Precision (optional), given as a `'.'` (dot) followed by the precision. If specified as `'*'` (an asterisk), the actual precision is read from the next element of the tuple in values, and the value to convert comes after the precision.
  6. Length modifier (optional).
  7. Conversion type.

When the right argument is a dictionary (or other mapping type), then the
formats in the bytes object must include a parenthesised mapping key into that
dictionary inserted immediately after the `'%'` character. The mapping key
selects the value to be formatted from the mapping. For example:

    
    >>> print(b'%(language)s has %(number)03d quote types.' %
    ...       {b'language': b"Python", b"number": 2})
    b'Python has 002 quote types.'
    
In this case no `*` specifiers may occur in a format (since they require a
sequential parameter list).

The conversion flag characters are:

Flag | Meaning  
---|---  
`'#'` | The value conversion will use the “alternate form” (where defined below).  
`'0'` | The conversion will be zero padded for numeric values.  
`'-'` | The converted value is left adjusted (overrides the `'0'` conversion if both are given).  
`' '` | (a space) A blank should be left before a positive number (or empty string) produced by a signed conversion.  
`'+'` | A sign character (`'+'` or `'-'`) will precede the conversion (overrides a “space” flag).  
A length modifier (`h`, `l`, or `L`) may be present, but is ignored as it is
not necessary for Python – so e.g. `%ld` is identical to `%d`.

The conversion types are:

Conversion | Meaning | Notes

Notes:

  1. The alternate form causes a leading octal specifier (`'0o'`) to be inserted before the first digit.
  2. The alternate form causes a leading `'0x'` or `'0X'` (depending on whether the `'x'` or `'X'` format was used) to be inserted before the first digit.
  3. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, even if no digits follow it.
The precision determines the number of digits after the decimal point and
defaults to 6.

  4. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, and trailing zeroes are not removed as they would otherwise be.
The precision determines the number of significant digits before and after the
decimal point and defaults to 6.

  5. If precision is `N`, the output is truncated to `N` characters.
  6. `b'%s'` is deprecated, but will not be removed during the 3.x series.
  7. `b'%r'` is deprecated, but will not be removed during the 3.x series.
  8. See PEP 237.

Note

The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always
produces a new object, even if no changes were made.

### Memory Views

`memoryview` objects allow Python code to access the internal data of an
object that supports the buffer protocol without copying.

`class memoryview(obj)`

    
Create a `memoryview` that references obj. obj must support the buffer
protocol. Built-in objects that support the buffer protocol include `bytes`
and `bytearray`.

A `memoryview` has the notion of an element, which is the atomic memory unit
handled by the originating object obj. For many simple types such as `bytes`
and `bytearray`, an element is a single byte, but other types such as
`array.array` may have bigger elements.

`len(view)` is equal to the length of `tolist`. If `view.ndim = 0`, the length
is 1. If `view.ndim = 1`, the length is equal to the number of elements in the
view. For higher dimensions, the length is equal to the length of the nested
list representation of the view. The `itemsize` attribute will give you the
number of bytes in a single element.

A `memoryview` supports slicing and indexing to expose its data. One-
dimensional slicing will result in a subview:

    
    >>> v = memoryview(b'abcefg')
    >>> v[1]
    98
    >>> v[-1]
    103
    >>> v[1:4]
    <memory at 0x7f3ddc9f4350>
    >>> bytes(v[1:4])
    b'bce'
    
If `format` is one of the native format specifiers from the `struct` module,
indexing with an integer or a tuple of integers is also supported and returns
a single element with the correct type. One-dimensional memoryviews can be
indexed with an integer or a one-integer tuple. Multi-dimensional memoryviews
can be indexed with tuples of exactly ndim integers where ndim is the number
of dimensions. Zero-dimensional memoryviews can be indexed with the empty
tuple.

Here is an example with a non-byte format:

    
    >>> import array
    >>> a = array.array('l', [-11111111, 22222222, -33333333, 44444444])
    >>> m = memoryview(a)
    >>> m[0]
    -11111111
    >>> m[-1]
    44444444
    >>> m[::2].tolist()
    [-11111111, -33333333]
    
If the underlying object is writable, the memoryview supports one-dimensional
slice assignment. Resizing is not allowed:

    
    >>> data = bytearray(b'abcefg')
    >>> v = memoryview(data)
    >>> v.readonly
    False
    >>> v[0] = ord(b'z')
    >>> data
    bytearray(b'zbcefg')
    >>> v[1:4] = b'123'
    >>> data
    bytearray(b'z123fg')
    >>> v[2:3] = b'spam'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ValueError: memoryview assignment: lvalue and rvalue have different structures
    >>> v[2:6] = b'spam'
    >>> data
    bytearray(b'z1spam')
    
One-dimensional memoryviews of hashable (read-only) types with formats ‘B’,
‘b’ or ‘c’ are also hashable. The hash is defined as `hash(m) ==
hash(m.tobytes())`:

    
    >>> v = memoryview(b'abcefg')
    >>> hash(v) == hash(b'abcefg')
    True
    >>> hash(v[2:4]) == hash(b'ce')
    True
    >>> hash(v[::-2]) == hash(b'abcefg'[::-2])
    True
    
Changed in version 3.3: One-dimensional memoryviews can now be sliced. One-
dimensional memoryviews with formats ‘B’, ‘b’ or ‘c’ are now hashable.

Changed in version 3.4: memoryview is now registered automatically with
`collections.abc.Sequence`

Changed in version 3.5: memoryviews can now be indexed with tuple of integers.

`memoryview` has several methods:

`__eq__(exporter)`

    
A memoryview and a PEP 3118 exporter are equal if their shapes are equivalent
and if all corresponding values are equal when the operands’ respective format
codes are interpreted using `struct` syntax.

For the subset of `struct` format strings currently supported by `tolist()`,
`v` and `w` are equal if `v.tolist() == w.tolist()`:

    
    >>> import array
    >>> a = array.array('I', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    >>> b = array.array('d', [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    >>> c = array.array('b', [5, 3, 1])
    >>> x = memoryview(a)
    >>> y = memoryview(b)
    >>> x == a == y == b
    True
    >>> x.tolist() == a.tolist() == y.tolist() == b.tolist()
    True
    >>> z = y[::-2]
    >>> z == c
    True
    >>> z.tolist() == c.tolist()
    True
    
If either format string is not supported by the `struct` module, then the
objects will always compare as unequal (even if the format strings and buffer
contents are identical):

    
    >>> from ctypes import BigEndianStructure, c_long
    >>> class BEPoint(BigEndianStructure):
    ...     _fields_ = [("x", c_long), ("y", c_long)]
    ...
    >>> point = BEPoint(100, 200)
    >>> a = memoryview(point)
    >>> b = memoryview(point)
    >>> a == point
    False
    >>> a == b
    False
    
Note that, as with floating point numbers, `v is w` does not imply `v == w`
for memoryview objects.

Changed in version 3.3: Previous versions compared the raw memory disregarding
the item format and the logical array structure.

`tobytes(order=None)`

    
Return the data in the buffer as a bytestring. This is equivalent to calling
the `bytes` constructor on the memoryview.

    
    >>> m = memoryview(b"abc")
    >>> m.tobytes()
    b'abc'
    >>> bytes(m)
    b'abc'
    
For non-contiguous arrays the result is equal to the flattened list
representation with all elements converted to bytes. `tobytes()` supports all
format strings, including those that are not in `struct` module syntax.

New in version 3.8: order can be {‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’}. When order is ‘C’ or ‘F’,
the data of the original array is converted to C or Fortran order. For
contiguous views, ‘A’ returns an exact copy of the physical memory. In
particular, in-memory Fortran order is preserved. For non-contiguous views,
the data is converted to C first. order=None is the same as order=’C’.

`hex([sep[, bytes_per_sep]])`

    
Return a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte in the
buffer.

    
    >>> m = memoryview(b"abc")
    >>> m.hex()
    '616263'
    
New in version 3.5.

Changed in version 3.8: Similar to `bytes.hex()`, `memoryview.hex()` now
supports optional sep and bytes_per_sep parameters to insert separators
between bytes in the hex output.

`tolist()`

    
Return the data in the buffer as a list of elements.

    
    >>> memoryview(b'abc').tolist()
    [97, 98, 99]
    >>> import array
    >>> a = array.array('d', [1.1, 2.2, 3.3])
    >>> m = memoryview(a)
    >>> m.tolist()
    [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]
    
Changed in version 3.3: `tolist()` now supports all single character native
formats in `struct` module syntax as well as multi-dimensional
representations.

`toreadonly()`

    
Return a readonly version of the memoryview object. The original memoryview
object is unchanged.

    
    >>> m = memoryview(bytearray(b'abc'))
    >>> mm = m.toreadonly()
    >>> mm.tolist()
    [89, 98, 99]
    >>> mm[0] = 42
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: cannot modify read-only memory
    >>> m[0] = 43
    >>> mm.tolist()
    [43, 98, 99]
    
New in version 3.8.

`release()`

    
Release the underlying buffer exposed by the memoryview object. Many objects
take special actions when a view is held on them (for example, a `bytearray`
would temporarily forbid resizing); therefore, calling release() is handy to
remove these restrictions (and free any dangling resources) as soon as
possible.

After this method has been called, any further operation on the view raises a
`ValueError` (except `release()` itself which can be called multiple times):

    
    >>> m = memoryview(b'abc')
    >>> m.release()
    >>> m[0]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ValueError: operation forbidden on released memoryview object
    
The context management protocol can be used for a similar effect, using the
`with` statement:

    
    >>> with memoryview(b'abc') as m:
    ...     m[0]
    ...
    97
    >>> m[0]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ValueError: operation forbidden on released memoryview object
    
New in version 3.2.

`cast(format[, shape])`

    
Cast a memoryview to a new format or shape. shape defaults to
`[byte_length//new_itemsize]`, which means that the result view will be one-
dimensional. The return value is a new memoryview, but the buffer itself is
not copied. Supported casts are 1D -> C-contiguous and C-contiguous -> 1D.

The destination format is restricted to a single element native format in
`struct` syntax. One of the formats must be a byte format (‘B’, ‘b’ or ‘c’).
The byte length of the result must be the same as the original length.

Cast 1D/long to 1D/unsigned bytes:

    
    >>> import array
    >>> a = array.array('l', [1,2,3])
    >>> x = memoryview(a)
    >>> x.format
    'l'
    >>> x.itemsize
    8
    >>> len(x)
    3
    >>> x.nbytes
    24
    >>> y = x.cast('B')
    >>> y.format
    'B'
    >>> y.itemsize
    1
    >>> len(y)
    24
    >>> y.nbytes
    24
    
Cast 1D/unsigned bytes to 1D/char:

    
    >>> b = bytearray(b'zyz')
    >>> x = memoryview(b)
    >>> x[0] = b'a'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ValueError: memoryview: invalid value for format "B"
    >>> y = x.cast('c')
    >>> y[0] = b'a'
    >>> b
    bytearray(b'ayz')
    
Cast 1D/bytes to 3D/ints to 1D/signed char:

    
    >>> import struct
    >>> buf = struct.pack("i"*12, *list(range(12)))
    >>> x = memoryview(buf)
    >>> y = x.cast('i', shape=[2,2,3])
    >>> y.tolist()
    [[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]], [[6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11]]]
    >>> y.format
    'i'
    >>> y.itemsize
    4
    >>> len(y)
    2
    >>> y.nbytes
    48
    >>> z = y.cast('b')
    >>> z.format
    'b'
    >>> z.itemsize
    1
    >>> len(z)
    48
    >>> z.nbytes
    48
    
Cast 1D/unsigned long to 2D/unsigned long:

    
    >>> buf = struct.pack("L"*6, *list(range(6)))
    >>> x = memoryview(buf)
    >>> y = x.cast('L', shape=[2,3])
    >>> len(y)
    2
    >>> y.nbytes
    48
    >>> y.tolist()
    [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
    
New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.5: The source format is no longer restricted when casting
to a byte view.

There are also several readonly attributes available:

`obj`

    
The underlying object of the memoryview:

    
    >>> b  = bytearray(b'xyz')
    >>> m = memoryview(b)
    >>> m.obj is b
    True
    
New in version 3.3.

`nbytes`

    
`nbytes == product(shape) * itemsize == len(m.tobytes())`. This is the amount
of space in bytes that the array would use in a contiguous representation. It
is not necessarily equal to `len(m)`:

    
    >>> import array
    >>> a = array.array('i', [1,2,3,4,5])
    >>> m = memoryview(a)
    >>> len(m)
    5
    >>> m.nbytes
    20
    >>> y = m[::2]
    >>> len(y)
    3
    >>> y.nbytes
    12
    >>> len(y.tobytes())
    12
    
Multi-dimensional arrays:

    
    >>> import struct
    >>> buf = struct.pack("d"*12, *[1.5*x for x in range(12)])
    >>> x = memoryview(buf)
    >>> y = x.cast('d', shape=[3,4])
    >>> y.tolist()
    [[0.0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5], [6.0, 7.5, 9.0, 10.5], [12.0, 13.5, 15.0, 16.5]]
    >>> len(y)
    3
    >>> y.nbytes
    96
    
New in version 3.3.

`readonly`

    
A bool indicating whether the memory is read only.

`format`

    
A string containing the format (in `struct` module style) for each element in
the view. A memoryview can be created from exporters with arbitrary format
strings, but some methods (e.g. `tolist()`) are restricted to native single
element formats.

Changed in version 3.3: format `'B'` is now handled according to the struct
module syntax. This means that `memoryview(b'abc')[0] == b'abc'[0] == 97`.

`itemsize`

    
The size in bytes of each element of the memoryview:

    
    >>> import array, struct
    >>> m = memoryview(array.array('H', [32000, 32001, 32002]))
    >>> m.itemsize
    2
    >>> m[0]
    32000
    >>> struct.calcsize('H') == m.itemsize
    True
    
`ndim`

    
An integer indicating how many dimensions of a multi-dimensional array the
memory represents.

`shape`

    
A tuple of integers the length of `ndim` giving the shape of the memory as an
N-dimensional array.

Changed in version 3.3: An empty tuple instead of `None` when ndim = 0.

`strides`

    
A tuple of integers the length of `ndim` giving the size in bytes to access
each element for each dimension of the array.

Changed in version 3.3: An empty tuple instead of `None` when ndim = 0.

`suboffsets`

    
Used internally for PIL-style arrays. The value is informational only.

`c_contiguous`

    
A bool indicating whether the memory is C-contiguous.

New in version 3.3.

`f_contiguous`

    
A bool indicating whether the memory is Fortran contiguous.

New in version 3.3.

`contiguous`

    
A bool indicating whether the memory is contiguous.

New in version 3.3.

## Set Types — set, frozenset

A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. Common
uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and
computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and
symmetric difference. (For other containers see the built-in `dict`, `list`,
and `tuple` classes, and the `collections` module.)

Like other collections, sets support `x in set`, `len(set)`, and `for x in
set`. Being an unordered collection, sets do not record element position or
order of insertion. Accordingly, sets do not support indexing, slicing, or
other sequence-like behavior.

There are currently two built-in set types, `set` and `frozenset`. The `set`
type is mutable — the contents can be changed using methods like `add()` and
`remove()`. Since it is mutable, it has no hash value and cannot be used as
either a dictionary key or as an element of another set. The `frozenset` type
is immutable and hashable — its contents cannot be altered after it is
created; it can therefore be used as a dictionary key or as an element of
another set.

Non-empty sets (not frozensets) can be created by placing a comma-separated
list of elements within braces, for example: `{'jack', 'sjoerd'}`, in addition
to the `set` constructor.

The constructors for both classes work the same:

`class set([iterable])`

`class frozenset([iterable])`

    
Return a new set or frozenset object whose elements are taken from iterable.
The elements of a set must be hashable. To represent sets of sets, the inner
sets must be `frozenset` objects. If iterable is not specified, a new empty
set is returned.

Sets can be created by several means:

  * Use a comma-separated list of elements within braces: `{'jack', 'sjoerd'}`
  * Use a set comprehension: `{c for c in 'abracadabra' if c not in 'abc'}`
  * Use the type constructor: `set()`, `set('foobar')`, `set(['a', 'b', 'foo'])`

Instances of `set` and `frozenset` provide the following operations:

`len(s)`

    
Return the number of elements in set s (cardinality of s).

`x in s`

    
Test x for membership in s.

`x not in s`

    
Test x for non-membership in s.

`isdisjoint(other)`

    
Return `True` if the set has no elements in common with other. Sets are
disjoint if and only if their intersection is the empty set.

`issubset(other)`

`set <= other`

    
Test whether every element in the set is in other.

`set < other`

    
Test whether the set is a proper subset of other, that is, `set <= other and
set != other`.

`issuperset(other)`

`set >= other`

    
Test whether every element in other is in the set.

`set > other`

    
Test whether the set is a proper superset of other, that is, `set >= other and
set != other`.

`union(*others)`

`set | other | ...`
    
Return a new set with elements from the set and all others.

`intersection(*others)`

`set & other & ...`

    
Return a new set with elements common to the set and all others.

`difference(*others)`

`set - other - ...`

    
Return a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others.

`symmetric_difference(other)`

`set ^ other`

    
Return a new set with elements in either the set or other but not both.

`copy()`

    
Return a shallow copy of the set.

Note, the non-operator versions of `union()`, `intersection()`,
`difference()`, and `symmetric_difference()`, `issubset()`, and `issuperset()`
methods will accept any iterable as an argument. In contrast, their operator
based counterparts require their arguments to be sets. This precludes error-
prone constructions like `set('abc') & 'cbs'` in favor of the more readable
`set('abc').intersection('cbs')`.

Both `set` and `frozenset` support set to set comparisons. Two sets are equal
if and only if every element of each set is contained in the other (each is a
subset of the other). A set is less than another set if and only if the first
set is a proper subset of the second set (is a subset, but is not equal). A
set is greater than another set if and only if the first set is a proper
superset of the second set (is a superset, but is not equal).

Instances of `set` are compared to instances of `frozenset` based on their
members. For example, `set('abc') == frozenset('abc')` returns `True` and so
does `set('abc') in set([frozenset('abc')])`.

The subset and equality comparisons do not generalize to a total ordering
function. For example, any two nonempty disjoint sets are not equal and are
not subsets of each other, so all of the following return `False`: `a<b`,
`a==b`, or `a>b`.

Since sets only define partial ordering (subset relationships), the output of
the `list.sort()` method is undefined for lists of sets.

Set elements, like dictionary keys, must be hashable.

Binary operations that mix `set` instances with `frozenset` return the type of the first operand. For example: `frozenset('ab') | set('bc')` returns an instance of `frozenset`.
The following table lists operations available for `set` that do not apply to
immutable instances of `frozenset`:

`update(*others)`

`set |= other | ...`
    
Update the set, adding elements from all others.

`intersection_update(*others)`

`set &= other & ...`

    
Update the set, keeping only elements found in it and all others.

`difference_update(*others)`

`set -= other | ...`
    
Update the set, removing elements found in others.

`symmetric_difference_update(other)`

`set ^= other`

    
Update the set, keeping only elements found in either set, but not in both.

`add(elem)`

    
Add element elem to the set.

`remove(elem)`

    
Remove element elem from the set. Raises `KeyError` if elem is not contained
in the set.

`discard(elem)`

    
Remove element elem from the set if it is present.

`pop()`

    
Remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. Raises `KeyError` if the
set is empty.

`clear()`

    
Remove all elements from the set.

Note, the non-operator versions of the `update()`, `intersection_update()`,
`difference_update()`, and `symmetric_difference_update()` methods will accept
any iterable as an argument.

Note, the elem argument to the `__contains__()`, `remove()`, and `discard()`
methods may be a set. To support searching for an equivalent frozenset, a
temporary one is created from elem.

## Mapping Types — dict

A mapping object maps hashable values to arbitrary objects. Mappings are
mutable objects. There is currently only one standard mapping type, the
dictionary. (For other containers see the built-in `list`, `set`, and `tuple`
classes, and the `collections` module.)

A dictionary’s keys are almost arbitrary values. Values that are not hashable,
that is, values containing lists, dictionaries or other mutable types (that
are compared by value rather than by object identity) may not be used as keys.
Numeric types used for keys obey the normal rules for numeric comparison: if
two numbers compare equal (such as `1` and `1.0`) then they can be used
interchangeably to index the same dictionary entry. (Note however, that since
computers store floating-point numbers as approximations it is usually unwise
to use them as dictionary keys.)

Dictionaries can be created by placing a comma-separated list of `key: value`
pairs within braces, for example: `{'jack': 4098, 'sjoerd': 4127}` or `{4098:
'jack', 4127: 'sjoerd'}`, or by the `dict` constructor.

`class dict(**kwarg)`

`class dict(mapping, **kwarg)`

`class dict(iterable, **kwarg)`

    
Return a new dictionary initialized from an optional positional argument and a
possibly empty set of keyword arguments.

Dictionaries can be created by several means:

  * Use a comma-separated list of `key: value` pairs within braces: `{'jack': 4098, 'sjoerd': 4127}` or `{4098: 'jack', 4127: 'sjoerd'}`
  * Use a dict comprehension: `{}`, `{x: x ** 2 for x in range(10)}`
  * Use the type constructor: `dict()`, `dict([('foo', 100), ('bar', 200)])`, `dict(foo=100, bar=200)`

If no positional argument is given, an empty dictionary is created. If a
positional argument is given and it is a mapping object, a dictionary is
created with the same key-value pairs as the mapping object. Otherwise, the
positional argument must be an iterable object. Each item in the iterable must
itself be an iterable with exactly two objects. The first object of each item
becomes a key in the new dictionary, and the second object the corresponding
value. If a key occurs more than once, the last value for that key becomes the
corresponding value in the new dictionary.

If keyword arguments are given, the keyword arguments and their values are
added to the dictionary created from the positional argument. If a key being
added is already present, the value from the keyword argument replaces the
value from the positional argument.

To illustrate, the following examples all return a dictionary equal to
`{"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}`:

    
    >>> a = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3)
    >>> b = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
    >>> c = dict(zip(['one', 'two', 'three'], [1, 2, 3]))
    >>> d = dict([('two', 2), ('one', 1), ('three', 3)])
    >>> e = dict({'three': 3, 'one': 1, 'two': 2})
    >>> f = dict({'one': 1, 'three': 3}, two=2)
    >>> a == b == c == d == e == f
    True
    
Providing keyword arguments as in the first example only works for keys that
are valid Python identifiers. Otherwise, any valid keys can be used.

These are the operations that dictionaries support (and therefore, custom
mapping types should support too):

`list(d)`

    
Return a list of all the keys used in the dictionary d.

`len(d)`

    
Return the number of items in the dictionary d.

`d[key]`

    
Return the item of d with key key. Raises a `KeyError` if key is not in the
map.

If a subclass of dict defines a method `__missing__()` and key is not present,
the `d[key]` operation calls that method with the key key as argument. The
`d[key]` operation then returns or raises whatever is returned or raised by
the `__missing__(key)` call. No other operations or methods invoke
`__missing__()`. If `__missing__()` is not defined, `KeyError` is raised.
`__missing__()` must be a method; it cannot be an instance variable:

    
    >>> class Counter(dict):
    ...     def __missing__(self, key):
    ...         return 0
    >>> c = Counter()
    >>> c['red']
    0
    >>> c['red'] += 1
    >>> c['red']
    1
    
The example above shows part of the implementation of `collections.Counter`. A
different `__missing__` method is used by `collections.defaultdict`.

`d[key] = value`

    
Set `d[key]` to value.

`del d[key]`

    
Remove `d[key]` from d. Raises a `KeyError` if key is not in the map.

`key in d`

    
Return `True` if d has a key key, else `False`.

`key not in d`

    
Equivalent to `not key in d`.

`iter(d)`

    
Return an iterator over the keys of the dictionary. This is a shortcut for
`iter(d.keys())`.

`clear()`

    
Remove all items from the dictionary.

`copy()`

    
Return a shallow copy of the dictionary.

`classmethod fromkeys(iterable[, value])`

    
Create a new dictionary with keys from iterable and values set to value.

`fromkeys()` is a class method that returns a new dictionary. value defaults
to `None`. All of the values refer to just a single instance, so it generally
doesn’t make sense for value to be a mutable object such as an empty list. To
get distinct values, use a dict comprehension instead.

`get(key[, default])`

    
Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default
is not given, it defaults to `None`, so that this method never raises a
`KeyError`.

`items()`

    
Return a new view of the dictionary’s items (`(key, value)` pairs). See the
documentation of view objects.

`keys()`

    
Return a new view of the dictionary’s keys. See the documentation of view
objects.

`pop(key[, default])`

    
If key is in the dictionary, remove it and return its value, else return
default. If default is not given and key is not in the dictionary, a
`KeyError` is raised.

`popitem()`

    
Remove and return a `(key, value)` pair from the dictionary. Pairs are
returned in LIFO order.

`popitem()` is useful to destructively iterate over a dictionary, as often
used in set algorithms. If the dictionary is empty, calling `popitem()` raises
a `KeyError`.

Changed in version 3.7: LIFO order is now guaranteed. In prior versions,
`popitem()` would return an arbitrary key/value pair.

`reversed(d)`

    
Return a reverse iterator over the keys of the dictionary. This is a shortcut
for `reversed(d.keys())`.

New in version 3.8.

`setdefault(key[, default])`

    
If key is in the dictionary, return its value. If not, insert key with a value
of default and return default. default defaults to `None`.

`update([other])`

    
Update the dictionary with the key/value pairs from other, overwriting
existing keys. Return `None`.

`update()` accepts either another dictionary object or an iterable of
key/value pairs (as tuples or other iterables of length two). If keyword
arguments are specified, the dictionary is then updated with those key/value
pairs: `d.update(red=1, blue=2)`.

`values()`

    
Return a new view of the dictionary’s values. See the documentation of view
objects.

An equality comparison between one `dict.values()` view and another will
always return `False`. This also applies when comparing `dict.values()` to
itself:

    
    >>> d = {'a': 1}
    >>> d.values() == d.values()
    False
    
`d | other`
    
Create a new dictionary with the merged keys and values of d and other, which
must both be dictionaries. The values of other take priority when d and other
share keys.

New in version 3.9.

`d |= other`

    
Update the dictionary d with keys and values from other, which may be either a
mapping or an iterable of key/value pairs. The values of other take priority
when d and other share keys.

New in version 3.9.

Dictionaries compare equal if and only if they have the same `(key, value)`
pairs (regardless of ordering). Order comparisons (‘<’, ‘<=’, ‘>=’, ‘>’) raise
`TypeError`.

Dictionaries preserve insertion order. Note that updating a key does not
affect the order. Keys added after deletion are inserted at the end.

    
    >>> d = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4}
    >>> d
    {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}
    >>> list(d)
    ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
    >>> list(d.values())
    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> d["one"] = 42
    >>> d
    {'one': 42, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}
    >>> del d["two"]
    >>> d["two"] = None
    >>> d
    {'one': 42, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'two': None}
    
Changed in version 3.7: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order.
This behavior was an implementation detail of CPython from 3.6.

Dictionaries and dictionary views are reversible.

    
    >>> d = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4}
    >>> d
    {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}
    >>> list(reversed(d))
    ['four', 'three', 'two', 'one']
    >>> list(reversed(d.values()))
    [4, 3, 2, 1]
    >>> list(reversed(d.items()))
    [('four', 4), ('three', 3), ('two', 2), ('one', 1)]
    
Changed in version 3.8: Dictionaries are now reversible.

See also

`types.MappingProxyType` can be used to create a read-only view of a `dict`.

### Dictionary view objects

The objects returned by `dict.keys()`, `dict.values()` and `dict.items()` are
view objects. They provide a dynamic view on the dictionary’s entries, which
means that when the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes.

Dictionary views can be iterated over to yield their respective data, and
support membership tests:

`len(dictview)`

    
Return the number of entries in the dictionary.

`iter(dictview)`

    
Return an iterator over the keys, values or items (represented as tuples of
`(key, value)`) in the dictionary.

Keys and values are iterated over in insertion order. This allows the creation
of `(value, key)` pairs using `zip()`: `pairs = zip(d.values(), d.keys())`.
Another way to create the same list is `pairs = [(v, k) for (k, v) in
d.items()]`.

Iterating views while adding or deleting entries in the dictionary may raise a
`RuntimeError` or fail to iterate over all entries.

Changed in version 3.7: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order.

`x in dictview`

    
Return `True` if x is in the underlying dictionary’s keys, values or items (in
the latter case, x should be a `(key, value)` tuple).

`reversed(dictview)`

    
Return a reverse iterator over the keys, values or items of the dictionary.
The view will be iterated in reverse order of the insertion.

Changed in version 3.8: Dictionary views are now reversible.

Keys views are set-like since their entries are unique and hashable. If all
values are hashable, so that `(key, value)` pairs are unique and hashable,
then the items view is also set-like. (Values views are not treated as set-
like since the entries are generally not unique.) For set-like views, all of
the operations defined for the abstract base class `collections.abc.Set` are
available (for example, `==`, `<`, or `^`).

An example of dictionary view usage:

    
    >>> dishes = {'eggs': 2, 'sausage': 1, 'bacon': 1, 'spam': 500}
    >>> keys = dishes.keys()
    >>> values = dishes.values()
    
    >>> # iteration
    >>> n = 0
    >>> for val in values:
    ...     n += val
    >>> print(n)
    504
    
    >>> # keys and values are iterated over in the same order (insertion order)
    >>> list(keys)
    ['eggs', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam']
    >>> list(values)
    [2, 1, 1, 500]
    
    >>> # view objects are dynamic and reflect dict changes
    >>> del dishes['eggs']
    >>> del dishes['sausage']
    >>> list(keys)
    ['bacon', 'spam']
    
    >>> # set operations
    >>> keys & {'eggs', 'bacon', 'salad'}
    {'bacon'}
    >>> keys ^ {'sausage', 'juice'}
    {'juice', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam'}
    
## Context Manager Types

Python’s `with` statement supports the concept of a runtime context defined by
a context manager. This is implemented using a pair of methods that allow
user-defined classes to define a runtime context that is entered before the
statement body is executed and exited when the statement ends:

`contextmanager.__enter__()`

    
Enter the runtime context and return either this object or another object
related to the runtime context. The value returned by this method is bound to
the identifier in the `as` clause of `with` statements using this context
manager.

An example of a context manager that returns itself is a file object. File
objects return themselves from __enter__() to allow `open()` to be used as the
context expression in a `with` statement.

An example of a context manager that returns a related object is the one
returned by `decimal.localcontext()`. These managers set the active decimal
context to a copy of the original decimal context and then return the copy.
This allows changes to be made to the current decimal context in the body of
the `with` statement without affecting code outside the `with` statement.

`contextmanager.__exit__(exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)`

    
Exit the runtime context and return a Boolean flag indicating if any exception
that occurred should be suppressed. If an exception occurred while executing
the body of the `with` statement, the arguments contain the exception type,
value and traceback information. Otherwise, all three arguments are `None`.

Returning a true value from this method will cause the `with` statement to
suppress the exception and continue execution with the statement immediately
following the `with` statement. Otherwise the exception continues propagating
after this method has finished executing. Exceptions that occur during
execution of this method will replace any exception that occurred in the body
of the `with` statement.

The exception passed in should never be reraised explicitly - instead, this
method should return a false value to indicate that the method completed
successfully and does not want to suppress the raised exception. This allows
context management code to easily detect whether or not an `__exit__()` method
has actually failed.

Python defines several context managers to support easy thread
synchronisation, prompt closure of files or other objects, and simpler
manipulation of the active decimal arithmetic context. The specific types are
not treated specially beyond their implementation of the context management
protocol. See the `contextlib` module for some examples.

Python’s generators and the `contextlib.contextmanager` decorator provide a
convenient way to implement these protocols. If a generator function is
decorated with the `contextlib.contextmanager` decorator, it will return a
context manager implementing the necessary `__enter__()` and `__exit__()`
methods, rather than the iterator produced by an undecorated generator
function.

Note that there is no specific slot for any of these methods in the type
structure for Python objects in the Python/C API. Extension types wanting to
define these methods must provide them as a normal Python accessible method.
Compared to the overhead of setting up the runtime context, the overhead of a
single class dictionary lookup is negligible.

## Generic Alias Type

`GenericAlias` objects are created by subscripting a class (usually a
container), such as `list[int]`. They are intended primarily for type
annotations.

Usually, the subscription of container objects calls the method
`__getitem__()` of the object. However, the subscription of some containers’
classes may call the classmethod `__class_getitem__()` of the class instead.
The classmethod `__class_getitem__()` should return a `GenericAlias` object.

Note

If the `__getitem__()` of the class’ metaclass is present, it will take
precedence over the `__class_getitem__()` defined in the class (see PEP 560
for more details).

The `GenericAlias` object acts as a proxy for generic types, implementing
parameterized generics \- a specific instance of a generic which provides the
types for container elements.

The user-exposed type for the `GenericAlias` object can be accessed from
`types.GenericAlias` and used for `isinstance()` checks. It can also be used
to create `GenericAlias` objects directly.

`T[X, Y, ...]`

    
Creates a `GenericAlias` representing a type `T` containing elements of types
X, Y, and more depending on the `T` used. For example, a function expecting a
`list` containing `float` elements:

    
    def average(values: list[float]) -> float:
        return sum(values) / len(values)
    
Another example for mapping objects, using a `dict`, which is a generic type
expecting two type parameters representing the key type and the value type. In
this example, the function expects a `dict` with keys of type `str` and values
of type `int`:

    
    def send_post_request(url: str, body: dict[str, int]) -> None:
        ...
    
The builtin functions `isinstance()` and `issubclass()` do not accept
`GenericAlias` types for their second argument:

    
    >>> isinstance([1, 2], list[str])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: isinstance() argument 2 cannot be a parameterized generic
    
The Python runtime does not enforce type annotations. This extends to generic
types and their type parameters. When creating an object from a
`GenericAlias`, container elements are not checked against their type. For
example, the following code is discouraged, but will run without errors:

    
    >>> t = list[str]
    >>> t([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    
Furthermore, parameterized generics erase type parameters during object
creation:

    
    >>> t = list[str]
    >>> type(t)
    <class 'types.GenericAlias'>
    
    >>> l = t()
    >>> type(l)
    <class 'list'>
    
Calling `repr()` or `str()` on a generic shows the parameterized type:

    
    >>> repr(list[int])
    'list[int]'
    
    >>> str(list[int])
    'list[int]'
    
The `__getitem__()` method of generics will raise an exception to disallow
mistakes like `dict[str][str]`:

    
    >>> dict[str][str]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: There are no type variables left in dict[str]
    
However, such expressions are valid when type variables are used. The index
must have as many elements as there are type variable items in the
`GenericAlias` object’s `__args__`.

    
    >>> from typing import TypeVar
    >>> Y = TypeVar('Y')
    >>> dict[str, Y][int]
    dict[str, int]

### Special Attributes of Generic Alias

All parameterized generics implement special read-only attributes.

`genericalias.__origin__`

    
This attribute points at the non-parameterized generic class:

    
    >>> list[int].__origin__
    <class 'list'>
    
`genericalias.__args__`

    
This attribute is a `tuple` (possibly of length 1) of generic types passed to
the original `__class_getitem__()` of the generic container:

    
    >>> dict[str, list[int]].__args__
    (<class 'str'>, list[int])
    
`genericalias.__parameters__`

    
This attribute is a lazily computed tuple (possibly empty) of unique type
variables found in `__args__`:

    
    >>> from typing import TypeVar
    
    >>> T = TypeVar('T')
    >>> list[T].__parameters__
    (~T,)

  * Generics – Generics in the `typing` module.

New in version 3.9.

## Other Built-in Types

The interpreter supports several other kinds of objects. Most of these support
only one or two operations.

### Modules

The only special operation on a module is attribute access: `m.name`, where m
is a module and name accesses a name defined in m’s symbol table. Module
attributes can be assigned to. (Note that the `import` statement is not,
strictly speaking, an operation on a module object; `import foo` does not
require a module object named foo to exist, rather it requires an (external)
definition for a module named foo somewhere.)

A special attribute of every module is `__dict__`. This is the dictionary
containing the module’s symbol table. Modifying this dictionary will actually
change the module’s symbol table, but direct assignment to the `__dict__`
attribute is not possible (you can write `m.__dict__['a'] = 1`, which defines
`m.a` to be `1`, but you can’t write `m.__dict__ = {}`). Modifying `__dict__`
directly is not recommended.

Modules built into the interpreter are written like this: `<module 'sys'
(built-in)>`. If loaded from a file, they are written as `<module 'os' from
'/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/os.pyc'>`.

### Classes and Class Instances

See Objects, values and types and Class definitions for these.

### Functions

Function objects are created by function definitions. The only operation on a
function object is to call it: `func(argument-list)`.

There are really two flavors of function objects: built-in functions and user-
defined functions. Both support the same operation (to call the function), but
the implementation is different, hence the different object types.

See Function definitions for more information.

### Methods

Methods are functions that are called using the attribute notation. There are
two flavors: built-in methods (such as `append()` on lists) and class instance
methods. Built-in methods are described with the types that support them.

If you access a method (a function defined in a class namespace) through an
instance, you get a special object: a bound method (also called instance
method) object. When called, it will add the `self` argument to the argument
list. Bound methods have two special read-only attributes: `m.__self__` is the
object on which the method operates, and `m.__func__` is the function
implementing the method. Calling `m(arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n)` is completely
equivalent to calling `m.__func__(m.__self__, arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n)`.

Like function objects, bound method objects support getting arbitrary
attributes. However, since method attributes are actually stored on the
underlying function object (`meth.__func__`), setting method attributes on
bound methods is disallowed. Attempting to set an attribute on a method
results in an `AttributeError` being raised. In order to set a method
attribute, you need to explicitly set it on the underlying function object:

    
    >>> class C:
    ...     def method(self):
    ...         pass
    ...
    >>> c = C()
    >>> c.method.whoami = 'my name is method'  # can't set on the method
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: 'method' object has no attribute 'whoami'
    >>> c.method.__func__.whoami = 'my name is method'
    >>> c.method.whoami
    'my name is method'
    
See The standard type hierarchy for more information.

### Code Objects

Code objects are used by the implementation to represent “pseudo-compiled”
executable Python code such as a function body. They differ from function
objects because they don’t contain a reference to their global execution
environment. Code objects are returned by the built-in `compile()` function
and can be extracted from function objects through their `__code__` attribute.
See also the `code` module.

A code object can be executed or evaluated by passing it (instead of a source
string) to the `exec()` or `eval()` built-in functions.

See The standard type hierarchy for more information.

### Type Objects

Type objects represent the various object types. An object’s type is accessed
by the built-in function `type()`. There are no special operations on types.
The standard module `types` defines names for all standard built-in types.

Types are written like this: `<class 'int'>`.

### The Null Object

This object is returned by functions that don’t explicitly return a value. It
supports no special operations. There is exactly one null object, named `None`
(a built-in name). `type(None)()` produces the same singleton.

It is written as `None`.

### The Ellipsis Object

This object is commonly used by slicing (see Slicings). It supports no special
operations. There is exactly one ellipsis object, named `Ellipsis` (a built-in
name). `type(Ellipsis)()` produces the `Ellipsis` singleton.

It is written as `Ellipsis` or `...`.

### The NotImplemented Object

This object is returned from comparisons and binary operations when they are
asked to operate on types they don’t support. See Comparisons for more
information. There is exactly one `NotImplemented` object.
`type(NotImplemented)()` produces the singleton instance.

It is written as `NotImplemented`.

### Boolean Values

Boolean values are the two constant objects `False` and `True`. They are used
to represent truth values (although other values can also be considered false
or true). In numeric contexts (for example when used as the argument to an
arithmetic operator), they behave like the integers 0 and 1, respectively. The
built-in function `bool()` can be used to convert any value to a Boolean, if
the value can be interpreted as a truth value (see section Truth Value Testing
above).

They are written as `False` and `True`, respectively.

### Internal Objects

See The standard type hierarchy for this information. It describes stack frame
objects, traceback objects, and slice objects.

## Special Attributes

The implementation adds a few special read-only attributes to several object
types, where they are relevant. Some of these are not reported by the `dir()`
built-in function.

`object.__dict__`

    
A dictionary or other mapping object used to store an object’s (writable)
attributes.

`instance.__class__`

    
The class to which a class instance belongs.

`class.__bases__`

    
The tuple of base classes of a class object.

`definition.__name__`

    
The name of the class, function, method, descriptor, or generator instance.

`definition.__qualname__`

    
The qualified name of the class, function, method, descriptor, or generator
instance.

New in version 3.3.

`class.__mro__`

    
This attribute is a tuple of classes that are considered when looking for base
classes during method resolution.

`class.mro()`

    
This method can be overridden by a metaclass to customize the method
resolution order for its instances. It is called at class instantiation, and
its result is stored in `__mro__`.

`class.__subclasses__()`

    
Each class keeps a list of weak references to its immediate subclasses. This
method returns a list of all those references still alive. The list is in
definition order. Example:

    
    >>> int.__subclasses__()
    [<class 'bool'>]
    
#### Footnotes

`1`

    
Additional information on these special methods may be found in the Python
Reference Manual (Basic customization).

`2`

    
As a consequence, the list `[1, 2]` is considered equal to `[1.0, 2.0]`, and
similarly for tuples.

`3`

    
They must have since the parser can’t tell the type of the operands.

`4(1,2,3,4)`

    
Cased characters are those with general category property being one of “Lu”
(Letter, uppercase), “Ll” (Letter, lowercase), or “Lt” (Letter, titlecase).

`5(1,2)`

    
To format only a tuple you should therefore provide a singleton tuple whose
