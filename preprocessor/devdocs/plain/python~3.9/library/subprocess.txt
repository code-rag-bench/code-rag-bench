# subprocess — Subprocess management

Source code: Lib/subprocess.py

The `subprocess` module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their
input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. This module intends
to replace several older modules and functions:

    
    os.system
    os.spawn*
    
Information about how the `subprocess` module can be used to replace these
modules and functions can be found in the following sections.

PEP 324 – PEP proposing the subprocess module

## Using the subprocess Module

The recommended approach to invoking subprocesses is to use the `run()`
function for all use cases it can handle. For more advanced use cases, the
underlying `Popen` interface can be used directly.

The `run()` function was added in Python 3.5; if you need to retain
compatibility with older versions, see the Older high-level API section.

`subprocess.run(args, *, stdin=None, input=None, stdout=None, stderr=None,
capture_output=False, shell=False, cwd=None, timeout=None, check=False,
encoding=None, errors=None, text=None, env=None, universal_newlines=None,
**other_popen_kwargs)`

    
Run the command described by args. Wait for command to complete, then return a
`CompletedProcess` instance.

The arguments shown above are merely the most common ones, described below in
Frequently Used Arguments (hence the use of keyword-only notation in the
abbreviated signature). The full function signature is largely the same as
that of the `Popen` constructor - most of the arguments to this function are
passed through to that interface. (timeout, input, check, and capture_output
are not.)

If capture_output is true, stdout and stderr will be captured. When used, the
internal `Popen` object is automatically created with `stdout=PIPE` and
`stderr=PIPE`. The stdout and stderr arguments may not be supplied at the same
time as capture_output. If you wish to capture and combine both streams into
one, use `stdout=PIPE` and `stderr=STDOUT` instead of capture_output.

The timeout argument is passed to `Popen.communicate()`. If the timeout
expires, the child process will be killed and waited for. The `TimeoutExpired`
exception will be re-raised after the child process has terminated.

The input argument is passed to `Popen.communicate()` and thus to the
subprocess’s stdin. If used it must be a byte sequence, or a string if
encoding or errors is specified or text is true. When used, the internal
`Popen` object is automatically created with `stdin=PIPE`, and the stdin
argument may not be used as well.

If check is true, and the process exits with a non-zero exit code, a
`CalledProcessError` exception will be raised. Attributes of that exception
hold the arguments, the exit code, and stdout and stderr if they were
captured.

If encoding or errors are specified, or text is true, file objects for stdin,
stdout and stderr are opened in text mode using the specified encoding and
errors or the `io.TextIOWrapper` default. The universal_newlines argument is
equivalent to text and is provided for backwards compatibility. By default,
file objects are opened in binary mode.

If env is not `None`, it must be a mapping that defines the environment
variables for the new process; these are used instead of the default behavior
of inheriting the current process’ environment. It is passed directly to
`Popen`.

Examples:

    
    >>> subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"])  # doesn't capture output
    CompletedProcess(args=['ls', '-l'], returncode=0)
    
    >>> subprocess.run("exit 1", shell=True, check=True)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command 'exit 1' returned non-zero exit status 1
    
    >>> subprocess.run(["ls", "-l", "/dev/null"], capture_output=True)
    CompletedProcess(args=['ls', '-l', '/dev/null'], returncode=0,
    stdout=b'crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 Jan 23 16:23 /dev/null\n', stderr=b'')
    
New in version 3.5.

Changed in version 3.6: Added encoding and errors parameters

Changed in version 3.7: Added the text parameter, as a more understandable
alias of universal_newlines. Added the capture_output parameter.

`class subprocess.CompletedProcess`

    
The return value from `run()`, representing a process that has finished.

`args`

    
The arguments used to launch the process. This may be a list or a string.

`returncode`

    
Exit status of the child process. Typically, an exit status of 0 indicates
that it ran successfully.

A negative value `-N` indicates that the child was terminated by signal `N`
(POSIX only).

`stdout`

    
Captured stdout from the child process. A bytes sequence, or a string if
`run()` was called with an encoding, errors, or text=True. `None` if stdout
was not captured.

If you ran the process with `stderr=subprocess.STDOUT`, stdout and stderr will
be combined in this attribute, and `stderr` will be `None`.

`stderr`

    
Captured stderr from the child process. A bytes sequence, or a string if
`run()` was called with an encoding, errors, or text=True. `None` if stderr
was not captured.

`check_returncode()`

    
If `returncode` is non-zero, raise a `CalledProcessError`.

New in version 3.5.

`subprocess.DEVNULL`

    
Special value that can be used as the stdin, stdout or stderr argument to
`Popen` and indicates that the special file `os.devnull` will be used.

New in version 3.3.

`subprocess.PIPE`

    
Special value that can be used as the stdin, stdout or stderr argument to
`Popen` and indicates that a pipe to the standard stream should be opened.
Most useful with `Popen.communicate()`.

`subprocess.STDOUT`

    
Special value that can be used as the stderr argument to `Popen` and indicates
that standard error should go into the same handle as standard output.

`exception subprocess.SubprocessError`

    
Base class for all other exceptions from this module.

New in version 3.3.

`exception subprocess.TimeoutExpired`

    
Subclass of `SubprocessError`, raised when a timeout expires while waiting for
a child process.

`cmd`

    
Command that was used to spawn the child process.

`timeout`

    
Timeout in seconds.

`output`

    
Output of the child process if it was captured by `run()` or `check_output()`.
Otherwise, `None`.

`stdout`

    
Alias for output, for symmetry with `stderr`.

`stderr`

    
Stderr output of the child process if it was captured by `run()`. Otherwise,
`None`.

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.5: stdout and stderr attributes added

`exception subprocess.CalledProcessError`

    
Subclass of `SubprocessError`, raised when a process run by `check_call()` or
`check_output()` returns a non-zero exit status.

`returncode`

    
Exit status of the child process. If the process exited due to a signal, this
will be the negative signal number.

`cmd`

    
Command that was used to spawn the child process.

`output`

    
Output of the child process if it was captured by `run()` or `check_output()`.
Otherwise, `None`.

`stdout`

    
Alias for output, for symmetry with `stderr`.

`stderr`

    
Stderr output of the child process if it was captured by `run()`. Otherwise,
`None`.

Changed in version 3.5: stdout and stderr attributes added

### Frequently Used Arguments

To support a wide variety of use cases, the `Popen` constructor (and the
convenience functions) accept a large number of optional arguments. For most
typical use cases, many of these arguments can be safely left at their default
values. The arguments that are most commonly needed are:

args is required for all calls and should be a string, or a sequence of
program arguments. Providing a sequence of arguments is generally preferred,
as it allows the module to take care of any required escaping and quoting of
arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file names). If passing a single string,
either shell must be `True` (see below) or else the string must simply name
the program to be executed without specifying any arguments.

stdin, stdout and stderr specify the executed program’s standard input,
standard output and standard error file handles, respectively. Valid values
are `PIPE`, `DEVNULL`, an existing file descriptor (a positive integer), an
existing file object, and `None`. `PIPE` indicates that a new pipe to the
child should be created. `DEVNULL` indicates that the special file
`os.devnull` will be used. With the default settings of `None`, no redirection
will occur; the child’s file handles will be inherited from the parent.
Additionally, stderr can be `STDOUT`, which indicates that the stderr data
from the child process should be captured into the same file handle as for
stdout.

If encoding or errors are specified, or text (also known as
universal_newlines) is true, the file objects stdin, stdout and stderr will be
opened in text mode using the encoding and errors specified in the call or the
defaults for `io.TextIOWrapper`.

For stdin, line ending characters `'\n'` in the input will be converted to the
default line separator `os.linesep`. For stdout and stderr, all line endings
in the output will be converted to `'\n'`. For more information see the
documentation of the `io.TextIOWrapper` class when the newline argument to its
constructor is `None`.

If text mode is not used, stdin, stdout and stderr will be opened as binary
streams. No encoding or line ending conversion is performed.

New in version 3.6: Added encoding and errors parameters.

New in version 3.7: Added the text parameter as an alias for
universal_newlines.

Note

The newlines attribute of the file objects `Popen.stdin`, `Popen.stdout` and
`Popen.stderr` are not updated by the `Popen.communicate()` method.

If shell is `True`, the specified command will be executed through the shell.
This can be useful if you are using Python primarily for the enhanced control
flow it offers over most system shells and still want convenient access to
other shell features such as shell pipes, filename wildcards, environment
variable expansion, and expansion of `~` to a user’s home directory. However,
note that Python itself offers implementations of many shell-like features (in
particular, `glob`, `fnmatch`, `os.walk()`, `os.path.expandvars()`,
`os.path.expanduser()`, and `shutil`).

Changed in version 3.3: When universal_newlines is `True`, the class uses the
encoding `locale.getpreferredencoding(False)` instead of
`locale.getpreferredencoding()`. See the `io.TextIOWrapper` class for more
information on this change.

Note

Read the Security Considerations section before using `shell=True`.

These options, along with all of the other options, are described in more
detail in the `Popen` constructor documentation.

### Popen Constructor

The underlying process creation and management in this module is handled by
the `Popen` class. It offers a lot of flexibility so that developers are able
to handle the less common cases not covered by the convenience functions.

`class subprocess.Popen(args, bufsize=-1, executable=None, stdin=None,
stdout=None, stderr=None, preexec_fn=None, close_fds=True, shell=False,
cwd=None, env=None, universal_newlines=None, startupinfo=None,
creationflags=0, restore_signals=True, start_new_session=False, pass_fds=(),
*, group=None, extra_groups=None, user=None, umask=-1, encoding=None,
errors=None, text=None)`

    
Execute a child program in a new process. On POSIX, the class uses
`os.execvp()`-like behavior to execute the child program. On Windows, the
class uses the Windows `CreateProcess()` function. The arguments to `Popen`
are as follows.

args should be a sequence of program arguments or else a single string or
path-like object. By default, the program to execute is the first item in args
if args is a sequence. If args is a string, the interpretation is platform-
dependent and described below. See the shell and executable arguments for
additional differences from the default behavior. Unless otherwise stated, it
is recommended to pass args as a sequence.

An example of passing some arguments to an external program as a sequence is:

    
    Popen(["/usr/bin/git", "commit", "-m", "Fixes a bug."])
    
On POSIX, if args is a string, the string is interpreted as the name or path
of the program to execute. However, this can only be done if not passing
arguments to the program.

Note

It may not be obvious how to break a shell command into a sequence of
arguments, especially in complex cases. `shlex.split()` can illustrate how to
determine the correct tokenization for args:

    
    >>> import shlex, subprocess
    >>> command_line = input()
    /bin/vikings -input eggs.txt -output "spam spam.txt" -cmd "echo '$MONEY'"
    >>> args = shlex.split(command_line)
    >>> print(args)
    ['/bin/vikings', '-input', 'eggs.txt', '-output', 'spam spam.txt', '-cmd', "echo '$MONEY'"]
    >>> p = subprocess.Popen(args) # Success!
    
Note in particular that options (such as -input) and arguments (such as
eggs.txt) that are separated by whitespace in the shell go in separate list
elements, while arguments that need quoting or backslash escaping when used in
the shell (such as filenames containing spaces or the echo command shown
above) are single list elements.

On Windows, if args is a sequence, it will be converted to a string in a
manner described in Converting an argument sequence to a string on Windows.
This is because the underlying `CreateProcess()` operates on strings.

Changed in version 3.6: args parameter accepts a path-like object if shell is
`False` and a sequence containing path-like objects on POSIX.

Changed in version 3.8: args parameter accepts a path-like object if shell is
`False` and a sequence containing bytes and path-like objects on Windows.

The shell argument (which defaults to `False`) specifies whether to use the
shell as the program to execute. If shell is `True`, it is recommended to pass
args as a string rather than as a sequence.

On POSIX with `shell=True`, the shell defaults to `/bin/sh`. If args is a
string, the string specifies the command to execute through the shell. This
means that the string must be formatted exactly as it would be when typed at
the shell prompt. This includes, for example, quoting or backslash escaping
filenames with spaces in them. If args is a sequence, the first item specifies
the command string, and any additional items will be treated as additional
arguments to the shell itself. That is to say, `Popen` does the equivalent of:

    
    Popen(['/bin/sh', '-c', args[0], args[1], ...])
    
On Windows with `shell=True`, the `COMSPEC` environment variable specifies the
default shell. The only time you need to specify `shell=True` on Windows is
when the command you wish to execute is built into the shell (e.g. dir or
copy). You do not need `shell=True` to run a batch file or console-based
executable.

Note

Read the Security Considerations section before using `shell=True`.

bufsize will be supplied as the corresponding argument to the `open()`
function when creating the stdin/stdout/stderr pipe file objects:

  * `0` means unbuffered (read and write are one system call and can return short)
  * `1` means line buffered (only usable if `universal_newlines=True` i.e., in a text mode)
  * any other positive value means use a buffer of approximately that size
  * negative bufsize (the default) means the system default of io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE will be used.

Changed in version 3.3.1: bufsize now defaults to -1 to enable buffering by
default to match the behavior that most code expects. In versions prior to
Python 3.2.4 and 3.3.1 it incorrectly defaulted to `0` which was unbuffered
and allowed short reads. This was unintentional and did not match the behavior
of Python 2 as most code expected.

The executable argument specifies a replacement program to execute. It is very
seldom needed. When `shell=False`, executable replaces the program to execute
specified by args. However, the original args is still passed to the program.
Most programs treat the program specified by args as the command name, which
can then be different from the program actually executed. On POSIX, the args
name becomes the display name for the executable in utilities such as ps. If
`shell=True`, on POSIX the executable argument specifies a replacement shell
for the default `/bin/sh`.

Changed in version 3.6: executable parameter accepts a path-like object on
POSIX.

Changed in version 3.8: executable parameter accepts a bytes and path-like
object on Windows.

stdin, stdout and stderr specify the executed program’s standard input,
standard output and standard error file handles, respectively. Valid values
are `PIPE`, `DEVNULL`, an existing file descriptor (a positive integer), an
existing file object, and `None`. `PIPE` indicates that a new pipe to the
child should be created. `DEVNULL` indicates that the special file
`os.devnull` will be used. With the default settings of `None`, no redirection
will occur; the child’s file handles will be inherited from the parent.
Additionally, stderr can be `STDOUT`, which indicates that the stderr data
from the applications should be captured into the same file handle as for
stdout.

If preexec_fn is set to a callable object, this object will be called in the
child process just before the child is executed. (POSIX only)

Warning

The preexec_fn parameter is not safe to use in the presence of threads in your
application. The child process could deadlock before exec is called. If you
must use it, keep it trivial! Minimize the number of libraries you call into.

Note

If you need to modify the environment for the child use the env parameter
rather than doing it in a preexec_fn. The start_new_session parameter can take
the place of a previously common use of preexec_fn to call os.setsid() in the
child.

Changed in version 3.8: The preexec_fn parameter is no longer supported in
subinterpreters. The use of the parameter in a subinterpreter raises
`RuntimeError`. The new restriction may affect applications that are deployed
in mod_wsgi, uWSGI, and other embedded environments.

If close_fds is true, all file descriptors except `0`, `1` and `2` will be
closed before the child process is executed. Otherwise when close_fds is
false, file descriptors obey their inheritable flag as described in
Inheritance of File Descriptors.

On Windows, if close_fds is true then no handles will be inherited by the
child process unless explicitly passed in the `handle_list` element of
`STARTUPINFO.lpAttributeList`, or by standard handle redirection.

Changed in version 3.2: The default for close_fds was changed from `False` to
what is described above.

Changed in version 3.7: On Windows the default for close_fds was changed from
`False` to `True` when redirecting the standard handles. It’s now possible to
set close_fds to `True` when redirecting the standard handles.

pass_fds is an optional sequence of file descriptors to keep open between the
parent and child. Providing any pass_fds forces close_fds to be `True`. (POSIX
only)

Changed in version 3.2: The pass_fds parameter was added.

If cwd is not `None`, the function changes the working directory to cwd before
executing the child. cwd can be a string, bytes or path-like object. In
particular, the function looks for executable (or for the first item in args)
relative to cwd if the executable path is a relative path.

Changed in version 3.6: cwd parameter accepts a path-like object on POSIX.

Changed in version 3.7: cwd parameter accepts a path-like object on Windows.

Changed in version 3.8: cwd parameter accepts a bytes object on Windows.

If restore_signals is true (the default) all signals that Python has set to
SIG_IGN are restored to SIG_DFL in the child process before the exec.
Currently this includes the SIGPIPE, SIGXFZ and SIGXFSZ signals. (POSIX only)

Changed in version 3.2: restore_signals was added.

If start_new_session is true the setsid() system call will be made in the
child process prior to the execution of the subprocess. (POSIX only)

Changed in version 3.2: start_new_session was added.

If group is not `None`, the setregid() system call will be made in the child
process prior to the execution of the subprocess. If the provided value is a
string, it will be looked up via `grp.getgrnam()` and the value in `gr_gid`
will be used. If the value is an integer, it will be passed verbatim. (POSIX
only)

Availability: POSIX

New in version 3.9.

If extra_groups is not `None`, the setgroups() system call will be made in the
child process prior to the execution of the subprocess. Strings provided in
extra_groups will be looked up via `grp.getgrnam()` and the values in `gr_gid`
will be used. Integer values will be passed verbatim. (POSIX only)

Availability: POSIX

New in version 3.9.

If user is not `None`, the setreuid() system call will be made in the child
process prior to the execution of the subprocess. If the provided value is a
string, it will be looked up via `pwd.getpwnam()` and the value in `pw_uid`
will be used. If the value is an integer, it will be passed verbatim. (POSIX
only)

Availability: POSIX

New in version 3.9.

If umask is not negative, the umask() system call will be made in the child
process prior to the execution of the subprocess.

Availability: POSIX

New in version 3.9.

If env is not `None`, it must be a mapping that defines the environment
variables for the new process; these are used instead of the default behavior
of inheriting the current process’ environment.

Note

If specified, env must provide any variables required for the program to
execute. On Windows, in order to run a side-by-side assembly the specified env
must include a valid `SystemRoot`.

If encoding or errors are specified, or text is true, the file objects stdin,
stdout and stderr are opened in text mode with the specified encoding and
errors, as described above in Frequently Used Arguments. The
universal_newlines argument is equivalent to text and is provided for
backwards compatibility. By default, file objects are opened in binary mode.

New in version 3.6: encoding and errors were added.

New in version 3.7: text was added as a more readable alias for
universal_newlines.

If given, startupinfo will be a `STARTUPINFO` object, which is passed to the
underlying `CreateProcess` function. creationflags, if given, can be one or
more of the following flags:

  * `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE`
  * `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`
  * `ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`
  * `BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`
  * `HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS`
  * `IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS`
  * `NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`
  * `REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS`
  * `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`
  * `DETACHED_PROCESS`
  * `CREATE_DEFAULT_ERROR_MODE`
  * `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`

Popen objects are supported as context managers via the `with` statement: on
exit, standard file descriptors are closed, and the process is waited for.

    
    with Popen(["ifconfig"], stdout=PIPE) as proc:
        log.write(proc.stdout.read())
    
Popen and the other functions in this module that use it raise an auditing
event `subprocess.Popen` with arguments `executable`, `args`, `cwd`, and
`env`. The value for `args` may be a single string or a list of strings,
depending on platform.

Changed in version 3.2: Added context manager support.

Changed in version 3.6: Popen destructor now emits a `ResourceWarning` warning
if the child process is still running.

Changed in version 3.8: Popen can use `os.posix_spawn()` in some cases for
better performance. On Windows Subsystem for Linux and QEMU User Emulation,
Popen constructor using `os.posix_spawn()` no longer raise an exception on
errors like missing program, but the child process fails with a non-zero
`returncode`.

### Exceptions

Exceptions raised in the child process, before the new program has started to
execute, will be re-raised in the parent.

The most common exception raised is `OSError`. This occurs, for example, when
trying to execute a non-existent file. Applications should prepare for
`OSError` exceptions.

A `ValueError` will be raised if `Popen` is called with invalid arguments.

`check_call()` and `check_output()` will raise `CalledProcessError` if the
called process returns a non-zero return code.

All of the functions and methods that accept a timeout parameter, such as
`call()` and `Popen.communicate()` will raise `TimeoutExpired` if the timeout
expires before the process exits.

Exceptions defined in this module all inherit from `SubprocessError`.

New in version 3.3: The `SubprocessError` base class was added.

## Security Considerations

Unlike some other popen functions, this implementation will never implicitly
call a system shell. This means that all characters, including shell
metacharacters, can safely be passed to child processes. If the shell is
invoked explicitly, via `shell=True`, it is the application’s responsibility
to ensure that all whitespace and metacharacters are quoted appropriately to
avoid shell injection vulnerabilities.

When using `shell=True`, the `shlex.quote()` function can be used to properly
escape whitespace and shell metacharacters in strings that are going to be
used to construct shell commands.

## Popen Objects

Instances of the `Popen` class have the following methods:

`Popen.poll()`

    
Check if child process has terminated. Set and return `returncode` attribute.
Otherwise, returns `None`.

`Popen.wait(timeout=None)`

    
Wait for child process to terminate. Set and return `returncode` attribute.

If the process does not terminate after timeout seconds, raise a
`TimeoutExpired` exception. It is safe to catch this exception and retry the
wait.

Note

This will deadlock when using `stdout=PIPE` or `stderr=PIPE` and the child
process generates enough output to a pipe such that it blocks waiting for the
OS pipe buffer to accept more data. Use `Popen.communicate()` when using pipes
to avoid that.

Note

The function is implemented using a busy loop (non-blocking call and short
sleeps). Use the `asyncio` module for an asynchronous wait: see
`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`.

Changed in version 3.3: timeout was added.

`Popen.communicate(input=None, timeout=None)`

    
Interact with process: Send data to stdin. Read data from stdout and stderr,
until end-of-file is reached. Wait for process to terminate and set the
`returncode` attribute. The optional input argument should be data to be sent
to the child process, or `None`, if no data should be sent to the child. If
streams were opened in text mode, input must be a string. Otherwise, it must
be bytes.

`communicate()` returns a tuple `(stdout_data, stderr_data)`. The data will be
strings if streams were opened in text mode; otherwise, bytes.

Note that if you want to send data to the process’s stdin, you need to create
the Popen object with `stdin=PIPE`. Similarly, to get anything other than
`None` in the result tuple, you need to give `stdout=PIPE` and/or
`stderr=PIPE` too.

If the process does not terminate after timeout seconds, a `TimeoutExpired`
exception will be raised. Catching this exception and retrying communication
will not lose any output.

The child process is not killed if the timeout expires, so in order to cleanup
properly a well-behaved application should kill the child process and finish
communication:

    
    proc = subprocess.Popen(...)
    try:
        outs, errs = proc.communicate(timeout=15)
    except TimeoutExpired:
        proc.kill()
        outs, errs = proc.communicate()
    
Note

The data read is buffered in memory, so do not use this method if the data
size is large or unlimited.

Changed in version 3.3: timeout was added.

`Popen.send_signal(signal)`

    
Sends the signal signal to the child.

Do nothing if the process completed.

Note

On Windows, SIGTERM is an alias for `terminate()`. CTRL_C_EVENT and
CTRL_BREAK_EVENT can be sent to processes started with a creationflags
parameter which includes `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`.

`Popen.terminate()`

    
Stop the child. On POSIX OSs the method sends SIGTERM to the child. On Windows
the Win32 API function `TerminateProcess()` is called to stop the child.

`Popen.kill()`

    
Kills the child. On POSIX OSs the function sends SIGKILL to the child. On
Windows `kill()` is an alias for `terminate()`.

The following attributes are also available:

`Popen.args`

    
The args argument as it was passed to `Popen` – a sequence of program
arguments or else a single string.

New in version 3.3.

`Popen.stdin`

    
If the stdin argument was `PIPE`, this attribute is a writeable stream object
as returned by `open()`. If the encoding or errors arguments were specified or
the universal_newlines argument was `True`, the stream is a text stream,
otherwise it is a byte stream. If the stdin argument was not `PIPE`, this
attribute is `None`.

`Popen.stdout`

    
If the stdout argument was `PIPE`, this attribute is a readable stream object
as returned by `open()`. Reading from the stream provides output from the
child process. If the encoding or errors arguments were specified or the
universal_newlines argument was `True`, the stream is a text stream, otherwise
it is a byte stream. If the stdout argument was not `PIPE`, this attribute is
`None`.

`Popen.stderr`

    
If the stderr argument was `PIPE`, this attribute is a readable stream object
as returned by `open()`. Reading from the stream provides error output from
the child process. If the encoding or errors arguments were specified or the
universal_newlines argument was `True`, the stream is a text stream, otherwise
it is a byte stream. If the stderr argument was not `PIPE`, this attribute is
`None`.

Warning

Use `communicate()` rather than `.stdin.write`, `.stdout.read` or
`.stderr.read` to avoid deadlocks due to any of the other OS pipe buffers
filling up and blocking the child process.

`Popen.pid`

    
The process ID of the child process.

Note that if you set the shell argument to `True`, this is the process ID of
the spawned shell.

`Popen.returncode`

    
The child return code, set by `poll()` and `wait()` (and indirectly by
`communicate()`). A `None` value indicates that the process hasn’t terminated
yet.

A negative value `-N` indicates that the child was terminated by signal `N`
(POSIX only).

## Windows Popen Helpers

The `STARTUPINFO` class and following constants are only available on Windows.

`class subprocess.STARTUPINFO(*, dwFlags=0, hStdInput=None, hStdOutput=None,
hStdError=None, wShowWindow=0, lpAttributeList=None)`

    
Partial support of the Windows STARTUPINFO structure is used for `Popen`
creation. The following attributes can be set by passing them as keyword-only
arguments.

Changed in version 3.7: Keyword-only argument support was added.

`dwFlags`

    
A bit field that determines whether certain `STARTUPINFO` attributes are used
when the process creates a window.

    
    si = subprocess.STARTUPINFO()
    si.dwFlags = subprocess.STARTF_USESTDHANDLES | subprocess.STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW
    
`hStdInput`

    
If `dwFlags` specifies `STARTF_USESTDHANDLES`, this attribute is the standard
input handle for the process. If `STARTF_USESTDHANDLES` is not specified, the
default for standard input is the keyboard buffer.

`hStdOutput`

    
If `dwFlags` specifies `STARTF_USESTDHANDLES`, this attribute is the standard
output handle for the process. Otherwise, this attribute is ignored and the
default for standard output is the console window’s buffer.

`hStdError`

    
If `dwFlags` specifies `STARTF_USESTDHANDLES`, this attribute is the standard
error handle for the process. Otherwise, this attribute is ignored and the
default for standard error is the console window’s buffer.

`wShowWindow`

    
If `dwFlags` specifies `STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW`, this attribute can be any of
the values that can be specified in the `nCmdShow` parameter for the
ShowWindow function, except for `SW_SHOWDEFAULT`. Otherwise, this attribute is
ignored.

`SW_HIDE` is provided for this attribute. It is used when `Popen` is called
with `shell=True`.

`lpAttributeList`

    
A dictionary of additional attributes for process creation as given in
`STARTUPINFOEX`, see UpdateProcThreadAttribute.

Supported attributes:

handle_list

    
Sequence of handles that will be inherited. close_fds must be true if non-
empty.

The handles must be temporarily made inheritable by
`os.set_handle_inheritable()` when passed to the `Popen` constructor, else
`OSError` will be raised with Windows error `ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER` (87).

Warning

In a multithreaded process, use caution to avoid leaking handles that are
marked inheritable when combining this feature with concurrent calls to other
process creation functions that inherit all handles such as `os.system()`.
This also applies to standard handle redirection, which temporarily creates
inheritable handles.

New in version 3.7.

### Windows Constants

The `subprocess` module exposes the following constants.

`subprocess.STD_INPUT_HANDLE`

    
The standard input device. Initially, this is the console input buffer,
`CONIN$`.

`subprocess.STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE`

    
The standard output device. Initially, this is the active console screen
buffer, `CONOUT$`.

`subprocess.STD_ERROR_HANDLE`

    
The standard error device. Initially, this is the active console screen
buffer, `CONOUT$`.

`subprocess.SW_HIDE`

    
Hides the window. Another window will be activated.

`subprocess.STARTF_USESTDHANDLES`

    
Specifies that the `STARTUPINFO.hStdInput`, `STARTUPINFO.hStdOutput`, and
`STARTUPINFO.hStdError` attributes contain additional information.

`subprocess.STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW`

    
Specifies that the `STARTUPINFO.wShowWindow` attribute contains additional
information.

`subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE`

    
The new process has a new console, instead of inheriting its parent’s console
(the default).

`subprocess.CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`

    
A `Popen` `creationflags` parameter to specify that a new process group will
be created. This flag is necessary for using `os.kill()` on the subprocess.

This flag is ignored if `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE` is specified.

`subprocess.ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`

    
A `Popen` `creationflags` parameter to specify that a new process will have an
above average priority.

New in version 3.7.

`subprocess.BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`

    
A `Popen` `creationflags` parameter to specify that a new process will have a
below average priority.

New in version 3.7.

`subprocess.HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS`

    
A `Popen` `creationflags` parameter to specify that a new process will have a
high priority.

New in version 3.7.

`subprocess.IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS`

    
A `Popen` `creationflags` parameter to specify that a new process will have an
idle (lowest) priority.

New in version 3.7.

`subprocess.NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS`

    
A `Popen` `creationflags` parameter to specify that a new process will have an
normal priority. (default)

New in version 3.7.

`subprocess.REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS`

    
A `Popen` `creationflags` parameter to specify that a new process will have
realtime priority. You should almost never use REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS,
because this interrupts system threads that manage mouse input, keyboard
input, and background disk flushing. This class can be appropriate for
applications that “talk” directly to hardware or that perform brief tasks that
should have limited interruptions.

New in version 3.7.

`subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW`

    
A `Popen` `creationflags` parameter to specify that a new process will not
create a window.

New in version 3.7.

`subprocess.DETACHED_PROCESS`

    
A `Popen` `creationflags` parameter to specify that a new process will not
inherit its parent’s console. This value cannot be used with
CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE.

New in version 3.7.

`subprocess.CREATE_DEFAULT_ERROR_MODE`

    
A `Popen` `creationflags` parameter to specify that a new process does not
inherit the error mode of the calling process. Instead, the new process gets
the default error mode. This feature is particularly useful for multithreaded
shell applications that run with hard errors disabled.

New in version 3.7.

`subprocess.CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`

    
A `Popen` `creationflags` parameter to specify that a new process is not
associated with the job.

New in version 3.7.

## Older high-level API

Prior to Python 3.5, these three functions comprised the high level API to
subprocess. You can now use `run()` in many cases, but lots of existing code
calls these functions.

`subprocess.call(args, *, stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, shell=False,
cwd=None, timeout=None, **other_popen_kwargs)`

    
Run the command described by args. Wait for command to complete, then return
the `returncode` attribute.

Code needing to capture stdout or stderr should use `run()` instead:

    
    run(...).returncode
    
To suppress stdout or stderr, supply a value of `DEVNULL`.

The arguments shown above are merely some common ones. The full function
signature is the same as that of the `Popen` constructor - this function
passes all supplied arguments other than timeout directly through to that
interface.

Note

Do not use `stdout=PIPE` or `stderr=PIPE` with this function. The child
process will block if it generates enough output to a pipe to fill up the OS
pipe buffer as the pipes are not being read from.

Changed in version 3.3: timeout was added.

`subprocess.check_call(args, *, stdin=None, stdout=None, stderr=None,
shell=False, cwd=None, timeout=None, **other_popen_kwargs)`

    
Run command with arguments. Wait for command to complete. If the return code
was zero then return, otherwise raise `CalledProcessError`. The
`CalledProcessError` object will have the return code in the `returncode`
attribute.

Code needing to capture stdout or stderr should use `run()` instead:

    
    run(..., check=True)
    
To suppress stdout or stderr, supply a value of `DEVNULL`.

The arguments shown above are merely some common ones. The full function
signature is the same as that of the `Popen` constructor - this function
passes all supplied arguments other than timeout directly through to that
interface.

Note

Do not use `stdout=PIPE` or `stderr=PIPE` with this function. The child
process will block if it generates enough output to a pipe to fill up the OS
pipe buffer as the pipes are not being read from.

Changed in version 3.3: timeout was added.

`subprocess.check_output(args, *, stdin=None, stderr=None, shell=False,
cwd=None, encoding=None, errors=None, universal_newlines=None, timeout=None,
text=None, **other_popen_kwargs)`

    
Run command with arguments and return its output.

If the return code was non-zero it raises a `CalledProcessError`. The
`CalledProcessError` object will have the return code in the `returncode`
attribute and any output in the `output` attribute.

This is equivalent to:

    
    run(..., check=True, stdout=PIPE).stdout
    
The arguments shown above are merely some common ones. The full function
signature is largely the same as that of `run()` \- most arguments are passed
directly through to that interface. One API deviation from `run()` behavior
exists: passing `input=None` will behave the same as `input=b''` (or
`input=''`, depending on other arguments) rather than using the parent’s
standard input file handle.

By default, this function will return the data as encoded bytes. The actual
encoding of the output data may depend on the command being invoked, so the
decoding to text will often need to be handled at the application level.

This behaviour may be overridden by setting text, encoding, errors, or
universal_newlines to `True` as described in Frequently Used Arguments and
`run()`.

To also capture standard error in the result, use `stderr=subprocess.STDOUT`:

    
    >>> subprocess.check_output(
    ...     "ls non_existent_file; exit 0",
    ...     stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
    ...     shell=True)
    'ls: non_existent_file: No such file or directory\n'
    
New in version 3.1.

Changed in version 3.3: timeout was added.

Changed in version 3.4: Support for the input keyword argument was added.

Changed in version 3.6: encoding and errors were added. See `run()` for
details.

New in version 3.7: text was added as a more readable alias for
universal_newlines.

## Replacing Older Functions with the subprocess Module

In this section, “a becomes b” means that b can be used as a replacement for
a.

Note

All “a” functions in this section fail (more or less) silently if the executed
program cannot be found; the “b” replacements raise `OSError` instead.

In addition, the replacements using `check_output()` will fail with a
`CalledProcessError` if the requested operation produces a non-zero return
code. The output is still available as the `output` attribute of the raised
exception.

In the following examples, we assume that the relevant functions have already
been imported from the `subprocess` module.

### Replacing /bin/sh shell command substitution

    
    output=$(mycmd myarg)
    
becomes:

    
    output = check_output(["mycmd", "myarg"])
    
### Replacing shell pipeline

    
    output=$(dmesg | grep hda)
    
becomes:

    
    p1 = Popen(["dmesg"], stdout=PIPE)
    p2 = Popen(["grep", "hda"], stdin=p1.stdout, stdout=PIPE)
    p1.stdout.close()  # Allow p1 to receive a SIGPIPE if p2 exits.
    output = p2.communicate()[0]
    
The `p1.stdout.close()` call after starting the p2 is important in order for
p1 to receive a SIGPIPE if p2 exits before p1.

Alternatively, for trusted input, the shell’s own pipeline support may still
be used directly:

    
    output=$(dmesg | grep hda)
    
becomes:

    
    output=check_output("dmesg | grep hda", shell=True)
    
### Replacing `os.system()`

    
    sts = os.system("mycmd" + " myarg")
    # becomes
    sts = call("mycmd" + " myarg", shell=True)
    
Notes:

  * Calling the program through the shell is usually not required.

A more realistic example would look like this:

    
    try:
        retcode = call("mycmd" + " myarg", shell=True)
        if retcode < 0:
            print("Child was terminated by signal", -retcode, file=sys.stderr)
        else:
            print("Child returned", retcode, file=sys.stderr)
    except OSError as e:
        print("Execution failed:", e, file=sys.stderr)
    
### Replacing the `os.spawn` family

P_NOWAIT example:

    
    pid = os.spawnlp(os.P_NOWAIT, "/bin/mycmd", "mycmd", "myarg")
    ==>
    pid = Popen(["/bin/mycmd", "myarg"]).pid
    
P_WAIT example:

    
    retcode = os.spawnlp(os.P_WAIT, "/bin/mycmd", "mycmd", "myarg")
    ==>
    retcode = call(["/bin/mycmd", "myarg"])
    
Vector example:

    
    os.spawnvp(os.P_NOWAIT, path, args)
    ==>
    Popen([path] + args[1:])
    
Environment example:

    
    os.spawnlpe(os.P_NOWAIT, "/bin/mycmd", "mycmd", "myarg", env)
    ==>
    Popen(["/bin/mycmd", "myarg"], env={"PATH": "/usr/bin"})
    
### Replacing `os.popen()`, `os.popen2()`, `os.popen3()`

    
    (child_stdin, child_stdout) = os.popen2(cmd, mode, bufsize)
    ==>
    p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, bufsize=bufsize,
              stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, close_fds=True)
    (child_stdin, child_stdout) = (p.stdin, p.stdout)
    
    
    (child_stdin,
     child_stdout,
     child_stderr) = os.popen3(cmd, mode, bufsize)
    ==>
    p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, bufsize=bufsize,
              stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, close_fds=True)
    (child_stdin,
     child_stdout,
     child_stderr) = (p.stdin, p.stdout, p.stderr)
    
    
    (child_stdin, child_stdout_and_stderr) = os.popen4(cmd, mode, bufsize)
    ==>
    p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, bufsize=bufsize,
              stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT, close_fds=True)
    (child_stdin, child_stdout_and_stderr) = (p.stdin, p.stdout)
    
Return code handling translates as follows:

    
    pipe = os.popen(cmd, 'w')
    ...
    rc = pipe.close()
    if rc is not None and rc >> 8:
        print("There were some errors")
    ==>
    process = Popen(cmd, stdin=PIPE)
    ...
    process.stdin.close()
    if process.wait() != 0:
        print("There were some errors")
    
### Replacing functions from the `popen2` module

Note

If the cmd argument to popen2 functions is a string, the command is executed
through /bin/sh. If it is a list, the command is directly executed.

    
    (child_stdout, child_stdin) = popen2.popen2("somestring", bufsize, mode)
    ==>
    p = Popen("somestring", shell=True, bufsize=bufsize,
              stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, close_fds=True)
    (child_stdout, child_stdin) = (p.stdout, p.stdin)
    
    
    (child_stdout, child_stdin) = popen2.popen2(["mycmd", "myarg"], bufsize, mode)
    ==>
    p = Popen(["mycmd", "myarg"], bufsize=bufsize,
              stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, close_fds=True)
    (child_stdout, child_stdin) = (p.stdout, p.stdin)
    
`popen2.Popen3` and `popen2.Popen4` basically work as `subprocess.Popen`,
except that:

  * `Popen` raises an exception if the execution fails.
  * The capturestderr argument is replaced with the stderr argument.
  * `stdin=PIPE` and `stdout=PIPE` must be specified.
  * popen2 closes all file descriptors by default, but you have to specify `close_fds=True` with `Popen` to guarantee this behavior on all platforms or past Python versions.

## Legacy Shell Invocation Functions

This module also provides the following legacy functions from the 2.x
`commands` module. These operations implicitly invoke the system shell and
none of the guarantees described above regarding security and exception
handling consistency are valid for these functions.

`subprocess.getstatusoutput(cmd)`

    
Return `(exitcode, output)` of executing cmd in a shell.

Execute the string cmd in a shell with `Popen.check_output()` and return a
2-tuple `(exitcode, output)`. The locale encoding is used; see the notes on
Frequently Used Arguments for more details.

A trailing newline is stripped from the output. The exit code for the command
can be interpreted as the return code of subprocess. Example:

    
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('ls /bin/ls')
    (0, '/bin/ls')
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('cat /bin/junk')
    (1, 'cat: /bin/junk: No such file or directory')
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('/bin/junk')
    (127, 'sh: /bin/junk: not found')
    >>> subprocess.getstatusoutput('/bin/kill $$')
    (-15, '')
    
Availability: POSIX & Windows.

Changed in version 3.3.4: Windows support was added.

The function now returns (exitcode, output) instead of (status, output) as it
did in Python 3.3.3 and earlier. exitcode has the same value as `returncode`.

`subprocess.getoutput(cmd)`

    
Return output (stdout and stderr) of executing cmd in a shell.

Like `getstatusoutput()`, except the exit code is ignored and the return value
is a string containing the command’s output. Example:

    
    >>> subprocess.getoutput('ls /bin/ls')
    '/bin/ls'
    
Availability: POSIX & Windows.

Changed in version 3.3.4: Windows support added

## Notes

### Converting an argument sequence to a string on Windows

On Windows, an args sequence is converted to a string that can be parsed using
the following rules (which correspond to the rules used by the MS C runtime):

  1. Arguments are delimited by white space, which is either a space or a tab.
  2. A string surrounded by double quotation marks is interpreted as a single argument, regardless of white space contained within. A quoted string can be embedded in an argument.
  3. A double quotation mark preceded by a backslash is interpreted as a literal double quotation mark.
  4. Backslashes are interpreted literally, unless they immediately precede a double quotation mark.
  5. If backslashes immediately precede a double quotation mark, every pair of backslashes is interpreted as a literal backslash. If the number of backslashes is odd, the last backslash escapes the next double quotation mark as described in rule 3.
