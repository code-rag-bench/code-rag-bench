# stat — Interpreting stat() results

Source code: Lib/stat.py

The `stat` module defines constants and functions for interpreting the results
of `os.stat()`, `os.fstat()` and `os.lstat()` (if they exist). For complete
details about the `stat()`, `fstat()` and `lstat()` calls, consult the
documentation for your system.

Changed in version 3.4: The stat module is backed by a C implementation.

The `stat` module defines the following functions to test for specific file
types:

`stat.S_ISDIR(mode)`

    
Return non-zero if the mode is from a directory.

`stat.S_ISCHR(mode)`

    
Return non-zero if the mode is from a character special device file.

`stat.S_ISBLK(mode)`

    
Return non-zero if the mode is from a block special device file.

`stat.S_ISREG(mode)`

    
Return non-zero if the mode is from a regular file.

`stat.S_ISFIFO(mode)`

    
Return non-zero if the mode is from a FIFO (named pipe).

`stat.S_ISLNK(mode)`

    
Return non-zero if the mode is from a symbolic link.

`stat.S_ISSOCK(mode)`

    
Return non-zero if the mode is from a socket.

`stat.S_ISDOOR(mode)`

    
Return non-zero if the mode is from a door.

New in version 3.4.

`stat.S_ISPORT(mode)`

    
Return non-zero if the mode is from an event port.

New in version 3.4.

`stat.S_ISWHT(mode)`

    
Return non-zero if the mode is from a whiteout.

New in version 3.4.

Two additional functions are defined for more general manipulation of the
file’s mode:

`stat.S_IMODE(mode)`

    
Return the portion of the file’s mode that can be set by `os.chmod()`—that is,
the file’s permission bits, plus the sticky bit, set-group-id, and set-user-id
bits (on systems that support them).

`stat.S_IFMT(mode)`

    
Return the portion of the file’s mode that describes the file type (used by
the `S_IS*()` functions above).

Normally, you would use the `os.path.is*()` functions for testing the type of
a file; the functions here are useful when you are doing multiple tests of the
same file and wish to avoid the overhead of the `stat()` system call for each
test. These are also useful when checking for information about a file that
isn’t handled by `os.path`, like the tests for block and character devices.

Example:

    
    import os, sys
    from stat import *
    
    def walktree(top, callback):
        '''recursively descend the directory tree rooted at top,
           calling the callback function for each regular file'''
    
        for f in os.listdir(top):
            pathname = os.path.join(top, f)
            mode = os.stat(pathname).st_mode
            if S_ISDIR(mode):
                # It's a directory, recurse into it
                walktree(pathname, callback)
            elif S_ISREG(mode):
                # It's a file, call the callback function
                callback(pathname)
            else:
                # Unknown file type, print a message
                print('Skipping %s' % pathname)
    
    def visitfile(file):
        print('visiting', file)
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        walktree(sys.argv[1], visitfile)
    
An additional utility function is provided to convert a file’s mode in a human
readable string:

`stat.filemode(mode)`

    
Convert a file’s mode to a string of the form ‘-rwxrwxrwx’.

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.4: The function supports `S_IFDOOR`, `S_IFPORT` and
`S_IFWHT`.

All the variables below are simply symbolic indexes into the 10-tuple returned
by `os.stat()`, `os.fstat()` or `os.lstat()`.

`stat.ST_MODE`

    
Inode protection mode.

`stat.ST_INO`

    
Inode number.

`stat.ST_DEV`

    
Device inode resides on.

`stat.ST_NLINK`

    
Number of links to the inode.

`stat.ST_UID`

    
User id of the owner.

`stat.ST_GID`

    
Group id of the owner.

`stat.ST_SIZE`

    
Size in bytes of a plain file; amount of data waiting on some special files.

`stat.ST_ATIME`

    
Time of last access.

`stat.ST_MTIME`

    
Time of last modification.

`stat.ST_CTIME`

    
The “ctime” as reported by the operating system. On some systems (like Unix)
is the time of the last metadata change, and, on others (like Windows), is the
creation time (see platform documentation for details).

The interpretation of “file size” changes according to the file type. For
plain files this is the size of the file in bytes. For FIFOs and sockets under
most flavors of Unix (including Linux in particular), the “size” is the number
of bytes waiting to be read at the time of the call to `os.stat()`,
`os.fstat()`, or `os.lstat()`; this can sometimes be useful, especially for
polling one of these special files after a non-blocking open. The meaning of
the size field for other character and block devices varies more, depending on
the implementation of the underlying system call.

The variables below define the flags used in the `ST_MODE` field.

Use of the functions above is more portable than use of the first set of
flags:

`stat.S_IFSOCK`

    
Socket.

`stat.S_IFLNK`

    
Symbolic link.

`stat.S_IFREG`

    
Regular file.

`stat.S_IFBLK`

    
Block device.

`stat.S_IFDIR`

    
Directory.

`stat.S_IFCHR`

    
Character device.

`stat.S_IFIFO`

    
FIFO.

`stat.S_IFDOOR`

    
Door.

New in version 3.4.

`stat.S_IFPORT`

    
Event port.

New in version 3.4.

`stat.S_IFWHT`

    
Whiteout.

New in version 3.4.

Note

`S_IFDOOR`, `S_IFPORT` or `S_IFWHT` are defined as 0 when the platform does
not have support for the file types.

The following flags can also be used in the mode argument of `os.chmod()`:

`stat.S_ISUID`

    
Set UID bit.

`stat.S_ISGID`

    
Set-group-ID bit. This bit has several special uses. For a directory it
indicates that BSD semantics is to be used for that directory: files created
there inherit their group ID from the directory, not from the effective group
ID of the creating process, and directories created there will also get the
`S_ISGID` bit set. For a file that does not have the group execution bit
(`S_IXGRP`) set, the set-group-ID bit indicates mandatory file/record locking
(see also `S_ENFMT`).

`stat.S_ISVTX`

    
Sticky bit. When this bit is set on a directory it means that a file in that
directory can be renamed or deleted only by the owner of the file, by the
owner of the directory, or by a privileged process.

`stat.S_IRWXU`

    
Mask for file owner permissions.

`stat.S_IRUSR`

    
Owner has read permission.

`stat.S_IWUSR`

    
Owner has write permission.

`stat.S_IXUSR`

    
Owner has execute permission.

`stat.S_IRWXG`

    
Mask for group permissions.

`stat.S_IRGRP`

    
Group has read permission.

`stat.S_IWGRP`

    
Group has write permission.

`stat.S_IXGRP`

    
Group has execute permission.

`stat.S_IRWXO`

    
Mask for permissions for others (not in group).

`stat.S_IROTH`

    
Others have read permission.

`stat.S_IWOTH`

    
Others have write permission.

`stat.S_IXOTH`

    
Others have execute permission.

`stat.S_ENFMT`

    
System V file locking enforcement. This flag is shared with `S_ISGID`:
file/record locking is enforced on files that do not have the group execution
bit (`S_IXGRP`) set.

`stat.S_IREAD`

    
Unix V7 synonym for `S_IRUSR`.

`stat.S_IWRITE`

    
Unix V7 synonym for `S_IWUSR`.

`stat.S_IEXEC`

    
Unix V7 synonym for `S_IXUSR`.

The following flags can be used in the flags argument of `os.chflags()`:

`stat.UF_NODUMP`

    
Do not dump the file.

`stat.UF_IMMUTABLE`

    
The file may not be changed.

`stat.UF_APPEND`

    
The file may only be appended to.

`stat.UF_OPAQUE`

    
The directory is opaque when viewed through a union stack.

`stat.UF_NOUNLINK`

    
The file may not be renamed or deleted.

`stat.UF_COMPRESSED`

    
The file is stored compressed (Mac OS X 10.6+).

`stat.UF_HIDDEN`

    
The file should not be displayed in a GUI (Mac OS X 10.5+).

`stat.SF_ARCHIVED`

    
The file may be archived.

`stat.SF_IMMUTABLE`

    
The file may not be changed.

`stat.SF_APPEND`

    
The file may only be appended to.

`stat.SF_NOUNLINK`

    
The file may not be renamed or deleted.

`stat.SF_SNAPSHOT`

    
The file is a snapshot file.

See the *BSD or Mac OS systems man page chflags(2) for more information.
