# pty — Pseudo-terminal utilities

Source code: Lib/pty.py

The `pty` module defines operations for handling the pseudo-terminal concept:
starting another process and being able to write to and read from its
controlling terminal programmatically.

Because pseudo-terminal handling is highly platform dependent, there is code
to do it only for Linux. (The Linux code is supposed to work on other
platforms, but hasn’t been tested yet.)

The `pty` module defines the following functions:

`pty.fork()`

    
Fork. Connect the child’s controlling terminal to a pseudo-terminal. Return
value is `(pid, fd)`. Note that the child gets pid 0, and the fd is invalid.
The parent’s return value is the pid of the child, and fd is a file descriptor
connected to the child’s controlling terminal (and also to the child’s
standard input and output).

`pty.openpty()`

    
Open a new pseudo-terminal pair, using `os.openpty()` if possible, or
emulation code for generic Unix systems. Return a pair of file descriptors
`(master, slave)`, for the master and the slave end, respectively.

`pty.spawn(argv[, master_read[, stdin_read]])`

    
Spawn a process, and connect its controlling terminal with the current
process’s standard io. This is often used to baffle programs which insist on
reading from the controlling terminal. It is expected that the process spawned
behind the pty will eventually terminate, and when it does spawn will return.

The functions master_read and stdin_read are passed a file descriptor which
they should read from, and they should always return a byte string. In order
to force spawn to return before the child process exits an `OSError` should be
thrown.

The default implementation for both functions will read and return up to 1024
bytes each time the function is called. The master_read callback is passed the
pseudoterminal’s master file descriptor to read output from the child process,
and stdin_read is passed file descriptor 0, to read from the parent process’s
standard input.

Returning an empty byte string from either callback is interpreted as an end-
of-file (EOF) condition, and that callback will not be called after that. If
stdin_read signals EOF the controlling terminal can no longer communicate with
the parent process OR the child process. Unless the child process will quit
without any input, spawn will then loop forever. If master_read signals EOF
the same behavior results (on linux at least).

If both callbacks signal EOF then spawn will probably never return, unless
select throws an error on your platform when passed three empty lists. This is
a bug, documented in issue 26228.

Return the exit status value from `os.waitpid()` on the child process.

`waitstatus_to_exitcode()` can be used to convert the exit status into an exit
code.

Raises an auditing event `pty.spawn` with argument `argv`.

Changed in version 3.4: `spawn()` now returns the status value from
`os.waitpid()` on the child process.

## Example

The following program acts like the Unix command script(1), using a pseudo-
terminal to record all input and output of a terminal session in a
“typescript”.

    
    import argparse
    import os
    import pty
    import sys
    import time
    
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('-a', dest='append', action='store_true')
    parser.add_argument('-p', dest='use_python', action='store_true')
    parser.add_argument('filename', nargs='?', default='typescript')
    options = parser.parse_args()
    
    shell = sys.executable if options.use_python else os.environ.get('SHELL', 'sh')
    filename = options.filename
    mode = 'ab' if options.append else 'wb'
    
    with open(filename, mode) as script:
        def read(fd):
            data = os.read(fd, 1024)
            script.write(data)
            return data
    
        print('Script started, file is', filename)
        script.write(('Script started on %s\n' % time.asctime()).encode())
    
        pty.spawn(shell, read)
    
        script.write(('Script done on %s\n' % time.asctime()).encode())
        print('Script done, file is', filename)
