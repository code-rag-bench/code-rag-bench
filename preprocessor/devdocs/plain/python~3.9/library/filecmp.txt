# filecmp — File and Directory Comparisons

Source code: Lib/filecmp.py

The `filecmp` module defines functions to compare files and directories, with
various optional time/correctness trade-offs. For comparing files, see also
the `difflib` module.

The `filecmp` module defines the following functions:

`filecmp.cmp(f1, f2, shallow=True)`

    
Compare the files named f1 and f2, returning `True` if they seem equal,
`False` otherwise.

If shallow is true, files with identical `os.stat()` signatures are taken to
be equal. Otherwise, the contents of the files are compared.

Note that no external programs are called from this function, giving it
portability and efficiency.

This function uses a cache for past comparisons and the results, with cache
entries invalidated if the `os.stat()` information for the file changes. The
entire cache may be cleared using `clear_cache()`.

`filecmp.cmpfiles(dir1, dir2, common, shallow=True)`

    
Compare the files in the two directories dir1 and dir2 whose names are given
by common.

Returns three lists of file names: match, mismatch, errors. match contains the
list of files that match, mismatch contains the names of those that don’t, and
errors lists the names of files which could not be compared. Files are listed
in errors if they don’t exist in one of the directories, the user lacks
permission to read them or if the comparison could not be done for some other
reason.

The shallow parameter has the same meaning and default value as for
`filecmp.cmp()`.

For example, `cmpfiles('a', 'b', ['c', 'd/e'])` will compare `a/c` with `b/c`
and `a/d/e` with `b/d/e`. `'c'` and `'d/e'` will each be in one of the three
returned lists.

`filecmp.clear_cache()`

    
Clear the filecmp cache. This may be useful if a file is compared so quickly
after it is modified that it is within the mtime resolution of the underlying
filesystem.

New in version 3.4.

## The dircmp class

`class filecmp.dircmp(a, b, ignore=None, hide=None)`

    
Construct a new directory comparison object, to compare the directories a and
b. ignore is a list of names to ignore, and defaults to
`filecmp.DEFAULT_IGNORES`. hide is a list of names to hide, and defaults to
`[os.curdir, os.pardir]`.

The `dircmp` class compares files by doing shallow comparisons as described
for `filecmp.cmp()`.

The `dircmp` class provides the following methods:

`report()`

    
Print (to `sys.stdout`) a comparison between a and b.

`report_partial_closure()`

    
Print a comparison between a and b and common immediate subdirectories.

`report_full_closure()`

    
Print a comparison between a and b and common subdirectories (recursively).

The `dircmp` class offers a number of interesting attributes that may be used
to get various bits of information about the directory trees being compared.

Note that via `__getattr__()` hooks, all attributes are computed lazily, so
there is no speed penalty if only those attributes which are lightweight to
compute are used.

`left`

    
The directory a.

`right`

    
The directory b.

`left_list`

    
Files and subdirectories in a, filtered by hide and ignore.

`right_list`

    
Files and subdirectories in b, filtered by hide and ignore.

`common`

    
Files and subdirectories in both a and b.

`left_only`

    
Files and subdirectories only in a.

`right_only`

    
Files and subdirectories only in b.

`common_dirs`

    
Subdirectories in both a and b.

`common_files`

    
Files in both a and b.

`common_funny`

    
Names in both a and b, such that the type differs between the directories, or
names for which `os.stat()` reports an error.

`same_files`

    
Files which are identical in both a and b, using the class’s file comparison
operator.

`diff_files`

    
Files which are in both a and b, whose contents differ according to the
class’s file comparison operator.

`funny_files`

    
Files which are in both a and b, but could not be compared.

`subdirs`

    
A dictionary mapping names in `common_dirs` to `dircmp` objects.

`filecmp.DEFAULT_IGNORES`

    
New in version 3.4.

List of directories ignored by `dircmp` by default.

Here is a simplified example of using the `subdirs` attribute to search
recursively through two directories to show common different files:

    
    >>> from filecmp import dircmp
    >>> def print_diff_files(dcmp):
    ...     for name in dcmp.diff_files:
    ...         print("diff_file %s found in %s and %s" % (name, dcmp.left,
    ...               dcmp.right))
    ...     for sub_dcmp in dcmp.subdirs.values():
    ...         print_diff_files(sub_dcmp)
    ...
    >>> dcmp = dircmp('dir1', 'dir2') 
    >>> print_diff_files(dcmp)
