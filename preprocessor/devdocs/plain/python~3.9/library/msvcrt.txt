# msvcrt — Useful routines from the MS VC++ runtime

These functions provide access to some useful capabilities on Windows
platforms. Some higher-level modules use these functions to build the Windows
implementations of their services. For example, the `getpass` module uses this
in the implementation of the `getpass()` function.

Further documentation on these functions can be found in the Platform API
documentation.

The module implements both the normal and wide char variants of the console
I/O api. The normal API deals only with ASCII characters and is of limited use
for internationalized applications. The wide char API should be used where
ever possible.

Changed in version 3.3: Operations in this module now raise `OSError` where
`IOError` was raised.

## File Operations

`msvcrt.locking(fd, mode, nbytes)`

    
Lock part of a file based on file descriptor fd from the C runtime. Raises
`OSError` on failure. The locked region of the file extends from the current
file position for nbytes bytes, and may continue beyond the end of the file.
mode must be one of the `LK_*` constants listed below. Multiple regions in a
file may be locked at the same time, but may not overlap. Adjacent regions are
not merged; they must be unlocked individually.

Raises an auditing event `msvcrt.locking` with arguments `fd`, `mode`,
`nbytes`.

`msvcrt.LK_LOCK`

`msvcrt.LK_RLCK`

    
Locks the specified bytes. If the bytes cannot be locked, the program
immediately tries again after 1 second. If, after 10 attempts, the bytes
cannot be locked, `OSError` is raised.

`msvcrt.LK_NBLCK`

`msvcrt.LK_NBRLCK`

    
Locks the specified bytes. If the bytes cannot be locked, `OSError` is raised.

`msvcrt.LK_UNLCK`

    
Unlocks the specified bytes, which must have been previously locked.

`msvcrt.setmode(fd, flags)`

    
Set the line-end translation mode for the file descriptor fd. To set it to
text mode, flags should be `os.O_TEXT`; for binary, it should be
`os.O_BINARY`.

`msvcrt.open_osfhandle(handle, flags)`

    
Create a C runtime file descriptor from the file handle handle. The flags
parameter should be a bitwise OR of `os.O_APPEND`, `os.O_RDONLY`, and
`os.O_TEXT`. The returned file descriptor may be used as a parameter to
`os.fdopen()` to create a file object.

Raises an auditing event `msvcrt.open_osfhandle` with arguments `handle`,
`flags`.

`msvcrt.get_osfhandle(fd)`

    
Return the file handle for the file descriptor fd. Raises `OSError` if fd is
not recognized.

Raises an auditing event `msvcrt.get_osfhandle` with argument `fd`.

## Console I/O

`msvcrt.kbhit()`

    
Return `True` if a keypress is waiting to be read.

`msvcrt.getch()`

    
Read a keypress and return the resulting character as a byte string. Nothing
is echoed to the console. This call will block if a keypress is not already
available, but will not wait for `Enter` to be pressed. If the pressed key was
a special function key, this will return `'\000'` or `'\xe0'`; the next call
will return the keycode. The `Control-C` keypress cannot be read with this
function.

`msvcrt.getwch()`

    
Wide char variant of `getch()`, returning a Unicode value.

`msvcrt.getche()`

    
Similar to `getch()`, but the keypress will be echoed if it represents a
printable character.

`msvcrt.getwche()`

    
Wide char variant of `getche()`, returning a Unicode value.

`msvcrt.putch(char)`

    
Print the byte string char to the console without buffering.

`msvcrt.putwch(unicode_char)`

    
Wide char variant of `putch()`, accepting a Unicode value.

`msvcrt.ungetch(char)`

    
Cause the byte string char to be “pushed back” into the console buffer; it
will be the next character read by `getch()` or `getche()`.

`msvcrt.ungetwch(unicode_char)`

    
Wide char variant of `ungetch()`, accepting a Unicode value.

## Other Functions

`msvcrt.heapmin()`

    
Force the `malloc()` heap to clean itself up and return unused blocks to the
operating system. On failure, this raises `OSError`.
