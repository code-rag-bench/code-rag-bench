# telnetlib — Telnet client

Source code: Lib/telnetlib.py

The `telnetlib` module provides a `Telnet` class that implements the Telnet
protocol. See RFC 854 for details about the protocol. In addition, it provides
symbolic constants for the protocol characters (see below), and for the telnet
options. The symbolic names of the telnet options follow the definitions in
`arpa/telnet.h`, with the leading `TELOPT_` removed. For symbolic names of
options which are traditionally not included in `arpa/telnet.h`, see the
module source itself.

The symbolic constants for the telnet commands are: IAC, DONT, DO, WONT, WILL,
SE (Subnegotiation End), NOP (No Operation), DM (Data Mark), BRK (Break), IP
(Interrupt process), AO (Abort output), AYT (Are You There), EC (Erase
Character), EL (Erase Line), GA (Go Ahead), SB (Subnegotiation Begin).

`class telnetlib.Telnet(host=None, port=0[, timeout])`

    
`Telnet` represents a connection to a Telnet server. The instance is initially
not connected by default; the `open()` method must be used to establish a
connection. Alternatively, the host name and optional port number can be
passed to the constructor too, in which case the connection to the server will
be established before the constructor returns. The optional timeout parameter
specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the connection
attempt (if not specified, the global default timeout setting will be used).

Do not reopen an already connected instance.

This class has many `read_*()` methods. Note that some of them raise
`EOFError` when the end of the connection is read, because they can return an
empty string for other reasons. See the individual descriptions below.

A `Telnet` object is a context manager and can be used in a `with` statement.
When the `with` block ends, the `close()` method is called:

    
    >>> from telnetlib import Telnet
    >>> with Telnet('localhost', 23) as tn:
    ...     tn.interact()
    ...
    
Changed in version 3.6: Context manager support added

Definition of the Telnet protocol.

## Telnet Objects

`Telnet` instances have the following methods:

`Telnet.read_until(expected, timeout=None)`

    
Read until a given byte string, expected, is encountered or until timeout
seconds have passed.

When no match is found, return whatever is available instead, possibly empty
bytes. Raise `EOFError` if the connection is closed and no cooked data is
available.

`Telnet.read_all()`

    
Read all data until EOF as bytes; block until connection closed.

`Telnet.read_some()`

    
Read at least one byte of cooked data unless EOF is hit. Return `b''` if EOF
is hit. Block if no data is immediately available.

`Telnet.read_very_eager()`

    
Read everything that can be without blocking in I/O (eager).

Raise `EOFError` if connection closed and no cooked data available. Return
`b''` if no cooked data available otherwise. Do not block unless in the midst
of an IAC sequence.

`Telnet.read_eager()`

    
Read readily available data.

Raise `EOFError` if connection closed and no cooked data available. Return
`b''` if no cooked data available otherwise. Do not block unless in the midst
of an IAC sequence.

`Telnet.read_lazy()`

    
Process and return data already in the queues (lazy).

Raise `EOFError` if connection closed and no data available. Return `b''` if
no cooked data available otherwise. Do not block unless in the midst of an IAC
sequence.

`Telnet.read_very_lazy()`

    
Return any data available in the cooked queue (very lazy).

Raise `EOFError` if connection closed and no data available. Return `b''` if
no cooked data available otherwise. This method never blocks.

`Telnet.read_sb_data()`

    
Return the data collected between a SB/SE pair (suboption begin/end). The
callback should access these data when it was invoked with a `SE` command.
This method never blocks.

`Telnet.open(host, port=0[, timeout])`

    
Connect to a host. The optional second argument is the port number, which
defaults to the standard Telnet port (23). The optional timeout parameter
specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the connection
attempt (if not specified, the global default timeout setting will be used).

Do not try to reopen an already connected instance.

Raises an auditing event `telnetlib.Telnet.open` with arguments `self`,
`host`, `port`.

`Telnet.msg(msg, *args)`

    
Print a debug message when the debug level is `>` 0\. If extra arguments are
present, they are substituted in the message using the standard string
formatting operator.

`Telnet.set_debuglevel(debuglevel)`

    
Set the debug level. The higher the value of debuglevel, the more debug output
you get (on `sys.stdout`).

`Telnet.close()`

    
Close the connection.

`Telnet.get_socket()`

    
Return the socket object used internally.

`Telnet.fileno()`

    
Return the file descriptor of the socket object used internally.

`Telnet.write(buffer)`

    
Write a byte string to the socket, doubling any IAC characters. This can block
if the connection is blocked. May raise `OSError` if the connection is closed.

Raises an auditing event `telnetlib.Telnet.write` with arguments `self`,
`buffer`.

Changed in version 3.3: This method used to raise `socket.error`, which is now
an alias of `OSError`.

`Telnet.interact()`

    
Interaction function, emulates a very dumb Telnet client.

`Telnet.mt_interact()`

    
Multithreaded version of `interact()`.

`Telnet.expect(list, timeout=None)`

    
Read until one from a list of a regular expressions matches.

The first argument is a list of regular expressions, either compiled (regex
objects) or uncompiled (byte strings). The optional second argument is a
timeout, in seconds; the default is to block indefinitely.

Return a tuple of three items: the index in the list of the first regular
expression that matches; the match object returned; and the bytes read up till
and including the match.

If end of file is found and no bytes were read, raise `EOFError`. Otherwise,
when nothing matches, return `(-1, None, data)` where data is the bytes
received so far (may be empty bytes if a timeout happened).

If a regular expression ends with a greedy match (such as `.*`) or if more
than one expression can match the same input, the results are non-
deterministic, and may depend on the I/O timing.

`Telnet.set_option_negotiation_callback(callback)`

    
Each time a telnet option is read on the input flow, this callback (if set) is
called with the following parameters: callback(telnet socket, command
(DO/DONT/WILL/WONT), option). No other action is done afterwards by telnetlib.

## Telnet Example

A simple example illustrating typical use:

    
    import getpass
    import telnetlib
    
    HOST = "localhost"
    user = input("Enter your remote account: ")
    password = getpass.getpass()
    
    tn = telnetlib.Telnet(HOST)
    
    tn.read_until(b"login: ")
    tn.write(user.encode('ascii') + b"\n")
    if password:
        tn.read_until(b"Password: ")
        tn.write(password.encode('ascii') + b"\n")
    
    tn.write(b"ls\n")
    tn.write(b"exit\n")
    
    print(tn.read_all().decode('ascii'))
