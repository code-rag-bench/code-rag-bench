# termios — POSIX style tty control

This module provides an interface to the POSIX calls for tty I/O control. For
a complete description of these calls, see termios(3) Unix manual page. It is
only available for those Unix versions that support POSIX termios style tty
I/O control configured during installation.

All functions in this module take a file descriptor fd as their first
argument. This can be an integer file descriptor, such as returned by
`sys.stdin.fileno()`, or a file object, such as `sys.stdin` itself.

This module also defines all the constants needed to work with the functions
provided here; these have the same name as their counterparts in C. Please
refer to your system documentation for more information on using these
terminal control interfaces.

The module defines the following functions:

`termios.tcgetattr(fd)`

    
Return a list containing the tty attributes for file descriptor fd, as
follows: `[iflag, oflag, cflag, lflag, ispeed, ospeed, cc]` where cc is a list
of the tty special characters (each a string of length 1, except the items
with indices `VMIN` and `VTIME`, which are integers when these fields are
defined). The interpretation of the flags and the speeds as well as the
indexing in the cc array must be done using the symbolic constants defined in
the `termios` module.

`termios.tcsetattr(fd, when, attributes)`

    
Set the tty attributes for file descriptor fd from the attributes, which is a
list like the one returned by `tcgetattr()`. The when argument determines when
the attributes are changed: `TCSANOW` to change immediately, `TCSADRAIN` to
change after transmitting all queued output, or `TCSAFLUSH` to change after
transmitting all queued output and discarding all queued input.

`termios.tcsendbreak(fd, duration)`

    
Send a break on file descriptor fd. A zero duration sends a break for 0.25–0.5
seconds; a nonzero duration has a system dependent meaning.

`termios.tcdrain(fd)`

    
Wait until all output written to file descriptor fd has been transmitted.

`termios.tcflush(fd, queue)`

    
Discard queued data on file descriptor fd. The queue selector specifies which
queue: `TCIFLUSH` for the input queue, `TCOFLUSH` for the output queue, or
`TCIOFLUSH` for both queues.

`termios.tcflow(fd, action)`

    
Suspend or resume input or output on file descriptor fd. The action argument
can be `TCOOFF` to suspend output, `TCOON` to restart output, `TCIOFF` to
suspend input, or `TCION` to restart input.

## Example

Here’s a function that prompts for a password with echoing turned off. Note
the technique using a separate `tcgetattr()` call and a `try` … `finally`
statement to ensure that the old tty attributes are restored exactly no matter
what happens:

    
    def getpass(prompt="Password: "):
        import termios, sys
        fd = sys.stdin.fileno()
        old = termios.tcgetattr(fd)
        new = termios.tcgetattr(fd)
        new[3] = new[3] & ~termios.ECHO          # lflags
        try:
            termios.tcsetattr(fd, termios.TCSADRAIN, new)
            passwd = input(prompt)
        finally:
            termios.tcsetattr(fd, termios.TCSADRAIN, old)
        return passwd
