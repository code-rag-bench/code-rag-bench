# fnmatch — Unix filename pattern matching

Source code: Lib/fnmatch.py

This module provides support for Unix shell-style wildcards, which are not the
same as regular expressions (which are documented in the `re` module). The
special characters used in shell-style wildcards are:

Pattern | Meaning  
---|---  
`*` | matches everything  
`?` | matches any single character  
`[seq]` | matches any character in seq  
`[!seq]` | matches any character not in seq  
For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets. For example,
`'[?]'` matches the character `'?'`.

Note that the filename separator (`'/'` on Unix) is not special to this
module. See module `glob` for pathname expansion (`glob` uses `filter()` to
match pathname segments). Similarly, filenames starting with a period are not
special for this module, and are matched by the `*` and `?` patterns.

`fnmatch.fnmatch(filename, pattern)`

    
Test whether the filename string matches the pattern string, returning `True`
or `False`. Both parameters are case-normalized using `os.path.normcase()`.
`fnmatchcase()` can be used to perform a case-sensitive comparison, regardless
of whether that’s standard for the operating system.

This example will print all file names in the current directory with the
extension `.txt`:

    
    import fnmatch
    import os
    
    for file in os.listdir('.'):
        if fnmatch.fnmatch(file, '*.txt'):
            print(file)
    
`fnmatch.fnmatchcase(filename, pattern)`

    
Test whether filename matches pattern, returning `True` or `False`; the
comparison is case-sensitive and does not apply `os.path.normcase()`.

`fnmatch.filter(names, pattern)`

    
Construct a list from those elements of the iterable names that match pattern.
It is the same as `[n for n in names if fnmatch(n, pattern)]`, but implemented
more efficiently.

`fnmatch.translate(pattern)`

    
Return the shell-style pattern converted to a regular expression for using
with `re.match()`.

Example:

    
    >>> import fnmatch, re
    >>>
    >>> regex = fnmatch.translate('*.txt')
    >>> regex
    '(?s:.*\\.txt)\\Z'
    >>> reobj = re.compile(regex)
    >>> reobj.match('foobar.txt')
    <re.Match object; span=(0, 10), match='foobar.txt'>
