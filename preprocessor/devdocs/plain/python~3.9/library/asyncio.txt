# asyncio — Asynchronous I/O

Hello World!

    
    import asyncio
    
    async def main():
        print('Hello ...')
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        print('... World!')
    
    # Python 3.7+
    asyncio.run(main())
    
asyncio is a library to write concurrent code using the async/await syntax.

asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks
that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection
libraries, distributed task queues, etc.

asyncio is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network
code.

asyncio provides a set of high-level APIs to:

  * run Python coroutines concurrently and have full control over their execution;
  * perform network IO and IPC;
  * control subprocesses;
  * distribute tasks via queues;
  * synchronize concurrent code;

Additionally, there are low-level APIs for library and framework developers
to:

  * create and manage event loops, which provide asynchronous APIs for `networking`, running `subprocesses`, handling `OS signals`, etc;
  * implement efficient protocols using transports;
  * bridge callback-based libraries and code with async/await syntax.
