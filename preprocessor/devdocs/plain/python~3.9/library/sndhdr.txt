# sndhdr — Determine type of sound file

Source code: Lib/sndhdr.py

The `sndhdr` provides utility functions which attempt to determine the type of
sound data which is in a file. When these functions are able to determine what
type of sound data is stored in a file, they return a `namedtuple()`,
containing five attributes: (`filetype`, `framerate`, `nchannels`, `nframes`,
`sampwidth`). The value for type indicates the data type and will be one of
the strings `'aifc'`, `'aiff'`, `'au'`, `'hcom'`, `'sndr'`, `'sndt'`, `'voc'`,
`'wav'`, `'8svx'`, `'sb'`, `'ub'`, or `'ul'`. The sampling_rate will be either
the actual value or `0` if unknown or difficult to decode. Similarly, channels
will be either the number of channels or `0` if it cannot be determined or if
the value is difficult to decode. The value for frames will be either the
number of frames or `-1`. The last item in the tuple, bits_per_sample, will
either be the sample size in bits or `'A'` for A-LAW or `'U'` for u-LAW.

`sndhdr.what(filename)`

    
Determines the type of sound data stored in the file filename using
`whathdr()`. If it succeeds, returns a namedtuple as described above,
otherwise `None` is returned.

Changed in version 3.5: Result changed from a tuple to a namedtuple.

`sndhdr.whathdr(filename)`

    
Determines the type of sound data stored in a file based on the file header.
The name of the file is given by filename. This function returns a namedtuple
as described above on success, or `None`.

Changed in version 3.5: Result changed from a tuple to a namedtuple.
