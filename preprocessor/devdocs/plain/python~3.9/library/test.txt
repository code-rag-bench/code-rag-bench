# test — Regression tests package for Python

Note

The `test` package is meant for internal use by Python only. It is documented
for the benefit of the core developers of Python. Any use of this package
outside of Python’s standard library is discouraged as code mentioned here can
change or be removed without notice between releases of Python.

The `test` package contains all regression tests for Python as well as the
modules `test.support` and `test.regrtest`. `test.support` is used to enhance
your tests while `test.regrtest` drives the testing suite.

Each module in the `test` package whose name starts with `test_` is a testing
suite for a specific module or feature. All new tests should be written using
the `unittest` or `doctest` module. Some older tests are written using a
“traditional” testing style that compares output printed to `sys.stdout`; this
style of test is considered deprecated.

## Writing Unit Tests for the test package

It is preferred that tests that use the `unittest` module follow a few
guidelines. One is to name the test module by starting it with `test_` and end
it with the name of the module being tested. The test methods in the test
module should start with `test_` and end with a description of what the method
is testing. This is needed so that the methods are recognized by the test
driver as test methods. Also, no documentation string for the method should be
included. A comment (such as `# Tests function returns only True or False`)
should be used to provide documentation for test methods. This is done because
documentation strings get printed out if they exist and thus what test is
being run is not stated.

A basic boilerplate is often used:

    
    import unittest
    from test import support
    
    class MyTestCase1(unittest.TestCase):
    
        # Only use setUp() and tearDown() if necessary
    
        def setUp(self):
            ... code to execute in preparation for tests ...
    
        def tearDown(self):
            ... code to execute to clean up after tests ...
    
        def test_feature_one(self):
            # Test feature one.
            ... testing code ...
    
        def test_feature_two(self):
            # Test feature two.
            ... testing code ...
    
        ... more test methods ...
    
    class MyTestCase2(unittest.TestCase):
        ... same structure as MyTestCase1 ...
    
    ... more test classes ...
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    
This code pattern allows the testing suite to be run by `test.regrtest`, on
its own as a script that supports the `unittest` CLI, or via the `python -m
unittest` CLI.

The goal for regression testing is to try to break code. This leads to a few
guidelines to be followed:

  * The testing suite should exercise all classes, functions, and constants. This includes not just the external API that is to be presented to the outside world but also “private” code.
  * Whitebox testing (examining the code being tested when the tests are being written) is preferred. Blackbox testing (testing only the published user interface) is not complete enough to make sure all boundary and edge cases are tested.
  * Make sure all possible values are tested including invalid ones. This makes sure that not only all valid values are acceptable but also that improper values are handled correctly.
  * Exhaust as many code paths as possible. Test where branching occurs and thus tailor input to make sure as many different paths through the code are taken.
  * Add an explicit test for any bugs discovered for the tested code. This will make sure that the error does not crop up again if the code is changed in the future.
  * Make sure to clean up after your tests (such as close and remove all temporary files).
  * If a test is dependent on a specific condition of the operating system then verify the condition already exists before attempting the test.
  * Import as few modules as possible and do it as soon as possible. This minimizes external dependencies of tests and also minimizes possible anomalous behavior from side-effects of importing a module.
  * Try to maximize code reuse. On occasion, tests will vary by something as small as what type of input is used. Minimize code duplication by subclassing a basic test class with a class that specifies the input:
        class TestFuncAcceptsSequencesMixin:
    
        func = mySuperWhammyFunction
    
        def test_func(self):
            self.func(self.arg)
    
    class AcceptLists(TestFuncAcceptsSequencesMixin, unittest.TestCase):
        arg = [1, 2, 3]
    
    class AcceptStrings(TestFuncAcceptsSequencesMixin, unittest.TestCase):
        arg = 'abc'
    
    class AcceptTuples(TestFuncAcceptsSequencesMixin, unittest.TestCase):
        arg = (1, 2, 3)
    
When using this pattern, remember that all classes that inherit from
`unittest.TestCase` are run as tests. The `Mixin` class in the example above
does not have any data and so can’t be run by itself, thus it does not inherit
from `unittest.TestCase`.

## Running tests using the command-line interface

The `test` package can be run as a script to drive Python’s regression test
suite, thanks to the `-m` option: python -m test. Under the hood, it uses
`test.regrtest`; the call python -m test.regrtest used in previous Python
versions still works. Running the script by itself automatically starts
running all regression tests in the `test` package. It does this by finding
all modules in the package whose name starts with `test_`, importing them, and
executing the function `test_main()` if present or loading the tests via
unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule if `test_main` does not exist. The
names of tests to execute may also be passed to the script. Specifying a
single regression test (python -m test test_spam) will minimize output and
only print whether the test passed or failed.

Running `test` directly allows what resources are available for tests to use
to be set. You do this by using the `-u` command-line option. Specifying `all`
as the value for the `-u` option enables all possible resources: python -m
test -uall. If all but one resource is desired (a more common case), a comma-
separated list of resources that are not desired may be listed after `all`.
The command python -m test -uall,-audio,-largefile will run `test` with all
resources except the `audio` and `largefile` resources. For a list of all
resources and more command-line options, run python -m test -h.

Some other ways to execute the regression tests depend on what platform the
tests are being executed on. On Unix, you can run make test at the top-level
directory where Python was built. On Windows, executing rt.bat from your
`PCbuild` directory will run all regression tests.

# test.support — Utilities for the Python test suite

The `test.support` module provides support for Python’s regression test suite.

Note

`test.support` is not a public module. It is documented here to help Python
developers write tests. The API of this module is subject to change without
backwards compatibility concerns between releases.

This module defines the following exceptions:

`exception test.support.TestFailed`

    
Exception to be raised when a test fails. This is deprecated in favor of
`unittest`-based tests and `unittest.TestCase`’s assertion methods.

`exception test.support.ResourceDenied`

    
Subclass of `unittest.SkipTest`. Raised when a resource (such as a network
connection) is not available. Raised by the `requires()` function.

The `test.support` module defines the following constants:

`test.support.verbose`

    
`True` when verbose output is enabled. Should be checked when more detailed
information is desired about a running test. verbose is set by
`test.regrtest`.

`test.support.is_jython`

    
`True` if the running interpreter is Jython.

`test.support.is_android`

    
`True` if the system is Android.

`test.support.unix_shell`

    
Path for shell if not on Windows; otherwise `None`.

`test.support.FS_NONASCII`

    
A non-ASCII character encodable by `os.fsencode()`.

`test.support.TESTFN`

    
Set to a name that is safe to use as the name of a temporary file. Any
temporary file that is created should be closed and unlinked (removed).

`test.support.TESTFN_UNICODE`

    
Set to a non-ASCII name for a temporary file.

`test.support.TESTFN_ENCODING`

    
Set to `sys.getfilesystemencoding()`.

`test.support.TESTFN_UNENCODABLE`

    
Set to a filename (str type) that should not be able to be encoded by file
system encoding in strict mode. It may be `None` if it’s not possible to
generate such a filename.

`test.support.TESTFN_UNDECODABLE`

    
Set to a filename (bytes type) that should not be able to be decoded by file
system encoding in strict mode. It may be `None` if it’s not possible to
generate such a filename.

`test.support.TESTFN_NONASCII`

    
Set to a filename containing the `FS_NONASCII` character.

`test.support.LOOPBACK_TIMEOUT`

    
Timeout in seconds for tests using a network server listening on the network
local loopback interface like `127.0.0.1`.

The timeout is long enough to prevent test failure: it takes into account that
the client and the server can run in different threads or even different
processes.

The timeout should be long enough for `connect()`, `recv()` and `send()`
methods of `socket.socket`.

Its default value is 5 seconds.

See also `INTERNET_TIMEOUT`.

`test.support.INTERNET_TIMEOUT`

    
Timeout in seconds for network requests going to the Internet.

The timeout is short enough to prevent a test to wait for too long if the
Internet request is blocked for whatever reason.

Usually, a timeout using `INTERNET_TIMEOUT` should not mark a test as failed,
but skip the test instead: see `transient_internet()`.

Its default value is 1 minute.

See also `LOOPBACK_TIMEOUT`.

`test.support.SHORT_TIMEOUT`

    
Timeout in seconds to mark a test as failed if the test takes “too long”.

The timeout value depends on the regrtest `--timeout` command line option.

If a test using `SHORT_TIMEOUT` starts to fail randomly on slow buildbots, use
`LONG_TIMEOUT` instead.

Its default value is 30 seconds.

`test.support.LONG_TIMEOUT`

    
Timeout in seconds to detect when a test hangs.

It is long enough to reduce the risk of test failure on the slowest Python
buildbots. It should not be used to mark a test as failed if the test takes
“too long”. The timeout value depends on the regrtest `--timeout` command line
option.

Its default value is 5 minutes.

See also `LOOPBACK_TIMEOUT`, `INTERNET_TIMEOUT` and `SHORT_TIMEOUT`.

`test.support.SAVEDCWD`

    
Set to `os.getcwd()`.

`test.support.PGO`

    
Set when tests can be skipped when they are not useful for PGO.

`test.support.PIPE_MAX_SIZE`

    
A constant that is likely larger than the underlying OS pipe buffer size, to
make writes blocking.

`test.support.SOCK_MAX_SIZE`

    
A constant that is likely larger than the underlying OS socket buffer size, to
make writes blocking.

`test.support.TEST_SUPPORT_DIR`

    
Set to the top level directory that contains `test.support`.

`test.support.TEST_HOME_DIR`

    
Set to the top level directory for the test package.

`test.support.TEST_DATA_DIR`

    
Set to the `data` directory within the test package.

`test.support.MAX_Py_ssize_t`

    
Set to `sys.maxsize` for big memory tests.

`test.support.max_memuse`

    
Set by `set_memlimit()` as the memory limit for big memory tests. Limited by
`MAX_Py_ssize_t`.

`test.support.real_max_memuse`

    
Set by `set_memlimit()` as the memory limit for big memory tests. Not limited
by `MAX_Py_ssize_t`.

`test.support.MISSING_C_DOCSTRINGS`

    
Return `True` if running on CPython, not on Windows, and configuration not set
with `WITH_DOC_STRINGS`.

`test.support.HAVE_DOCSTRINGS`

    
Check for presence of docstrings.

`test.support.TEST_HTTP_URL`

    
Define the URL of a dedicated HTTP server for the network tests.

`test.support.ALWAYS_EQ`

    
Object that is equal to anything. Used to test mixed type comparison.

`test.support.NEVER_EQ`

    
Object that is not equal to anything (even to `ALWAYS_EQ`). Used to test mixed
type comparison.

`test.support.LARGEST`

    
Object that is greater than anything (except itself). Used to test mixed type
comparison.

`test.support.SMALLEST`

    
Object that is less than anything (except itself). Used to test mixed type
comparison.

The `test.support` module defines the following functions:

`test.support.forget(module_name)`

    
Remove the module named module_name from `sys.modules` and delete any byte-
compiled files of the module.

`test.support.unload(name)`

    
Delete name from `sys.modules`.

`test.support.unlink(filename)`

    
Call `os.unlink()` on filename. On Windows platforms, this is wrapped with a
wait loop that checks for the existence fo the file.

`test.support.rmdir(filename)`

    
Call `os.rmdir()` on filename. On Windows platforms, this is wrapped with a
wait loop that checks for the existence of the file.

`test.support.rmtree(path)`

    
Call `shutil.rmtree()` on path or call `os.lstat()` and `os.rmdir()` to remove
a path and its contents. On Windows platforms, this is wrapped with a wait
loop that checks for the existence of the files.

`test.support.make_legacy_pyc(source)`

    
Move a PEP 3147/PEP 488 pyc file to its legacy pyc location and return the
file system path to the legacy pyc file. The source value is the file system
path to the source file. It does not need to exist, however the PEP 3147/488
pyc file must exist.

`test.support.is_resource_enabled(resource)`

    
Return `True` if resource is enabled and available. The list of available
resources is only set when `test.regrtest` is executing the tests.

`test.support.python_is_optimized()`

    
Return `True` if Python was not built with `-O0` or `-Og`.

`test.support.with_pymalloc()`

    
Return `_testcapi.WITH_PYMALLOC`.

`test.support.requires(resource, msg=None)`

    
Raise `ResourceDenied` if resource is not available. msg is the argument to
`ResourceDenied` if it is raised. Always returns `True` if called by a
function whose `__name__` is `'__main__'`. Used when tests are executed by
`test.regrtest`.

`test.support.system_must_validate_cert(f)`

    
Raise `unittest.SkipTest` on TLS certification validation failures.

`test.support.sortdict(dict)`

    
Return a repr of dict with keys sorted.

`test.support.findfile(filename, subdir=None)`

    
Return the path to the file named filename. If no match is found filename is
returned. This does not equal a failure since it could be the path to the
file.

Setting subdir indicates a relative path to use to find the file rather than
looking directly in the path directories.

`test.support.create_empty_file(filename)`

    
Create an empty file with filename. If it already exists, truncate it.

`test.support.fd_count()`

    
Count the number of open file descriptors.

`test.support.match_test(test)`

    
Match test to patterns set in `set_match_tests()`.

`test.support.set_match_tests(patterns)`

    
Define match test with regular expression patterns.

`test.support.run_unittest(*classes)`

    
Execute `unittest.TestCase` subclasses passed to the function. The function
scans the classes for methods starting with the prefix `test_` and executes
the tests individually.

It is also legal to pass strings as parameters; these should be keys in
`sys.modules`. Each associated module will be scanned by
`unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule()`. This is usually seen in the
following `test_main()` function:

    
    def test_main():
        support.run_unittest(__name__)
    
This will run all tests defined in the named module.

`test.support.run_doctest(module, verbosity=None, optionflags=0)`

    
Run `doctest.testmod()` on the given module. Return `(failure_count,
test_count)`.

If verbosity is `None`, `doctest.testmod()` is run with verbosity set to
`verbose`. Otherwise, it is run with verbosity set to `None`. optionflags is
passed as `optionflags` to `doctest.testmod()`.

`test.support.setswitchinterval(interval)`

    
Set the `sys.setswitchinterval()` to the given interval. Defines a minimum
interval for Android systems to prevent the system from hanging.

`test.support.check_impl_detail(**guards)`

    
Use this check to guard CPython’s implementation-specific tests or to run them
only on the implementations guarded by the arguments:

    
    check_impl_detail()               # Only on CPython (default).
    check_impl_detail(jython=True)    # Only on Jython.
    check_impl_detail(cpython=False)  # Everywhere except CPython.
    
`test.support.check_warnings(*filters, quiet=True)`

    
A convenience wrapper for `warnings.catch_warnings()` that makes it easier to
test that a warning was correctly raised. It is approximately equivalent to
calling `warnings.catch_warnings(record=True)` with `warnings.simplefilter()`
set to `always` and with the option to automatically validate the results that
are recorded.

`check_warnings` accepts 2-tuples of the form `("message regexp",
WarningCategory)` as positional arguments. If one or more filters are
provided, or if the optional keyword argument quiet is `False`, it checks to
make sure the warnings are as expected: each specified filter must match at
least one of the warnings raised by the enclosed code or the test fails, and
if any warnings are raised that do not match any of the specified filters the
test fails. To disable the first of these checks, set quiet to `True`.

If no arguments are specified, it defaults to:

    
    check_warnings(("", Warning), quiet=True)
    
In this case all warnings are caught and no errors are raised.

On entry to the context manager, a `WarningRecorder` instance is returned. The
underlying warnings list from `catch_warnings()` is available via the recorder
object’s `warnings` attribute. As a convenience, the attributes of the object
representing the most recent warning can also be accessed directly through the
recorder object (see example below). If no warning has been raised, then any
of the attributes that would otherwise be expected on an object representing a
warning will return `None`.

The recorder object also has a `reset()` method, which clears the warnings
list.

The context manager is designed to be used like this:

    
    with check_warnings(("assertion is always true", SyntaxWarning),
                        ("", UserWarning)):
        exec('assert(False, "Hey!")')
        warnings.warn(UserWarning("Hide me!"))
    
In this case if either warning was not raised, or some other warning was
raised, `check_warnings()` would raise an error.

When a test needs to look more deeply into the warnings, rather than just
checking whether or not they occurred, code like this can be used:

    
    with check_warnings(quiet=True) as w:
        warnings.warn("foo")
        assert str(w.args[0]) == "foo"
        warnings.warn("bar")
        assert str(w.args[0]) == "bar"
        assert str(w.warnings[0].args[0]) == "foo"
        assert str(w.warnings[1].args[0]) == "bar"
        w.reset()
        assert len(w.warnings) == 0
    
Here all warnings will be caught, and the test code tests the captured
warnings directly.

Changed in version 3.2: New optional arguments filters and quiet.

`test.support.check_no_resource_warning(testcase)`

    
Context manager to check that no `ResourceWarning` was raised. You must remove
the object which may emit `ResourceWarning` before the end of the context
manager.

`test.support.set_memlimit(limit)`

    
Set the values for `max_memuse` and `real_max_memuse` for big memory tests.

`test.support.record_original_stdout(stdout)`

    
Store the value from stdout. It is meant to hold the stdout at the time the
regrtest began.

`test.support.get_original_stdout()`

    
Return the original stdout set by `record_original_stdout()` or `sys.stdout`
if it’s not set.

`test.support.args_from_interpreter_flags()`

    
Return a list of command line arguments reproducing the current settings in
`sys.flags` and `sys.warnoptions`.

`test.support.optim_args_from_interpreter_flags()`

    
Return a list of command line arguments reproducing the current optimization
settings in `sys.flags`.

`test.support.captured_stdin()`

`test.support.captured_stdout()`

`test.support.captured_stderr()`

    
A context managers that temporarily replaces the named stream with
`io.StringIO` object.

Example use with output streams:

    
    with captured_stdout() as stdout, captured_stderr() as stderr:
        print("hello")
        print("error", file=sys.stderr)
    assert stdout.getvalue() == "hello\n"
    assert stderr.getvalue() == "error\n"
    
Example use with input stream:

    
    with captured_stdin() as stdin:
        stdin.write('hello\n')
        stdin.seek(0)
        # call test code that consumes from sys.stdin
        captured = input()
    self.assertEqual(captured, "hello")
    
`test.support.temp_dir(path=None, quiet=False)`

    
A context manager that creates a temporary directory at path and yields the
directory.

If path is `None`, the temporary directory is created using
`tempfile.mkdtemp()`. If quiet is `False`, the context manager raises an
exception on error. Otherwise, if path is specified and cannot be created,
only a warning is issued.

`test.support.change_cwd(path, quiet=False)`

    
A context manager that temporarily changes the current working directory to
path and yields the directory.

If quiet is `False`, the context manager raises an exception on error.
Otherwise, it issues only a warning and keeps the current working directory
the same.

`test.support.temp_cwd(name='tempcwd', quiet=False)`

    
A context manager that temporarily creates a new directory and changes the
current working directory (CWD).

The context manager creates a temporary directory in the current directory
with name name before temporarily changing the current working directory. If
name is `None`, the temporary directory is created using `tempfile.mkdtemp()`.

If quiet is `False` and it is not possible to create or change the CWD, an
error is raised. Otherwise, only a warning is raised and the original CWD is
used.

`test.support.temp_umask(umask)`

    
A context manager that temporarily sets the process umask.

`test.support.disable_faulthandler()`

    
A context manager that replaces `sys.stderr` with `sys.__stderr__`.

`test.support.gc_collect()`

    
Force as many objects as possible to be collected. This is needed because
timely deallocation is not guaranteed by the garbage collector. This means
that `__del__` methods may be called later than expected and weakrefs may
remain alive for longer than expected.

`test.support.disable_gc()`

    
A context manager that disables the garbage collector upon entry and reenables
it upon exit.

`test.support.swap_attr(obj, attr, new_val)`

    
Context manager to swap out an attribute with a new object.

Usage:

    
    with swap_attr(obj, "attr", 5):
        ...
    
This will set `obj.attr` to 5 for the duration of the `with` block, restoring
the old value at the end of the block. If `attr` doesn’t exist on `obj`, it
will be created and then deleted at the end of the block.

The old value (or `None` if it doesn’t exist) will be assigned to the target
of the “as” clause, if there is one.

`test.support.swap_item(obj, attr, new_val)`

    
Context manager to swap out an item with a new object.

Usage:

    
    with swap_item(obj, "item", 5):
        ...
    
This will set `obj["item"]` to 5 for the duration of the `with` block,
restoring the old value at the end of the block. If `item` doesn’t exist on
`obj`, it will be created and then deleted at the end of the block.

The old value (or `None` if it doesn’t exist) will be assigned to the target
of the “as” clause, if there is one.

`test.support.print_warning(msg)`

    
Print a warning into `sys.__stderr__`. Format the message as: `f"Warning --
{msg}"`. If msg is made of multiple lines, add `"Warning -- "` prefix to each
line.

New in version 3.9.

`test.support.wait_process(pid, *, exitcode, timeout=None)`

    
Wait until process pid completes and check that the process exit code is
exitcode.

Raise an `AssertionError` if the process exit code is not equal to exitcode.

If the process runs longer than timeout seconds (`SHORT_TIMEOUT` by default),
kill the process and raise an `AssertionError`. The timeout feature is not
available on Windows.

New in version 3.9.

`test.support.wait_threads_exit(timeout=60.0)`

    
Context manager to wait until all threads created in the `with` statement
exit.

`test.support.start_threads(threads, unlock=None)`

    
Context manager to start threads. It attempts to join the threads upon exit.

`test.support.calcobjsize(fmt)`

    
Return `struct.calcsize()` for `nP{fmt}0n` or, if `gettotalrefcount` exists,
`2PnP{fmt}0P`.

`test.support.calcvobjsize(fmt)`

    
Return `struct.calcsize()` for `nPn{fmt}0n` or, if `gettotalrefcount` exists,
`2PnPn{fmt}0P`.

`test.support.checksizeof(test, o, size)`

    
For testcase test, assert that the `sys.getsizeof` for o plus the GC header
size equals size.

`test.support.can_symlink()`

    
Return `True` if the OS supports symbolic links, `False` otherwise.

`test.support.can_xattr()`

    
Return `True` if the OS supports xattr, `False` otherwise.

`@test.support.skip_unless_symlink`

    
A decorator for running tests that require support for symbolic links.

`@test.support.skip_unless_xattr`

    
A decorator for running tests that require support for xattr.

`@test.support.anticipate_failure(condition)`

    
A decorator to conditionally mark tests with `unittest.expectedFailure()`. Any
use of this decorator should have an associated comment identifying the
relevant tracker issue.

`@test.support.run_with_locale(catstr, *locales)`

    
A decorator for running a function in a different locale, correctly resetting
it after it has finished. catstr is the locale category as a string (for
example `"LC_ALL"`). The locales passed will be tried sequentially, and the
first valid locale will be used.

`@test.support.run_with_tz(tz)`

    
A decorator for running a function in a specific timezone, correctly resetting
it after it has finished.

`@test.support.requires_freebsd_version(*min_version)`

    
Decorator for the minimum version when running test on FreeBSD. If the FreeBSD
version is less than the minimum, raise `unittest.SkipTest`.

`@test.support.requires_linux_version(*min_version)`

    
Decorator for the minimum version when running test on Linux. If the Linux
version is less than the minimum, raise `unittest.SkipTest`.

`@test.support.requires_mac_version(*min_version)`

    
Decorator for the minimum version when running test on Mac OS X. If the MAC OS
X version is less than the minimum, raise `unittest.SkipTest`.

`@test.support.requires_IEEE_754`

    
Decorator for skipping tests on non-IEEE 754 platforms.

`@test.support.requires_zlib`

    
Decorator for skipping tests if `zlib` doesn’t exist.

`@test.support.requires_gzip`

    
Decorator for skipping tests if `gzip` doesn’t exist.

`@test.support.requires_bz2`

    
Decorator for skipping tests if `bz2` doesn’t exist.

`@test.support.requires_lzma`

    
Decorator for skipping tests if `lzma` doesn’t exist.

`@test.support.requires_resource(resource)`

    
Decorator for skipping tests if resource is not available.

`@test.support.requires_docstrings`

    
Decorator for only running the test if `HAVE_DOCSTRINGS`.

`@test.support.cpython_only(test)`

    
Decorator for tests only applicable to CPython.

`@test.support.impl_detail(msg=None, **guards)`

    
Decorator for invoking `check_impl_detail()` on guards. If that returns
`False`, then uses msg as the reason for skipping the test.

`@test.support.no_tracing(func)`

    
Decorator to temporarily turn off tracing for the duration of the test.

`@test.support.refcount_test(test)`

    
Decorator for tests which involve reference counting. The decorator does not
run the test if it is not run by CPython. Any trace function is unset for the
duration of the test to prevent unexpected refcounts caused by the trace
function.

`@test.support.reap_threads(func)`

    
Decorator to ensure the threads are cleaned up even if the test fails.

`@test.support.bigmemtest(size, memuse, dry_run=True)`

    
Decorator for bigmem tests.

size is a requested size for the test (in arbitrary, test-interpreted units.)
memuse is the number of bytes per unit for the test, or a good estimate of it.
For example, a test that needs two byte buffers, of 4 GiB each, could be
decorated with `@bigmemtest(size=_4G, memuse=2)`.

The size argument is normally passed to the decorated test method as an extra
argument. If dry_run is `True`, the value passed to the test method may be
less than the requested value. If dry_run is `False`, it means the test
doesn’t support dummy runs when `-M` is not specified.

`@test.support.bigaddrspacetest(f)`

    
Decorator for tests that fill the address space. f is the function to wrap.

`test.support.make_bad_fd()`

    
Create an invalid file descriptor by opening and closing a temporary file, and
returning its descriptor.

`test.support.check_syntax_error(testcase, statement, errtext='', *,
lineno=None, offset=None)`

    
Test for syntax errors in statement by attempting to compile statement.
testcase is the `unittest` instance for the test. errtext is the regular
expression which should match the string representation of the raised
`SyntaxError`. If lineno is not `None`, compares to the line of the exception.
If offset is not `None`, compares to the offset of the exception.

`test.support.check_syntax_warning(testcase, statement, errtext='', *,
lineno=1, offset=None)`

    
Test for syntax warning in statement by attempting to compile statement. Test
also that the `SyntaxWarning` is emitted only once, and that it will be
converted to a `SyntaxError` when turned into error. testcase is the
`unittest` instance for the test. errtext is the regular expression which
should match the string representation of the emitted `SyntaxWarning` and
raised `SyntaxError`. If lineno is not `None`, compares to the line of the
warning and exception. If offset is not `None`, compares to the offset of the
exception.

New in version 3.8.

`test.support.open_urlresource(url, *args, **kw)`

    
Open url. If open fails, raises `TestFailed`.

`test.support.import_module(name, deprecated=False, *, required_on())`

    
This function imports and returns the named module. Unlike a normal import,
this function raises `unittest.SkipTest` if the module cannot be imported.

Module and package deprecation messages are suppressed during this import if
deprecated is `True`. If a module is required on a platform but optional for
others, set required_on to an iterable of platform prefixes which will be
compared against `sys.platform`.

New in version 3.1.

`test.support.import_fresh_module(name, fresh=(), blocked=(),
deprecated=False)`

    
This function imports and returns a fresh copy of the named Python module by
removing the named module from `sys.modules` before doing the import. Note
that unlike `reload()`, the original module is not affected by this operation.

fresh is an iterable of additional module names that are also removed from the
`sys.modules` cache before doing the import.

blocked is an iterable of module names that are replaced with `None` in the
module cache during the import to ensure that attempts to import them raise
`ImportError`.

The named module and any modules named in the fresh and blocked parameters are
saved before starting the import and then reinserted into `sys.modules` when
the fresh import is complete.

Module and package deprecation messages are suppressed during this import if
deprecated is `True`.

This function will raise `ImportError` if the named module cannot be imported.

Example use:

    
    # Get copies of the warnings module for testing without affecting the
    # version being used by the rest of the test suite. One copy uses the
    # C implementation, the other is forced to use the pure Python fallback
    # implementation
    py_warnings = import_fresh_module('warnings', blocked=['_warnings'])
    c_warnings = import_fresh_module('warnings', fresh=['_warnings'])
    
New in version 3.1.

`test.support.modules_setup()`

    
Return a copy of `sys.modules`.

`test.support.modules_cleanup(oldmodules)`

    
Remove modules except for oldmodules and `encodings` in order to preserve
internal cache.

`test.support.threading_setup()`

    
Return current thread count and copy of dangling threads.

`test.support.threading_cleanup(*original_values)`

    
Cleanup up threads not specified in original_values. Designed to emit a
warning if a test leaves running threads in the background.

`test.support.join_thread(thread, timeout=30.0)`

    
Join a thread within timeout. Raise an `AssertionError` if thread is still
alive after timeout seconds.

`test.support.reap_children()`

    
Use this at the end of `test_main` whenever sub-processes are started. This
will help ensure that no extra children (zombies) stick around to hog
resources and create problems when looking for refleaks.

`test.support.get_attribute(obj, name)`

    
Get an attribute, raising `unittest.SkipTest` if `AttributeError` is raised.

`test.support.catch_threading_exception()`

    
Context manager catching `threading.Thread` exception using
`threading.excepthook()`.

Attributes set when an exception is catched:

  * `exc_type`
  * `exc_value`
  * `exc_traceback`
  * `thread`

See `threading.excepthook()` documentation.

These attributes are deleted at the context manager exit.

Usage:

    
    with support.catch_threading_exception() as cm:
        # code spawning a thread which raises an exception
        ...
    
        # check the thread exception, use cm attributes:
        # exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback, thread
        ...
    
    # exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback, thread attributes of cm no longer
    # exists at this point
    # (to avoid reference cycles)
    
New in version 3.8.

`test.support.catch_unraisable_exception()`

    
Context manager catching unraisable exception using `sys.unraisablehook()`.

Storing the exception value (`cm.unraisable.exc_value`) creates a reference
cycle. The reference cycle is broken explicitly when the context manager
exits.

Storing the object (`cm.unraisable.object`) can resurrect it if it is set to
an object which is being finalized. Exiting the context manager clears the
stored object.

Usage:

    
    with support.catch_unraisable_exception() as cm:
        # code creating an "unraisable exception"
        ...
    
        # check the unraisable exception: use cm.unraisable
        ...
    
    # cm.unraisable attribute no longer exists at this point
    # (to break a reference cycle)
    
New in version 3.8.

`test.support.load_package_tests(pkg_dir, loader, standard_tests, pattern)`

    
Generic implementation of the `unittest` `load_tests` protocol for use in test
packages. pkg_dir is the root directory of the package; loader,
standard_tests, and pattern are the arguments expected by `load_tests`. In
simple cases, the test package’s `__init__.py` can be the following:

    
    import os
    from test.support import load_package_tests
    
    def load_tests(*args):
        return load_package_tests(os.path.dirname(__file__), *args)
    
`test.support.fs_is_case_insensitive(directory)`

    
Return `True` if the file system for directory is case-insensitive.

`test.support.detect_api_mismatch(ref_api, other_api, *, ignore=())`

    
Returns the set of attributes, functions or methods of ref_api not found on
other_api, except for a defined list of items to be ignored in this check
specified in ignore.

By default this skips private attributes beginning with ‘_’ but includes all
magic methods, i.e. those starting and ending in ‘__’.

New in version 3.5.

`test.support.patch(test_instance, object_to_patch, attr_name, new_value)`

    
Override object_to_patch.attr_name with new_value. Also add cleanup procedure
to test_instance to restore object_to_patch for attr_name. The attr_name
should be a valid attribute for object_to_patch.

`test.support.run_in_subinterp(code)`

    
Run code in subinterpreter. Raise `unittest.SkipTest` if `tracemalloc` is
enabled.

`test.support.check_free_after_iterating(test, iter, cls, args=())`

    
Assert that iter is deallocated after iterating.

`test.support.missing_compiler_executable(cmd_names=[])`

    
Check for the existence of the compiler executables whose names are listed in
cmd_names or all the compiler executables when cmd_names is empty and return
the first missing executable or `None` when none is found missing.

`test.support.check__all__(test_case, module, name_of_module=None, extra=(),
blacklist=())`

    
Assert that the `__all__` variable of module contains all public names.

The module’s public names (its API) are detected automatically based on
whether they match the public name convention and were defined in module.

The name_of_module argument can specify (as a string or tuple thereof) what
module(s) an API could be defined in order to be detected as a public API. One
case for this is when module imports part of its public API from other
modules, possibly a C backend (like `csv` and its `_csv`).

The extra argument can be a set of names that wouldn’t otherwise be
automatically detected as “public”, like objects without a proper `__module__`
attribute. If provided, it will be added to the automatically detected ones.

The blacklist argument can be a set of names that must not be treated as part
of the public API even though their names indicate otherwise.

Example use:

    
    import bar
    import foo
    import unittest
    from test import support
    
    class MiscTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        def test__all__(self):
            support.check__all__(self, foo)
    
    class OtherTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        def test__all__(self):
            extra = {'BAR_CONST', 'FOO_CONST'}
            blacklist = {'baz'}  # Undocumented name.
            # bar imports part of its API from _bar.
            support.check__all__(self, bar, ('bar', '_bar'),
                                 extra=extra, blacklist=blacklist)
    
New in version 3.6.

The `test.support` module defines the following classes:

`class test.support.TransientResource(exc, **kwargs)`

    
Instances are a context manager that raises `ResourceDenied` if the specified
exception type is raised. Any keyword arguments are treated as attribute/value
pairs to be compared against any exception raised within the `with` statement.
Only if all pairs match properly against attributes on the exception is
`ResourceDenied` raised.

`class test.support.EnvironmentVarGuard`

    
Class used to temporarily set or unset environment variables. Instances can be
used as a context manager and have a complete dictionary interface for
querying/modifying the underlying `os.environ`. After exit from the context
manager all changes to environment variables done through this instance will
be rolled back.

Changed in version 3.1: Added dictionary interface.

`EnvironmentVarGuard.set(envvar, value)`

    
Temporarily set the environment variable `envvar` to the value of `value`.

`EnvironmentVarGuard.unset(envvar)`

    
Temporarily unset the environment variable `envvar`.

`class test.support.SuppressCrashReport`

    
A context manager used to try to prevent crash dialog popups on tests that are
expected to crash a subprocess.

On Windows, it disables Windows Error Reporting dialogs using SetErrorMode.

On UNIX, `resource.setrlimit()` is used to set `resource.RLIMIT_CORE`’s soft
limit to 0 to prevent coredump file creation.

On both platforms, the old value is restored by `__exit__()`.

`class test.support.CleanImport(*module_names)`

    
A context manager to force import to return a new module reference. This is
useful for testing module-level behaviors, such as the emission of a
DeprecationWarning on import. Example usage:

    
    with CleanImport('foo'):
        importlib.import_module('foo')  # New reference.
    
`class test.support.DirsOnSysPath(*paths)`

    
A context manager to temporarily add directories to sys.path.

This makes a copy of `sys.path`, appends any directories given as positional
arguments, then reverts `sys.path` to the copied settings when the context
ends.

Note that all `sys.path` modifications in the body of the context manager,
including replacement of the object, will be reverted at the end of the block.

`class test.support.SaveSignals`

    
Class to save and restore signal handlers registered by the Python signal
handler.

`class test.support.Matcher`

    
`matches(self, d, **kwargs)`

    
Try to match a single dict with the supplied arguments.

`match_value(self, k, dv, v)`

    
Try to match a single stored value (dv) with a supplied value (v).

`class test.support.WarningsRecorder`

    
Class used to record warnings for unit tests. See documentation of
`check_warnings()` above for more details.

`class test.support.BasicTestRunner`

    
`run(test)`

    
Run test and return the result.

`class test.support.FakePath(path)`

    
Simple path-like object. It implements the `__fspath__()` method which just
returns the path argument. If path is an exception, it will be raised in
`__fspath__()`.

# test.support.socket_helper — Utilities for socket tests

The `test.support.socket_helper` module provides support for socket tests.

New in version 3.9.

`test.support.socket_helper.IPV6_ENABLED`

    
Set to `True` if IPv6 is enabled on this host, `False` otherwise.

`test.support.socket_helper.find_unused_port(family=socket.AF_INET,
socktype=socket.SOCK_STREAM)`

    
Returns an unused port that should be suitable for binding. This is achieved
by creating a temporary socket with the same family and type as the `sock`
parameter (default is `AF_INET`, `SOCK_STREAM`), and binding it to the
specified host address (defaults to `0.0.0.0`) with the port set to 0,
eliciting an unused ephemeral port from the OS. The temporary socket is then
closed and deleted, and the ephemeral port is returned.

Either this method or `bind_port()` should be used for any tests where a
server socket needs to be bound to a particular port for the duration of the
test. Which one to use depends on whether the calling code is creating a
Python socket, or if an unused port needs to be provided in a constructor or
passed to an external program (i.e. the `-accept` argument to openssl’s
s_server mode). Always prefer `bind_port()` over `find_unused_port()` where
possible. Using a hard coded port is discouraged since it can make multiple
instances of the test impossible to run simultaneously, which is a problem for
buildbots.

`test.support.socket_helper.bind_port(sock, host=HOST)`

    
Bind the socket to a free port and return the port number. Relies on ephemeral
ports in order to ensure we are using an unbound port. This is important as
many tests may be running simultaneously, especially in a buildbot
environment. This method raises an exception if the `sock.family` is `AF_INET`
and `sock.type` is `SOCK_STREAM`, and the socket has `SO_REUSEADDR` or
`SO_REUSEPORT` set on it. Tests should never set these socket options for
TCP/IP sockets. The only case for setting these options is testing
multicasting via multiple UDP sockets.

Additionally, if the `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` socket option is available (i.e. on
Windows), it will be set on the socket. This will prevent anyone else from
binding to our host/port for the duration of the test.

`test.support.socket_helper.bind_unix_socket(sock, addr)`

    
Bind a unix socket, raising `unittest.SkipTest` if `PermissionError` is
raised.

`@test.support.socket_helper.skip_unless_bind_unix_socket`

    
A decorator for running tests that require a functional `bind()` for Unix
sockets.

`test.support.socket_helper.transient_internet(resource_name, *, timeout=30.0,
errnos=())`

    
A context manager that raises `ResourceDenied` when various issues with the
internet connection manifest themselves as exceptions.

# test.support.script_helper — Utilities for the Python execution tests

The `test.support.script_helper` module provides support for Python’s script
execution tests.

`test.support.script_helper.interpreter_requires_environment()`

    
Return `True` if `sys.executable interpreter` requires environment variables
in order to be able to run at all.

This is designed to be used with `@unittest.skipIf()` to annotate tests that
need to use an `assert_python*()` function to launch an isolated mode (`-I`)
or no environment mode (`-E`) sub-interpreter process.

A normal build & test does not run into this situation but it can happen when
trying to run the standard library test suite from an interpreter that doesn’t
have an obvious home with Python’s current home finding logic.

Setting `PYTHONHOME` is one way to get most of the testsuite to run in that
situation. `PYTHONPATH` or `PYTHONUSERSITE` are other common environment
variables that might impact whether or not the interpreter can start.

`test.support.script_helper.run_python_until_end(*args, **env_vars)`

    
Set up the environment based on env_vars for running the interpreter in a
subprocess. The values can include `__isolated`, `__cleanenv`, `__cwd`, and
`TERM`.

Changed in version 3.9: The function no longer strips whitespaces from stderr.

`test.support.script_helper.assert_python_ok(*args, **env_vars)`

    
Assert that running the interpreter with args and optional environment
variables env_vars succeeds (`rc == 0`) and return a `(return code, stdout,
stderr)` tuple.

If the `__cleanenv` keyword is set, env_vars is used as a fresh environment.

Python is started in isolated mode (command line option `-I`), except if the
`__isolated` keyword is set to `False`.

Changed in version 3.9: The function no longer strips whitespaces from stderr.

`test.support.script_helper.assert_python_failure(*args, **env_vars)`

    
Assert that running the interpreter with args and optional environment
variables env_vars fails (`rc != 0`) and return a `(return code, stdout,
stderr)` tuple.

See `assert_python_ok()` for more options.

Changed in version 3.9: The function no longer strips whitespaces from stderr.

`test.support.script_helper.spawn_python(*args, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, **kw)`

    
Run a Python subprocess with the given arguments.

kw is extra keyword args to pass to `subprocess.Popen()`. Returns a
`subprocess.Popen` object.

`test.support.script_helper.kill_python(p)`

    
Run the given `subprocess.Popen` process until completion and return stdout.

`test.support.script_helper.make_script(script_dir, script_basename, source,
omit_suffix=False)`

    
Create script containing source in path script_dir and script_basename. If
omit_suffix is `False`, append `.py` to the name. Return the full script path.

`test.support.script_helper.make_zip_script(zip_dir, zip_basename,
script_name, name_in_zip=None)`

    
Create zip file at zip_dir and zip_basename with extension `zip` which
contains the files in script_name. name_in_zip is the archive name. Return a
tuple containing `(full path, full path of archive name)`.

`test.support.script_helper.make_pkg(pkg_dir, init_source='')`

    
Create a directory named pkg_dir containing an `__init__` file with
init_source as its contents.

`test.support.script_helper.make_zip_pkg(zip_dir, zip_basename, pkg_name,
script_basename, source, depth=1, compiled=False)`

    
Create a zip package directory with a path of zip_dir and zip_basename
containing an empty `__init__` file and a file script_basename containing the
source. If compiled is `True`, both source files will be compiled and added to
the zip package. Return a tuple of the full zip path and the archive name for
the zip file.

# test.support.bytecode_helper — Support tools for testing correct bytecode
generation

The `test.support.bytecode_helper` module provides support for testing and
inspecting bytecode generation.

New in version 3.9.

The module defines the following class:

`class test.support.bytecode_helper.BytecodeTestCase(unittest.TestCase)`

    
This class has custom assertion methods for inspecting bytecode.

`BytecodeTestCase.get_disassembly_as_string(co)`

    
Return the disassembly of co as string.

`BytecodeTestCase.assertInBytecode(x, opname, argval=_UNSPECIFIED)`

    
Return instr if opname is found, otherwise throws `AssertionError`.

`BytecodeTestCase.assertNotInBytecode(x, opname, argval=_UNSPECIFIED)`

    
Throws `AssertionError` if opname is found.
