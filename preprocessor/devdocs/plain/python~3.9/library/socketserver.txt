# socketserver — A framework for network servers

Source code: Lib/socketserver.py

The `socketserver` module simplifies the task of writing network servers.

There are four basic concrete server classes:

`class socketserver.TCPServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass,
bind_and_activate=True)`

    
This uses the Internet TCP protocol, which provides for continuous streams of
data between the client and server. If bind_and_activate is true, the
constructor automatically attempts to invoke `server_bind()` and
`server_activate()`. The other parameters are passed to the `BaseServer` base
class.

`class socketserver.UDPServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass,
bind_and_activate=True)`

    
This uses datagrams, which are discrete packets of information that may arrive
out of order or be lost while in transit. The parameters are the same as for
`TCPServer`.

`class socketserver.UnixStreamServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass,
bind_and_activate=True)`

`class socketserver.UnixDatagramServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass,
bind_and_activate=True)`

    
These more infrequently used classes are similar to the TCP and UDP classes,
but use Unix domain sockets; they’re not available on non-Unix platforms. The
parameters are the same as for `TCPServer`.

These four classes process requests synchronously; each request must be
completed before the next request can be started. This isn’t suitable if each
request takes a long time to complete, because it requires a lot of
computation, or because it returns a lot of data which the client is slow to
process. The solution is to create a separate process or thread to handle each
request; the `ForkingMixIn` and `ThreadingMixIn` mix-in classes can be used to
support asynchronous behaviour.

Creating a server requires several steps. First, you must create a request
handler class by subclassing the `BaseRequestHandler` class and overriding its
`handle()` method; this method will process incoming requests. Second, you
must instantiate one of the server classes, passing it the server’s address
and the request handler class. It is recommended to use the server in a `with`
statement. Then call the `handle_request()` or `serve_forever()` method of the
server object to process one or many requests. Finally, call `server_close()`
to close the socket (unless you used a `with` statement).

When inheriting from `ThreadingMixIn` for threaded connection behavior, you
should explicitly declare how you want your threads to behave on an abrupt
shutdown. The `ThreadingMixIn` class defines an attribute daemon_threads,
which indicates whether or not the server should wait for thread termination.
You should set the flag explicitly if you would like threads to behave
autonomously; the default is `False`, meaning that Python will not exit until
all threads created by `ThreadingMixIn` have exited.

Server classes have the same external methods and attributes, no matter what
network protocol they use.

## Server Creation Notes

There are five classes in an inheritance diagram, four of which represent
synchronous servers of four types:

    
    +------------+
    | BaseServer |
    +------------+
          |
          v
    +-----------+        +------------------+
    | TCPServer |------->| UnixStreamServer |
    +-----------+        +------------------+
          |
          v
    +-----------+        +--------------------+
    | UDPServer |------->| UnixDatagramServer |
    +-----------+        +--------------------+
    
Note that `UnixDatagramServer` derives from `UDPServer`, not from
`UnixStreamServer` — the only difference between an IP and a Unix stream
server is the address family, which is simply repeated in both Unix server
classes.

`class socketserver.ForkingMixIn`

`class socketserver.ThreadingMixIn`

    
Forking and threading versions of each type of server can be created using
these mix-in classes. For instance, `ThreadingUDPServer` is created as
follows:

    
    class ThreadingUDPServer(ThreadingMixIn, UDPServer):
        pass
    
The mix-in class comes first, since it overrides a method defined in
`UDPServer`. Setting the various attributes also changes the behavior of the
underlying server mechanism.

`ForkingMixIn` and the Forking classes mentioned below are only available on
POSIX platforms that support `fork()`.

`socketserver.ForkingMixIn.server_close()` waits until all child processes
complete, except if `socketserver.ForkingMixIn.block_on_close` attribute is
false.

`socketserver.ThreadingMixIn.server_close()` waits until all non-daemon
threads complete, except if `socketserver.ThreadingMixIn.block_on_close`
attribute is false. Use daemonic threads by setting
`ThreadingMixIn.daemon_threads` to `True` to not wait until threads complete.

Changed in version 3.7: `socketserver.ForkingMixIn.server_close()` and
`socketserver.ThreadingMixIn.server_close()` now waits until all child
processes and non-daemonic threads complete. Add a new
`socketserver.ForkingMixIn.block_on_close` class attribute to opt-in for the
pre-3.7 behaviour.

`class socketserver.ForkingTCPServer`

`class socketserver.ForkingUDPServer`

`class socketserver.ThreadingTCPServer`

`class socketserver.ThreadingUDPServer`

    
These classes are pre-defined using the mix-in classes.

To implement a service, you must derive a class from `BaseRequestHandler` and
redefine its `handle()` method. You can then run various versions of the
service by combining one of the server classes with your request handler
class. The request handler class must be different for datagram or stream
services. This can be hidden by using the handler subclasses
`StreamRequestHandler` or `DatagramRequestHandler`.

Of course, you still have to use your head! For instance, it makes no sense to
use a forking server if the service contains state in memory that can be
modified by different requests, since the modifications in the child process
would never reach the initial state kept in the parent process and passed to
each child. In this case, you can use a threading server, but you will
probably have to use locks to protect the integrity of the shared data.

On the other hand, if you are building an HTTP server where all data is stored
externally (for instance, in the file system), a synchronous class will
essentially render the service “deaf” while one request is being handled –
which may be for a very long time if a client is slow to receive all the data
it has requested. Here a threading or forking server is appropriate.

In some cases, it may be appropriate to process part of a request
synchronously, but to finish processing in a forked child depending on the
request data. This can be implemented by using a synchronous server and doing
an explicit fork in the request handler class `handle()` method.

Another approach to handling multiple simultaneous requests in an environment
that supports neither threads nor `fork()` (or where these are too expensive
or inappropriate for the service) is to maintain an explicit table of
partially finished requests and to use `selectors` to decide which request to
work on next (or whether to handle a new incoming request). This is
particularly important for stream services where each client can potentially
be connected for a long time (if threads or subprocesses cannot be used). See
`asyncore` for another way to manage this.

## Server Objects

`class socketserver.BaseServer(server_address, RequestHandlerClass)`

    
This is the superclass of all Server objects in the module. It defines the
interface, given below, but does not implement most of the methods, which is
done in subclasses. The two parameters are stored in the respective
`server_address` and `RequestHandlerClass` attributes.

`fileno()`

    
Return an integer file descriptor for the socket on which the server is
listening. This function is most commonly passed to `selectors`, to allow
monitoring multiple servers in the same process.

`handle_request()`

    
Process a single request. This function calls the following methods in order:
`get_request()`, `verify_request()`, and `process_request()`. If the user-
provided `handle()` method of the handler class raises an exception, the
server’s `handle_error()` method will be called. If no request is received
within `timeout` seconds, `handle_timeout()` will be called and
`handle_request()` will return.

`serve_forever(poll_interval=0.5)`

    
Handle requests until an explicit `shutdown()` request. Poll for shutdown
every poll_interval seconds. Ignores the `timeout` attribute. It also calls
`service_actions()`, which may be used by a subclass or mixin to provide
actions specific to a given service. For example, the `ForkingMixIn` class
uses `service_actions()` to clean up zombie child processes.

Changed in version 3.3: Added `service_actions` call to the `serve_forever`
method.

`service_actions()`

    
This is called in the `serve_forever()` loop. This method can be overridden by
subclasses or mixin classes to perform actions specific to a given service,
such as cleanup actions.

New in version 3.3.

`shutdown()`

    
Tell the `serve_forever()` loop to stop and wait until it does. `shutdown()`
must be called while `serve_forever()` is running in a different thread
otherwise it will deadlock.

`server_close()`

    
Clean up the server. May be overridden.

`address_family`

    
The family of protocols to which the server’s socket belongs. Common examples
are `socket.AF_INET` and `socket.AF_UNIX`.

`RequestHandlerClass`

    
The user-provided request handler class; an instance of this class is created
for each request.

`server_address`

    
The address on which the server is listening. The format of addresses varies
depending on the protocol family; see the documentation for the `socket`
module for details. For Internet protocols, this is a tuple containing a
string giving the address, and an integer port number: `('127.0.0.1', 80)`,
for example.

`socket`

    
The socket object on which the server will listen for incoming requests.

The server classes support the following class variables:

`allow_reuse_address`

    
Whether the server will allow the reuse of an address. This defaults to
`False`, and can be set in subclasses to change the policy.

`request_queue_size`

    
The size of the request queue. If it takes a long time to process a single
request, any requests that arrive while the server is busy are placed into a
queue, up to `request_queue_size` requests. Once the queue is full, further
requests from clients will get a “Connection denied” error. The default value
is usually 5, but this can be overridden by subclasses.

`socket_type`

    
The type of socket used by the server; `socket.SOCK_STREAM` and
`socket.SOCK_DGRAM` are two common values.

`timeout`

    
Timeout duration, measured in seconds, or `None` if no timeout is desired. If
`handle_request()` receives no incoming requests within the timeout period,
the `handle_timeout()` method is called.

There are various server methods that can be overridden by subclasses of base
server classes like `TCPServer`; these methods aren’t useful to external users
of the server object.

`finish_request(request, client_address)`

    
Actually processes the request by instantiating `RequestHandlerClass` and
calling its `handle()` method.

`get_request()`

    
Must accept a request from the socket, and return a 2-tuple containing the new
socket object to be used to communicate with the client, and the client’s
address.

`handle_error(request, client_address)`

    
This function is called if the `handle()` method of a `RequestHandlerClass`
instance raises an exception. The default action is to print the traceback to
standard error and continue handling further requests.

Changed in version 3.6: Now only called for exceptions derived from the
`Exception` class.

`handle_timeout()`

    
This function is called when the `timeout` attribute has been set to a value
other than `None` and the timeout period has passed with no requests being
received. The default action for forking servers is to collect the status of
any child processes that have exited, while in threading servers this method
does nothing.

`process_request(request, client_address)`

    
Calls `finish_request()` to create an instance of the `RequestHandlerClass`.
If desired, this function can create a new process or thread to handle the
request; the `ForkingMixIn` and `ThreadingMixIn` classes do this.

`server_activate()`

    
Called by the server’s constructor to activate the server. The default
behavior for a TCP server just invokes `listen()` on the server’s socket. May
be overridden.

`server_bind()`

    
Called by the server’s constructor to bind the socket to the desired address.
May be overridden.

`verify_request(request, client_address)`

    
Must return a Boolean value; if the value is `True`, the request will be
processed, and if it’s `False`, the request will be denied. This function can
be overridden to implement access controls for a server. The default
implementation always returns `True`.

Changed in version 3.6: Support for the context manager protocol was added.
Exiting the context manager is equivalent to calling `server_close()`.

## Request Handler Objects

`class socketserver.BaseRequestHandler`

    
This is the superclass of all request handler objects. It defines the
interface, given below. A concrete request handler subclass must define a new
`handle()` method, and can override any of the other methods. A new instance
of the subclass is created for each request.

`setup()`

    
Called before the `handle()` method to perform any initialization actions
required. The default implementation does nothing.

`handle()`

    
This function must do all the work required to service a request. The default
implementation does nothing. Several instance attributes are available to it;
the request is available as `self.request`; the client address as
`self.client_address`; and the server instance as `self.server`, in case it
needs access to per-server information.

The type of `self.request` is different for datagram or stream services. For
stream services, `self.request` is a socket object; for datagram services,
`self.request` is a pair of string and socket.

`finish()`

    
Called after the `handle()` method to perform any clean-up actions required.
The default implementation does nothing. If `setup()` raises an exception,
this function will not be called.

`class socketserver.StreamRequestHandler`

`class socketserver.DatagramRequestHandler`

    
These `BaseRequestHandler` subclasses override the `setup()` and `finish()`
methods, and provide `self.rfile` and `self.wfile` attributes. The
`self.rfile` and `self.wfile` attributes can be read or written, respectively,
to get the request data or return data to the client.

The `rfile` attributes of both classes support the `io.BufferedIOBase`
readable interface, and `DatagramRequestHandler.wfile` supports the
`io.BufferedIOBase` writable interface.

Changed in version 3.6: `StreamRequestHandler.wfile` also supports the
`io.BufferedIOBase` writable interface.

## Examples

###  `socketserver.TCPServer` Example

This is the server side:

    
    import socketserver
    
    class MyTCPHandler(socketserver.BaseRequestHandler):
        """
        The request handler class for our server.
    
        It is instantiated once per connection to the server, and must
        override the handle() method to implement communication to the
        client.
        """
    
        def handle(self):
            # self.request is the TCP socket connected to the client
            self.data = self.request.recv(1024).strip()
            print("{} wrote:".format(self.client_address[0]))
            print(self.data)
            # just send back the same data, but upper-cased
            self.request.sendall(self.data.upper())
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        HOST, PORT = "localhost", 9999
    
        # Create the server, binding to localhost on port 9999
        with socketserver.TCPServer((HOST, PORT), MyTCPHandler) as server:
            # Activate the server; this will keep running until you
            # interrupt the program with Ctrl-C
            server.serve_forever()
    
An alternative request handler class that makes use of streams (file-like
objects that simplify communication by providing the standard file interface):

    
    class MyTCPHandler(socketserver.StreamRequestHandler):
    
        def handle(self):
            # self.rfile is a file-like object created by the handler;
            # we can now use e.g. readline() instead of raw recv() calls
            self.data = self.rfile.readline().strip()
            print("{} wrote:".format(self.client_address[0]))
            print(self.data)
            # Likewise, self.wfile is a file-like object used to write back
            # to the client
            self.wfile.write(self.data.upper())
    
The difference is that the `readline()` call in the second handler will call
`recv()` multiple times until it encounters a newline character, while the
single `recv()` call in the first handler will just return what has been sent
from the client in one `sendall()` call.

This is the client side:

    
    import socket
    import sys
    
    HOST, PORT = "localhost", 9999
    data = " ".join(sys.argv[1:])
    
    # Create a socket (SOCK_STREAM means a TCP socket)
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
        # Connect to server and send data
        sock.connect((HOST, PORT))
        sock.sendall(bytes(data + "\n", "utf-8"))
    
        # Receive data from the server and shut down
        received = str(sock.recv(1024), "utf-8")
    
    print("Sent:     {}".format(data))
    print("Received: {}".format(received))
    
The output of the example should look something like this:

Server:

    
    $ python TCPServer.py
    127.0.0.1 wrote:
    b'hello world with TCP'
    127.0.0.1 wrote:
    b'python is nice'
    
Client:

    
    $ python TCPClient.py hello world with TCP
    Sent:     hello world with TCP
    Received: HELLO WORLD WITH TCP
    $ python TCPClient.py python is nice
    Sent:     python is nice
    Received: PYTHON IS NICE
    
###  `socketserver.UDPServer` Example

This is the server side:

    
    import socketserver
    
    class MyUDPHandler(socketserver.BaseRequestHandler):
        """
        This class works similar to the TCP handler class, except that
        self.request consists of a pair of data and client socket, and since
        there is no connection the client address must be given explicitly
        when sending data back via sendto().
        """
    
        def handle(self):
            data = self.request[0].strip()
            socket = self.request[1]
            print("{} wrote:".format(self.client_address[0]))
            print(data)
            socket.sendto(data.upper(), self.client_address)
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        HOST, PORT = "localhost", 9999
        with socketserver.UDPServer((HOST, PORT), MyUDPHandler) as server:
            server.serve_forever()
    
This is the client side:

    
    import socket
    import sys
    
    HOST, PORT = "localhost", 9999
    data = " ".join(sys.argv[1:])
    
    # SOCK_DGRAM is the socket type to use for UDP sockets
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    
    # As you can see, there is no connect() call; UDP has no connections.
    # Instead, data is directly sent to the recipient via sendto().
    sock.sendto(bytes(data + "\n", "utf-8"), (HOST, PORT))
    received = str(sock.recv(1024), "utf-8")
    
    print("Sent:     {}".format(data))
    print("Received: {}".format(received))
    
The output of the example should look exactly like for the TCP server example.

### Asynchronous Mixins

To build asynchronous handlers, use the `ThreadingMixIn` and `ForkingMixIn`
classes.

An example for the `ThreadingMixIn` class:

    
    import socket
    import threading
    import socketserver
    
    class ThreadedTCPRequestHandler(socketserver.BaseRequestHandler):
    
        def handle(self):
            data = str(self.request.recv(1024), 'ascii')
            cur_thread = threading.current_thread()
            response = bytes("{}: {}".format(cur_thread.name, data), 'ascii')
            self.request.sendall(response)
    
    class ThreadedTCPServer(socketserver.ThreadingMixIn, socketserver.TCPServer):
        pass
    
    def client(ip, port, message):
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
            sock.connect((ip, port))
            sock.sendall(bytes(message, 'ascii'))
            response = str(sock.recv(1024), 'ascii')
            print("Received: {}".format(response))
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Port 0 means to select an arbitrary unused port
        HOST, PORT = "localhost", 0
    
        server = ThreadedTCPServer((HOST, PORT), ThreadedTCPRequestHandler)
        with server:
            ip, port = server.server_address
    
            # Start a thread with the server -- that thread will then start one
            # more thread for each request
            server_thread = threading.Thread(target=server.serve_forever)
            # Exit the server thread when the main thread terminates
            server_thread.daemon = True
            server_thread.start()
            print("Server loop running in thread:", server_thread.name)
    
            client(ip, port, "Hello World 1")
            client(ip, port, "Hello World 2")
            client(ip, port, "Hello World 3")
    
            server.shutdown()
    
The output of the example should look something like this:

    
    $ python ThreadedTCPServer.py
    Server loop running in thread: Thread-1
    Received: Thread-2: Hello World 1
    Received: Thread-3: Hello World 2
    Received: Thread-4: Hello World 3
    
The `ForkingMixIn` class is used in the same way, except that the server will
spawn a new process for each request. Available only on POSIX platforms that
support `fork()`.
