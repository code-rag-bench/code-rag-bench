The following useful handlers are provided in the package. Note that three of
the handlers (`StreamHandler`, `FileHandler` and `NullHandler`) are actually
defined in the `logging` module itself, but have been documented here along
with the other handlers.

## StreamHandler

The `StreamHandler` class, located in the core `logging` package, sends
logging output to streams such as sys.stdout, sys.stderr or any file-like
object (or, more precisely, any object which supports `write()` and `flush()`
methods).

`class logging.StreamHandler(stream=None)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `StreamHandler` class. If stream is specified,
the instance will use it for logging output; otherwise, sys.stderr will be
used.

`emit(record)`

    
If a formatter is specified, it is used to format the record. The record is
then written to the stream followed by `terminator`. If exception information
is present, it is formatted using `traceback.print_exception()` and appended
to the stream.

`flush()`

    
Flushes the stream by calling its `flush()` method. Note that the `close()`
method is inherited from `Handler` and so does no output, so an explicit
`flush()` call may be needed at times.

`setStream(stream)`

    
Sets the instance’s stream to the specified value, if it is different. The old
stream is flushed before the new stream is set.

Parameters

    
stream – The stream that the handler should use.

Returns

    
the old stream, if the stream was changed, or None if it wasn’t.

New in version 3.7.

`terminator`

    
String used as the terminator when writing a formatted record to a stream.
Default value is `'\n'`.

If you don’t want a newline termination, you can set the handler instance’s
`terminator` attribute to the empty string.

In earlier versions, the terminator was hardcoded as `'\n'`.

New in version 3.2.

## FileHandler

The `FileHandler` class, located in the core `logging` package, sends logging
output to a disk file. It inherits the output functionality from
`StreamHandler`.

`class logging.FileHandler(filename, mode='a', encoding=None, delay=False,
errors=None)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `FileHandler` class. The specified file is
opened and used as the stream for logging. If mode is not specified, `'a'` is
used. If encoding is not `None`, it is used to open the file with that
encoding. If delay is true, then file opening is deferred until the first call
to `emit()`. By default, the file grows indefinitely. If errors is specified,
it’s used to determine how encoding errors are handled.

Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values, `Path` objects are also
accepted for the filename argument.

Changed in version 3.9: The errors parameter was added.

`close()`

    
Closes the file.

`emit(record)`

    
Outputs the record to the file.

## NullHandler

New in version 3.1.

The `NullHandler` class, located in the core `logging` package, does not do
any formatting or output. It is essentially a ‘no-op’ handler for use by
library developers.

`class logging.NullHandler`

    
Returns a new instance of the `NullHandler` class.

`emit(record)`

    
This method does nothing.

`handle(record)`

    
This method does nothing.

`createLock()`

    
This method returns `None` for the lock, since there is no underlying I/O to
which access needs to be serialized.

See Configuring Logging for a Library for more information on how to use
`NullHandler`.

## WatchedFileHandler

The `WatchedFileHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module, is a
`FileHandler` which watches the file it is logging to. If the file changes, it
is closed and reopened using the file name.

A file change can happen because of usage of programs such as newsyslog and
logrotate which perform log file rotation. This handler, intended for use
under Unix/Linux, watches the file to see if it has changed since the last
emit. (A file is deemed to have changed if its device or inode have changed.)
If the file has changed, the old file stream is closed, and the file opened to
get a new stream.

This handler is not appropriate for use under Windows, because under Windows
open log files cannot be moved or renamed - logging opens the files with
exclusive locks - and so there is no need for such a handler. Furthermore,
ST_INO is not supported under Windows; `stat()` always returns zero for this
value.

`class logging.handlers.WatchedFileHandler(filename, mode='a', encoding=None,
delay=False, errors=None)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `WatchedFileHandler` class. The specified file
is opened and used as the stream for logging. If mode is not specified, `'a'`
is used. If encoding is not `None`, it is used to open the file with that
encoding. If delay is true, then file opening is deferred until the first call
to `emit()`. By default, the file grows indefinitely. If errors is provided,
it determines how encoding errors are handled.

Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values, `Path` objects are also
accepted for the filename argument.

Changed in version 3.9: The errors parameter was added.

`reopenIfNeeded()`

    
Checks to see if the file has changed. If it has, the existing stream is
flushed and closed and the file opened again, typically as a precursor to
outputting the record to the file.

New in version 3.6.

`emit(record)`

    
Outputs the record to the file, but first calls `reopenIfNeeded()` to reopen
the file if it has changed.

## BaseRotatingHandler

The `BaseRotatingHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module, is
the base class for the rotating file handlers, `RotatingFileHandler` and
`TimedRotatingFileHandler`. You should not need to instantiate this class, but
it has attributes and methods you may need to override.

`class logging.handlers.BaseRotatingHandler(filename, mode, encoding=None,
delay=False, errors=None)`

    
The parameters are as for `FileHandler`. The attributes are:

`namer`

    
If this attribute is set to a callable, the `rotation_filename()` method
delegates to this callable. The parameters passed to the callable are those
passed to `rotation_filename()`.

Note

The namer function is called quite a few times during rollover, so it should
be as simple and as fast as possible. It should also return the same output
every time for a given input, otherwise the rollover behaviour may not work as
expected.

New in version 3.3.

`rotator`

    
If this attribute is set to a callable, the `rotate()` method delegates to
this callable. The parameters passed to the callable are those passed to
`rotate()`.

New in version 3.3.

`rotation_filename(default_name)`

    
Modify the filename of a log file when rotating.

This is provided so that a custom filename can be provided.

The default implementation calls the ‘namer’ attribute of the handler, if it’s
callable, passing the default name to it. If the attribute isn’t callable (the
default is `None`), the name is returned unchanged.

Parameters

    
default_name – The default name for the log file.

New in version 3.3.

`rotate(source, dest)`

    
When rotating, rotate the current log.

The default implementation calls the ‘rotator’ attribute of the handler, if
it’s callable, passing the source and dest arguments to it. If the attribute
isn’t callable (the default is `None`), the source is simply renamed to the
destination.

Parameters

    
  * source – The source filename. This is normally the base filename, e.g. ‘test.log’.
  * dest – The destination filename. This is normally what the source is rotated to, e.g. ‘test.log.1’.

New in version 3.3.

The reason the attributes exist is to save you having to subclass - you can
use the same callables for instances of `RotatingFileHandler` and
`TimedRotatingFileHandler`. If either the namer or rotator callable raises an
exception, this will be handled in the same way as any other exception during
an `emit()` call, i.e. via the `handleError()` method of the handler.

If you need to make more significant changes to rotation processing, you can
override the methods.

For an example, see Using a rotator and namer to customize log rotation
processing.

## RotatingFileHandler

The `RotatingFileHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module,
supports rotation of disk log files.

`class logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler(filename, mode='a', maxBytes=0,
backupCount=0, encoding=None, delay=False, errors=None)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `RotatingFileHandler` class. The specified file
is opened and used as the stream for logging. If mode is not specified, `'a'`
is used. If encoding is not `None`, it is used to open the file with that
encoding. If delay is true, then file opening is deferred until the first call
to `emit()`. By default, the file grows indefinitely. If errors is provided,
it determines how encoding errors are handled.

You can use the maxBytes and backupCount values to allow the file to rollover
at a predetermined size. When the size is about to be exceeded, the file is
closed and a new file is silently opened for output. Rollover occurs whenever
the current log file is nearly maxBytes in length; but if either of maxBytes
or backupCount is zero, rollover never occurs, so you generally want to set
backupCount to at least 1, and have a non-zero maxBytes. When backupCount is
non-zero, the system will save old log files by appending the extensions ‘.1’,
‘.2’ etc., to the filename. For example, with a backupCount of 5 and a base
file name of `app.log`, you would get `app.log`, `app.log.1`, `app.log.2`, up
to `app.log.5`. The file being written to is always `app.log`. When this file
is filled, it is closed and renamed to `app.log.1`, and if files `app.log.1`,
`app.log.2`, etc. exist, then they are renamed to `app.log.2`, `app.log.3`
etc. respectively.

Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values, `Path` objects are also
accepted for the filename argument.

Changed in version 3.9: The errors parameter was added.

`doRollover()`

    
Does a rollover, as described above.

`emit(record)`

    
Outputs the record to the file, catering for rollover as described previously.

## TimedRotatingFileHandler

The `TimedRotatingFileHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers`
module, supports rotation of disk log files at certain timed intervals.

`class logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler(filename, when='h',
interval=1, backupCount=0, encoding=None, delay=False, utc=False, atTime=None,
errors=None)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `TimedRotatingFileHandler` class. The specified
file is opened and used as the stream for logging. On rotating it also sets
the filename suffix. Rotating happens based on the product of when and
interval.

You can use the when to specify the type of interval. The list of possible
values is below. Note that they are not case sensitive.

Value | Type of interval | If/how atTime is used  
---|---|---  
`'S'` | Seconds | Ignored  
`'M'` | Minutes | Ignored  
`'H'` | Hours | Ignored  
`'D'` | Days | Ignored  
`'W0'-'W6'` | Weekday (0=Monday) | Used to compute initial rollover time  
`'midnight'` | Roll over at midnight, if atTime not specified, else at time atTime | Used to compute initial rollover time  
When using weekday-based rotation, specify ‘W0’ for Monday, ‘W1’ for Tuesday,
and so on up to ‘W6’ for Sunday. In this case, the value passed for interval
isn’t used.

The system will save old log files by appending extensions to the filename.
The extensions are date-and-time based, using the strftime format
`%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S` or a leading portion thereof, depending on the rollover
interval.

When computing the next rollover time for the first time (when the handler is
created), the last modification time of an existing log file, or else the
current time, is used to compute when the next rotation will occur.

If the utc argument is true, times in UTC will be used; otherwise local time
is used.

If backupCount is nonzero, at most backupCount files will be kept, and if more
would be created when rollover occurs, the oldest one is deleted. The deletion
logic uses the interval to determine which files to delete, so changing the
interval may leave old files lying around.

If delay is true, then file opening is deferred until the first call to
`emit()`.

If atTime is not `None`, it must be a `datetime.time` instance which specifies
the time of day when rollover occurs, for the cases where rollover is set to
happen “at midnight” or “on a particular weekday”. Note that in these cases,
the atTime value is effectively used to compute the initial rollover, and
subsequent rollovers would be calculated via the normal interval calculation.

If errors is specified, it’s used to determine how encoding errors are
handled.

Note

Calculation of the initial rollover time is done when the handler is
initialised. Calculation of subsequent rollover times is done only when
rollover occurs, and rollover occurs only when emitting output. If this is not
kept in mind, it might lead to some confusion. For example, if an interval of
“every minute” is set, that does not mean you will always see log files with
times (in the filename) separated by a minute; if, during application
execution, logging output is generated more frequently than once a minute,
then you can expect to see log files with times separated by a minute. If, on
the other hand, logging messages are only output once every five minutes
(say), then there will be gaps in the file times corresponding to the minutes
where no output (and hence no rollover) occurred.

Changed in version 3.4: atTime parameter was added.

Changed in version 3.6: As well as string values, `Path` objects are also
accepted for the filename argument.

Changed in version 3.9: The errors parameter was added.

`doRollover()`

    
Does a rollover, as described above.

`emit(record)`

    
Outputs the record to the file, catering for rollover as described above.

## SocketHandler

The `SocketHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module, sends
logging output to a network socket. The base class uses a TCP socket.

`class logging.handlers.SocketHandler(host, port)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `SocketHandler` class intended to communicate
with a remote machine whose address is given by host and port.

Changed in version 3.4: If `port` is specified as `None`, a Unix domain socket
is created using the value in `host` \- otherwise, a TCP socket is created.

`close()`

    
Closes the socket.

`emit()`

    
Pickles the record’s attribute dictionary and writes it to the socket in
binary format. If there is an error with the socket, silently drops the
packet. If the connection was previously lost, re-establishes the connection.
To unpickle the record at the receiving end into a `LogRecord`, use the
`makeLogRecord()` function.

`handleError()`

    
Handles an error which has occurred during `emit()`. The most likely cause is
a lost connection. Closes the socket so that we can retry on the next event.

`makeSocket()`

    
This is a factory method which allows subclasses to define the precise type of
socket they want. The default implementation creates a TCP socket
(`socket.SOCK_STREAM`).

`makePickle(record)`

    
Pickles the record’s attribute dictionary in binary format with a length
prefix, and returns it ready for transmission across the socket. The details
of this operation are equivalent to:

    
    data = pickle.dumps(record_attr_dict, 1)
    datalen = struct.pack('>L', len(data))
    return datalen + data
    
Note that pickles aren’t completely secure. If you are concerned about
security, you may want to override this method to implement a more secure
mechanism. For example, you can sign pickles using HMAC and then verify them
on the receiving end, or alternatively you can disable unpickling of global
objects on the receiving end.

`send(packet)`

    
Send a pickled byte-string packet to the socket. The format of the sent byte-
string is as described in the documentation for `makePickle()`.

This function allows for partial sends, which can happen when the network is
busy.

`createSocket()`

    
Tries to create a socket; on failure, uses an exponential back-off algorithm.
On initial failure, the handler will drop the message it was trying to send.
When subsequent messages are handled by the same instance, it will not try
connecting until some time has passed. The default parameters are such that
the initial delay is one second, and if after that delay the connection still
can’t be made, the handler will double the delay each time up to a maximum of
30 seconds.

This behaviour is controlled by the following handler attributes:

  * `retryStart` (initial delay, defaulting to 1.0 seconds).
  * `retryFactor` (multiplier, defaulting to 2.0).
  * `retryMax` (maximum delay, defaulting to 30.0 seconds).

This means that if the remote listener starts up after the handler has been
used, you could lose messages (since the handler won’t even attempt a
connection until the delay has elapsed, but just silently drop messages during
the delay period).

## DatagramHandler

The `DatagramHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module,
inherits from `SocketHandler` to support sending logging messages over UDP
sockets.

`class logging.handlers.DatagramHandler(host, port)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `DatagramHandler` class intended to communicate
with a remote machine whose address is given by host and port.

Changed in version 3.4: If `port` is specified as `None`, a Unix domain socket
is created using the value in `host` \- otherwise, a UDP socket is created.

`emit()`

    
Pickles the record’s attribute dictionary and writes it to the socket in
binary format. If there is an error with the socket, silently drops the
packet. To unpickle the record at the receiving end into a `LogRecord`, use
the `makeLogRecord()` function.

`makeSocket()`

    
The factory method of `SocketHandler` is here overridden to create a UDP
socket (`socket.SOCK_DGRAM`).

`send(s)`

    
Send a pickled byte-string to a socket. The format of the sent byte-string is
as described in the documentation for `SocketHandler.makePickle()`.

## SysLogHandler

The `SysLogHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module, supports
sending logging messages to a remote or local Unix syslog.

`class logging.handlers.SysLogHandler(address=('localhost', SYSLOG_UDP_PORT),
facility=LOG_USER, socktype=socket.SOCK_DGRAM)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `SysLogHandler` class intended to communicate
with a remote Unix machine whose address is given by address in the form of a
`(host, port)` tuple. If address is not specified, `('localhost', 514)` is
used. The address is used to open a socket. An alternative to providing a
`(host, port)` tuple is providing an address as a string, for example
‘/dev/log’. In this case, a Unix domain socket is used to send the message to
the syslog. If facility is not specified, `LOG_USER` is used. The type of
socket opened depends on the socktype argument, which defaults to
`socket.SOCK_DGRAM` and thus opens a UDP socket. To open a TCP socket (for use
with the newer syslog daemons such as rsyslog), specify a value of
`socket.SOCK_STREAM`.

Note that if your server is not listening on UDP port 514, `SysLogHandler` may
appear not to work. In that case, check what address you should be using for a
domain socket - it’s system dependent. For example, on Linux it’s usually
‘/dev/log’ but on OS/X it’s ‘/var/run/syslog’. You’ll need to check your
platform and use the appropriate address (you may need to do this check at
runtime if your application needs to run on several platforms). On Windows,
you pretty much have to use the UDP option.

Changed in version 3.2: socktype was added.

`close()`

    
Closes the socket to the remote host.

`emit(record)`

    
The record is formatted, and then sent to the syslog server. If exception
information is present, it is not sent to the server.

Changed in version 3.2.1: (See: bpo-12168.) In earlier versions, the message
sent to the syslog daemons was always terminated with a NUL byte, because
early versions of these daemons expected a NUL terminated message - even
though it’s not in the relevant specification (RFC 5424). More recent versions
of these daemons don’t expect the NUL byte but strip it off if it’s there, and
even more recent daemons (which adhere more closely to RFC 5424) pass the NUL
byte on as part of the message.

To enable easier handling of syslog messages in the face of all these
differing daemon behaviours, the appending of the NUL byte has been made
configurable, through the use of a class-level attribute, `append_nul`. This
defaults to `True` (preserving the existing behaviour) but can be set to
`False` on a `SysLogHandler` instance in order for that instance to not append
the NUL terminator.

Changed in version 3.3: (See: bpo-12419.) In earlier versions, there was no
facility for an “ident” or “tag” prefix to identify the source of the message.
This can now be specified using a class-level attribute, defaulting to `""` to
preserve existing behaviour, but which can be overridden on a `SysLogHandler`
instance in order for that instance to prepend the ident to every message
handled. Note that the provided ident must be text, not bytes, and is
prepended to the message exactly as is.

`encodePriority(facility, priority)`

    
Encodes the facility and priority into an integer. You can pass in strings or
integers - if strings are passed, internal mapping dictionaries are used to
convert them to integers.

The symbolic `LOG_` values are defined in `SysLogHandler` and mirror the
values defined in the `sys/syslog.h` header file.

Priorities

Name (string) | Symbolic value  
---|---  
`alert` | LOG_ALERT  
`crit` or `critical` | LOG_CRIT  
`debug` | LOG_DEBUG  
`emerg` or `panic` | LOG_EMERG  
`err` or `error` | LOG_ERR  
`info` | LOG_INFO  
`notice` | LOG_NOTICE  
`warn` or `warning` | LOG_WARNING  
Facilities

Name (string) | Symbolic value  
---|---  
`auth` | LOG_AUTH  
`authpriv` | LOG_AUTHPRIV  
`cron` | LOG_CRON  
`daemon` | LOG_DAEMON  
`ftp` | LOG_FTP  
`kern` | LOG_KERN  
`lpr` | LOG_LPR  
`mail` | LOG_MAIL  
`news` | LOG_NEWS  
`syslog` | LOG_SYSLOG  
`user` | LOG_USER  
`uucp` | LOG_UUCP  
`local0` | LOG_LOCAL0  
`local1` | LOG_LOCAL1  
`local2` | LOG_LOCAL2  
`local3` | LOG_LOCAL3  
`local4` | LOG_LOCAL4  
`local5` | LOG_LOCAL5  
`local6` | LOG_LOCAL6  
`local7` | LOG_LOCAL7  
`mapPriority(levelname)`

    
Maps a logging level name to a syslog priority name. You may need to override
this if you are using custom levels, or if the default algorithm is not
suitable for your needs. The default algorithm maps `DEBUG`, `INFO`,
`WARNING`, `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` to the equivalent syslog names, and all
other level names to ‘warning’.

## NTEventLogHandler

The `NTEventLogHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module,
supports sending logging messages to a local Windows NT, Windows 2000 or
Windows XP event log. Before you can use it, you need Mark Hammond’s Win32
extensions for Python installed.

`class logging.handlers.NTEventLogHandler(appname, dllname=None,
logtype='Application')`

    
Returns a new instance of the `NTEventLogHandler` class. The appname is used
to define the application name as it appears in the event log. An appropriate
registry entry is created using this name. The dllname should give the fully
qualified pathname of a .dll or .exe which contains message definitions to
hold in the log (if not specified, `'win32service.pyd'` is used - this is
installed with the Win32 extensions and contains some basic placeholder
message definitions. Note that use of these placeholders will make your event
logs big, as the entire message source is held in the log. If you want slimmer
logs, you have to pass in the name of your own .dll or .exe which contains the
message definitions you want to use in the event log). The logtype is one of
`'Application'`, `'System'` or `'Security'`, and defaults to `'Application'`.

`close()`

    
At this point, you can remove the application name from the registry as a
source of event log entries. However, if you do this, you will not be able to
see the events as you intended in the Event Log Viewer - it needs to be able
to access the registry to get the .dll name. The current version does not do
this.

`emit(record)`

    
Determines the message ID, event category and event type, and then logs the
message in the NT event log.

`getEventCategory(record)`

    
Returns the event category for the record. Override this if you want to
specify your own categories. This version returns 0.

`getEventType(record)`

    
Returns the event type for the record. Override this if you want to specify
your own types. This version does a mapping using the handler’s typemap
attribute, which is set up in `__init__()` to a dictionary which contains
mappings for `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` and `CRITICAL`. If you are
using your own levels, you will either need to override this method or place a
suitable dictionary in the handler’s typemap attribute.

`getMessageID(record)`

    
Returns the message ID for the record. If you are using your own messages, you
could do this by having the msg passed to the logger being an ID rather than a
format string. Then, in here, you could use a dictionary lookup to get the
message ID. This version returns 1, which is the base message ID in
`win32service.pyd`.

## SMTPHandler

The `SMTPHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module, supports
sending logging messages to an email address via SMTP.

`class logging.handlers.SMTPHandler(mailhost, fromaddr, toaddrs, subject,
credentials=None, secure=None, timeout=1.0)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `SMTPHandler` class. The instance is initialized
with the from and to addresses and subject line of the email. The toaddrs
should be a list of strings. To specify a non-standard SMTP port, use the
(host, port) tuple format for the mailhost argument. If you use a string, the
standard SMTP port is used. If your SMTP server requires authentication, you
can specify a (username, password) tuple for the credentials argument.

To specify the use of a secure protocol (TLS), pass in a tuple to the secure
argument. This will only be used when authentication credentials are supplied.
The tuple should be either an empty tuple, or a single-value tuple with the
name of a keyfile, or a 2-value tuple with the names of the keyfile and
certificate file. (This tuple is passed to the `smtplib.SMTP.starttls()`
method.)

A timeout can be specified for communication with the SMTP server using the
timeout argument.

New in version 3.3: The timeout argument was added.

`emit(record)`

    
Formats the record and sends it to the specified addressees.

`getSubject(record)`

    
If you want to specify a subject line which is record-dependent, override this
method.

## MemoryHandler

The `MemoryHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module, supports
buffering of logging records in memory, periodically flushing them to a target
handler. Flushing occurs whenever the buffer is full, or when an event of a
certain severity or greater is seen.

`MemoryHandler` is a subclass of the more general `BufferingHandler`, which is
an abstract class. This buffers logging records in memory. Whenever each
record is added to the buffer, a check is made by calling `shouldFlush()` to
see if the buffer should be flushed. If it should, then `flush()` is expected
to do the flushing.

`class logging.handlers.BufferingHandler(capacity)`

    
Initializes the handler with a buffer of the specified capacity. Here,
capacity means the number of logging records buffered.

`emit(record)`

    
Append the record to the buffer. If `shouldFlush()` returns true, call
`flush()` to process the buffer.

`flush()`

    
You can override this to implement custom flushing behavior. This version just
zaps the buffer to empty.

`shouldFlush(record)`

    
Return `True` if the buffer is up to capacity. This method can be overridden
to implement custom flushing strategies.

`class logging.handlers.MemoryHandler(capacity, flushLevel=ERROR, target=None,
flushOnClose=True)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `MemoryHandler` class. The instance is
initialized with a buffer size of capacity (number of records buffered). If
flushLevel is not specified, `ERROR` is used. If no target is specified, the
target will need to be set using `setTarget()` before this handler does
anything useful. If flushOnClose is specified as `False`, then the buffer is
not flushed when the handler is closed. If not specified or specified as
`True`, the previous behaviour of flushing the buffer will occur when the
handler is closed.

Changed in version 3.6: The flushOnClose parameter was added.

`close()`

    
Calls `flush()`, sets the target to `None` and clears the buffer.

`flush()`

    
For a `MemoryHandler`, flushing means just sending the buffered records to the
target, if there is one. The buffer is also cleared when this happens.
Override if you want different behavior.

`setTarget(target)`

    
Sets the target handler for this handler.

`shouldFlush(record)`

    
Checks for buffer full or a record at the flushLevel or higher.

## HTTPHandler

The `HTTPHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module, supports
sending logging messages to a Web server, using either `GET` or `POST`
semantics.

`class logging.handlers.HTTPHandler(host, url, method='GET', secure=False,
credentials=None, context=None)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `HTTPHandler` class. The host can be of the form
`host:port`, should you need to use a specific port number. If no method is
specified, `GET` is used. If secure is true, a HTTPS connection will be used.
The context parameter may be set to a `ssl.SSLContext` instance to configure
the SSL settings used for the HTTPS connection. If credentials is specified,
it should be a 2-tuple consisting of userid and password, which will be placed
in a HTTP ‘Authorization’ header using Basic authentication. If you specify
credentials, you should also specify secure=True so that your userid and
password are not passed in cleartext across the wire.

Changed in version 3.5: The context parameter was added.

`mapLogRecord(record)`

    
Provides a dictionary, based on `record`, which is to be URL-encoded and sent
to the web server. The default implementation just returns `record.__dict__`.
This method can be overridden if e.g. only a subset of `LogRecord` is to be
sent to the web server, or if more specific customization of what’s sent to
the server is required.

`emit(record)`

    
Sends the record to the Web server as a URL-encoded dictionary. The
`mapLogRecord()` method is used to convert the record to the dictionary to be
sent.

Note

Since preparing a record for sending it to a Web server is not the same as a
generic formatting operation, using `setFormatter()` to specify a `Formatter`
for a `HTTPHandler` has no effect. Instead of calling `format()`, this handler
calls `mapLogRecord()` and then `urllib.parse.urlencode()` to encode the
dictionary in a form suitable for sending to a Web server.

## QueueHandler

New in version 3.2.

The `QueueHandler` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module, supports
sending logging messages to a queue, such as those implemented in the `queue`
or `multiprocessing` modules.

Along with the `QueueListener` class, `QueueHandler` can be used to let
handlers do their work on a separate thread from the one which does the
logging. This is important in Web applications and also other service
applications where threads servicing clients need to respond as quickly as
possible, while any potentially slow operations (such as sending an email via
`SMTPHandler`) are done on a separate thread.

`class logging.handlers.QueueHandler(queue)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `QueueHandler` class. The instance is
initialized with the queue to send messages to. The queue can be any queue-
like object; it’s used as-is by the `enqueue()` method, which needs to know
how to send messages to it. The queue is not required to have the task
tracking API, which means that you can use `SimpleQueue` instances for queue.

`emit(record)`

    
Enqueues the result of preparing the LogRecord. Should an exception occur
(e.g. because a bounded queue has filled up), the `handleError()` method is
called to handle the error. This can result in the record silently being
dropped (if `logging.raiseExceptions` is `False`) or a message printed to
`sys.stderr` (if `logging.raiseExceptions` is `True`).

`prepare(record)`

    
Prepares a record for queuing. The object returned by this method is enqueued.

The base implementation formats the record to merge the message, arguments,
and exception information, if present. It also removes unpickleable items from
the record in-place.

You might want to override this method if you want to convert the record to a
dict or JSON string, or send a modified copy of the record while leaving the
original intact.

`enqueue(record)`

    
Enqueues the record on the queue using `put_nowait()`; you may want to
override this if you want to use blocking behaviour, or a timeout, or a
customized queue implementation.

## QueueListener

New in version 3.2.

The `QueueListener` class, located in the `logging.handlers` module, supports
receiving logging messages from a queue, such as those implemented in the
`queue` or `multiprocessing` modules. The messages are received from a queue
in an internal thread and passed, on the same thread, to one or more handlers
for processing. While `QueueListener` is not itself a handler, it is
documented here because it works hand-in-hand with `QueueHandler`.

Along with the `QueueHandler` class, `QueueListener` can be used to let
handlers do their work on a separate thread from the one which does the
logging. This is important in Web applications and also other service
applications where threads servicing clients need to respond as quickly as
possible, while any potentially slow operations (such as sending an email via
`SMTPHandler`) are done on a separate thread.

`class logging.handlers.QueueListener(queue, *handlers,
respect_handler_level=False)`

    
Returns a new instance of the `QueueListener` class. The instance is
initialized with the queue to send messages to and a list of handlers which
will handle entries placed on the queue. The queue can be any queue-like
object; it’s passed as-is to the `dequeue()` method, which needs to know how
to get messages from it. The queue is not required to have the task tracking
API (though it’s used if available), which means that you can use
`SimpleQueue` instances for queue.

If `respect_handler_level` is `True`, a handler’s level is respected (compared
with the level for the message) when deciding whether to pass messages to that
handler; otherwise, the behaviour is as in previous Python versions - to
always pass each message to each handler.

Changed in version 3.5: The `respect_handler_level` argument was added.

`dequeue(block)`

    
Dequeues a record and return it, optionally blocking.

The base implementation uses `get()`. You may want to override this method if
you want to use timeouts or work with custom queue implementations.

`prepare(record)`

    
Prepare a record for handling.

This implementation just returns the passed-in record. You may want to
override this method if you need to do any custom marshalling or manipulation
of the record before passing it to the handlers.

`handle(record)`

    
Handle a record.

This just loops through the handlers offering them the record to handle. The
actual object passed to the handlers is that which is returned from
`prepare()`.

`start()`

    
Starts the listener.

This starts up a background thread to monitor the queue for LogRecords to
process.

`stop()`

    
Stops the listener.

This asks the thread to terminate, and then waits for it to do so. Note that
if you don’t call this before your application exits, there may be some
records still left on the queue, which won’t be processed.

`enqueue_sentinel()`

    
Writes a sentinel to the queue to tell the listener to quit. This
implementation uses `put_nowait()`. You may want to override this method if
you want to use timeouts or work with custom queue implementations.

New in version 3.3.
