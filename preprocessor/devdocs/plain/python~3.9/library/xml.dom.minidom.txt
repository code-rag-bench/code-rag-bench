# xml.dom.minidom — Minimal DOM implementation

Source code: Lib/xml/dom/minidom.py

`xml.dom.minidom` is a minimal implementation of the Document Object Model
interface, with an API similar to that in other languages. It is intended to
be simpler than the full DOM and also significantly smaller. Users who are not
already proficient with the DOM should consider using the
`xml.etree.ElementTree` module for their XML processing instead.

Warning

The `xml.dom.minidom` module is not secure against maliciously constructed
data. If you need to parse untrusted or unauthenticated data see XML
vulnerabilities.

DOM applications typically start by parsing some XML into a DOM. With
`xml.dom.minidom`, this is done through the parse functions:

    
    from xml.dom.minidom import parse, parseString
    
    dom1 = parse('c:\\temp\\mydata.xml')  # parse an XML file by name
    
    datasource = open('c:\\temp\\mydata.xml')
    dom2 = parse(datasource)  # parse an open file
    
    dom3 = parseString('<myxml>Some data<empty/> some more data</myxml>')
    
The `parse()` function can take either a filename or an open file object.

`xml.dom.minidom.parse(filename_or_file, parser=None, bufsize=None)`

    
Return a `Document` from the given input. filename_or_file may be either a
file name, or a file-like object. parser, if given, must be a SAX2 parser
object. This function will change the document handler of the parser and
activate namespace support; other parser configuration (like setting an entity
resolver) must have been done in advance.

If you have XML in a string, you can use the `parseString()` function instead:

`xml.dom.minidom.parseString(string, parser=None)`

    
Return a `Document` that represents the string. This method creates an
`io.StringIO` object for the string and passes that on to `parse()`.

Both functions return a `Document` object representing the content of the
document.

What the `parse()` and `parseString()` functions do is connect an XML parser
with a “DOM builder” that can accept parse events from any SAX parser and
convert them into a DOM tree. The name of the functions are perhaps
misleading, but are easy to grasp when learning the interfaces. The parsing of
the document will be completed before these functions return; it’s simply that
these functions do not provide a parser implementation themselves.

You can also create a `Document` by calling a method on a “DOM Implementation”
object. You can get this object either by calling the `getDOMImplementation()`
function in the `xml.dom` package or the `xml.dom.minidom` module. Once you
have a `Document`, you can add child nodes to it to populate the DOM:

    
    from xml.dom.minidom import getDOMImplementation
    
    impl = getDOMImplementation()
    
    newdoc = impl.createDocument(None, "some_tag", None)
    top_element = newdoc.documentElement
    text = newdoc.createTextNode('Some textual content.')
    top_element.appendChild(text)
    
Once you have a DOM document object, you can access the parts of your XML
document through its properties and methods. These properties are defined in
the DOM specification. The main property of the document object is the
`documentElement` property. It gives you the main element in the XML document:
the one that holds all others. Here is an example program:

    
    dom3 = parseString("<myxml>Some data</myxml>")
    assert dom3.documentElement.tagName == "myxml"
    
When you are finished with a DOM tree, you may optionally call the `unlink()`
method to encourage early cleanup of the now-unneeded objects. `unlink()` is
an `xml.dom.minidom`-specific extension to the DOM API that renders the node
and its descendants are essentially useless. Otherwise, Python’s garbage
collector will eventually take care of the objects in the tree.

## DOM Objects

The definition of the DOM API for Python is given as part of the `xml.dom`
module documentation. This section lists the differences between the API and
`xml.dom.minidom`.

`Node.unlink()`

    
Break internal references within the DOM so that it will be garbage collected
on versions of Python without cyclic GC. Even when cyclic GC is available,
using this can make large amounts of memory available sooner, so calling this
on DOM objects as soon as they are no longer needed is good practice. This
only needs to be called on the `Document` object, but may be called on child
nodes to discard children of that node.

You can avoid calling this method explicitly by using the `with` statement.
The following code will automatically unlink dom when the `with` block is
exited:

    
    with xml.dom.minidom.parse(datasource) as dom:
        ... # Work with dom.
    
`Node.writexml(writer, indent="", addindent="", newl="", encoding=None,
standalone=None)`

    
Write XML to the writer object. The writer receives texts but not bytes as
input, it should have a `write()` method which matches that of the file object
interface. The indent parameter is the indentation of the current node. The
addindent parameter is the incremental indentation to use for subnodes of the
current one. The newl parameter specifies the string to use to terminate
newlines.

For the `Document` node, an additional keyword argument encoding can be used
to specify the encoding field of the XML header.

Silimarly, explicitly stating the standalone argument causes the standalone
document declarations to be added to the prologue of the XML document. If the
value is set to `True`, `standalone=”yes”` is added, otherwise it is set to
`“no”`. Not stating the argument will omit the declaration from the document.

Changed in version 3.8: The `writexml()` method now preserves the attribute
order specified by the user.

`Node.toxml(encoding=None, standalone=None)`

    
Return a string or byte string containing the XML represented by the DOM node.

With an explicit encoding 1 argument, the result is a byte string in the
specified encoding. With no encoding argument, the result is a Unicode string,
and the XML declaration in the resulting string does not specify an encoding.
Encoding this string in an encoding other than UTF-8 is likely incorrect,
since UTF-8 is the default encoding of XML.

The standalone argument behaves exactly as in `writexml()`.

Changed in version 3.8: The `toxml()` method now preserves the attribute order
specified by the user.

`Node.toprettyxml(indent="\t", newl="\n", encoding=None, standalone=None)`

    
Return a pretty-printed version of the document. indent specifies the
indentation string and defaults to a tabulator; newl specifies the string
emitted at the end of each line and defaults to `\n`.

The encoding argument behaves like the corresponding argument of `toxml()`.

The standalone argument behaves exactly as in `writexml()`.

Changed in version 3.8: The `toprettyxml()` method now preserves the attribute
order specified by the user.

## DOM Example

This example program is a fairly realistic example of a simple program. In
this particular case, we do not take much advantage of the flexibility of the
DOM.

    
    import xml.dom.minidom
    
    document = """\
    <slideshow>
    <title>Demo slideshow</title>
    <slide><title>Slide title</title>
    <point>This is a demo</point>
    <point>Of a program for processing slides</point>
    </slide>
    
    <slide><title>Another demo slide</title>
    <point>It is important</point>
    <point>To have more than</point>
    <point>one slide</point>
    </slide>
    </slideshow>
    """
    
    dom = xml.dom.minidom.parseString(document)
    
    def getText(nodelist):
        rc = []
        for node in nodelist:
            if node.nodeType == node.TEXT_NODE:
                rc.append(node.data)
        return ''.join(rc)
    
    def handleSlideshow(slideshow):
        print("<html>")
        handleSlideshowTitle(slideshow.getElementsByTagName("title")[0])
        slides = slideshow.getElementsByTagName("slide")
        handleToc(slides)
        handleSlides(slides)
        print("</html>")
    
    def handleSlides(slides):
        for slide in slides:
            handleSlide(slide)
    
    def handleSlide(slide):
        handleSlideTitle(slide.getElementsByTagName("title")[0])
        handlePoints(slide.getElementsByTagName("point"))
    
    def handleSlideshowTitle(title):
        print("<title>%s</title>" % getText(title.childNodes))
    
    def handleSlideTitle(title):
        print("<h2>%s</h2>" % getText(title.childNodes))
    
    def handlePoints(points):
        print("<ul>")
        for point in points:
            handlePoint(point)
        print("</ul>")
    
    def handlePoint(point):
        print("<li>%s</li>" % getText(point.childNodes))
    
    def handleToc(slides):
        for slide in slides:
            title = slide.getElementsByTagName("title")[0]
            print("<p>%s</p>" % getText(title.childNodes))
    
    handleSlideshow(dom)
    
## minidom and the DOM standard

The `xml.dom.minidom` module is essentially a DOM 1.0-compatible DOM with some
DOM 2 features (primarily namespace features).

Usage of the DOM interface in Python is straight-forward. The following
mapping rules apply:

  * Interfaces are accessed through instance objects. Applications should not instantiate the classes themselves; they should use the creator functions available on the `Document` object. Derived interfaces support all operations (and attributes) from the base interfaces, plus any new operations.
  * Operations are used as methods. Since the DOM uses only `in` parameters, the arguments are passed in normal order (from left to right). There are no optional arguments. `void` operations return `None`.
  * IDL attributes map to instance attributes. For compatibility with the OMG IDL language mapping for Python, an attribute `foo` can also be accessed through accessor methods `_get_foo()` and `_set_foo()`. `readonly` attributes must not be changed; this is not enforced at runtime.
  * The types `short int`, `unsigned int`, `unsigned long long`, and `boolean` all map to Python integer objects.
  * The type `DOMString` maps to Python strings. `xml.dom.minidom` supports either bytes or strings, but will normally produce strings. Values of type `DOMString` may also be `None` where allowed to have the IDL `null` value by the DOM specification from the W3C.
  * `const` declarations map to variables in their respective scope (e.g. `xml.dom.minidom.Node.PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION_NODE`); they must not be changed.
  * `DOMException` is currently not supported in `xml.dom.minidom`. Instead, `xml.dom.minidom` uses standard Python exceptions such as `TypeError` and `AttributeError`.
  * `NodeList` objects are implemented using Python’s built-in list type. These objects provide the interface defined in the DOM specification, but with earlier versions of Python they do not support the official API. They are, however, much more “Pythonic” than the interface defined in the W3C recommendations.

The following interfaces have no implementation in `xml.dom.minidom`:

  * `DOMTimeStamp`
  * `EntityReference`

Most of these reflect information in the XML document that is not of general
utility to most DOM users.

The encoding name included in the XML output should conform to the appropriate
standards. For example, “UTF-8” is valid, but “UTF8” is not valid in an XML
document’s declaration, even though Python accepts it as an encoding name. See
