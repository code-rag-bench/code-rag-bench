# pipes — Interface to shell pipelines

Source code: Lib/pipes.py

The `pipes` module defines a class to abstract the concept of a pipeline — a
sequence of converters from one file to another.

Because the module uses /bin/sh command lines, a POSIX or compatible shell for
`os.system()` and `os.popen()` is required.

The `pipes` module defines the following class:

`class pipes.Template`

    
An abstraction of a pipeline.

Example:

    
    >>> import pipes
    >>> t = pipes.Template()
    >>> t.append('tr a-z A-Z', '--')
    >>> f = t.open('pipefile', 'w')
    >>> f.write('hello world')
    >>> f.close()
    >>> open('pipefile').read()
    'HELLO WORLD'
    
## Template Objects

Template objects following methods:

`Template.reset()`

    
Restore a pipeline template to its initial state.

`Template.clone()`

    
Return a new, equivalent, pipeline template.

`Template.debug(flag)`

    
If flag is true, turn debugging on. Otherwise, turn debugging off. When
debugging is on, commands to be executed are printed, and the shell is given
`set -x` command to be more verbose.

`Template.append(cmd, kind)`

    
Append a new action at the end. The cmd variable must be a valid bourne shell
command. The kind variable consists of two letters.

The first letter can be either of `'-'` (which means the command reads its
standard input), `'f'` (which means the commands reads a given file on the
command line) or `'.'` (which means the commands reads no input, and hence
must be first.)

Similarly, the second letter can be either of `'-'` (which means the command
writes to standard output), `'f'` (which means the command writes a file on
the command line) or `'.'` (which means the command does not write anything,
and hence must be last.)

`Template.prepend(cmd, kind)`

    
Add a new action at the beginning. See `append()` for explanations of the
arguments.

`Template.open(file, mode)`

    
Return a file-like object, open to file, but read from or written to by the
pipeline. Note that only one of `'r'`, `'w'` may be given.

`Template.copy(infile, outfile)`

    
Copy infile to outfile through the pipe.
