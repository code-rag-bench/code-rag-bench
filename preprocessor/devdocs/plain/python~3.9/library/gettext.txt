# gettext — Multilingual internationalization services

Source code: Lib/gettext.py

The `gettext` module provides internationalization (I18N) and localization
(L10N) services for your Python modules and applications. It supports both the
GNU gettext message catalog API and a higher level, class-based API that may
be more appropriate for Python files. The interface described below allows you
to write your module and application messages in one natural language, and
provide a catalog of translated messages for running under different natural
languages.

Some hints on localizing your Python modules and applications are also given.

## GNU gettext API

The `gettext` module defines the following API, which is very similar to the
GNU gettext API. If you use this API you will affect the translation of your
entire application globally. Often this is what you want if your application
is monolingual, with the choice of language dependent on the locale of your
user. If you are localizing a Python module, or if your application needs to
switch languages on the fly, you probably want to use the class-based API
instead.

`gettext.bindtextdomain(domain, localedir=None)`

    
Bind the domain to the locale directory localedir. More concretely, `gettext`
will look for binary `.mo` files for the given domain using the path (on
Unix): `localedir/language/LC_MESSAGES/domain.mo`, where language is searched
for in the environment variables `LANGUAGE`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES`, and
`LANG` respectively.

If localedir is omitted or `None`, then the current binding for domain is
returned. 1

`gettext.bind_textdomain_codeset(domain, codeset=None)`

    
Bind the domain to codeset, changing the encoding of byte strings returned by
the `lgettext()`, `ldgettext()`, `lngettext()` and `ldngettext()` functions.
If codeset is omitted, then the current binding is returned.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10.

`gettext.textdomain(domain=None)`

    
Change or query the current global domain. If domain is `None`, then the
current global domain is returned, otherwise the global domain is set to
domain, which is returned.

`gettext.gettext(message)`

    
Return the localized translation of message, based on the current global
domain, language, and locale directory. This function is usually aliased as
`_()` in the local namespace (see examples below).

`gettext.dgettext(domain, message)`

    
Like `gettext()`, but look the message up in the specified domain.

`gettext.ngettext(singular, plural, n)`

    
Like `gettext()`, but consider plural forms. If a translation is found, apply
the plural formula to n, and return the resulting message (some languages have
more than two plural forms). If no translation is found, return singular if n
is 1; return plural otherwise.

The Plural formula is taken from the catalog header. It is a C or Python
expression that has a free variable n; the expression evaluates to the index
of the plural in the catalog. See the GNU gettext documentation for the
precise syntax to be used in `.po` files and the formulas for a variety of
languages.

`gettext.dngettext(domain, singular, plural, n)`

    
Like `ngettext()`, but look the message up in the specified domain.

`gettext.pgettext(context, message)`

`gettext.dpgettext(domain, context, message)`

`gettext.npgettext(context, singular, plural, n)`

`gettext.dnpgettext(domain, context, singular, plural, n)`

    
Similar to the corresponding functions without the `p` in the prefix (that is,
`gettext()`, `dgettext()`, `ngettext()`, `dngettext()`), but the translation
is restricted to the given message context.

New in version 3.8.

`gettext.lgettext(message)`

`gettext.ldgettext(domain, message)`

`gettext.lngettext(singular, plural, n)`

`gettext.ldngettext(domain, singular, plural, n)`

    
Equivalent to the corresponding functions without the `l` prefix (`gettext()`,
`dgettext()`, `ngettext()` and `dngettext()`), but the translation is returned
as a byte string encoded in the preferred system encoding if no other encoding
was explicitly set with `bind_textdomain_codeset()`.

Warning

These functions should be avoided in Python 3, because they return encoded
bytes. It’s much better to use alternatives which return Unicode strings
instead, since most Python applications will want to manipulate human readable
text as strings instead of bytes. Further, it’s possible that you may get
unexpected Unicode-related exceptions if there are encoding problems with the
translated strings.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10.

Note that GNU gettext also defines a `dcgettext()` method, but this was deemed
not useful and so it is currently unimplemented.

Here’s an example of typical usage for this API:

    
    import gettext
    gettext.bindtextdomain('myapplication', '/path/to/my/language/directory')
    gettext.textdomain('myapplication')
    _ = gettext.gettext
    # ...
    print(_('This is a translatable string.'))
    
## Class-based API

The class-based API of the `gettext` module gives you more flexibility and
greater convenience than the GNU gettext API. It is the recommended way of
localizing your Python applications and modules. `gettext` defines a
`GNUTranslations` class which implements the parsing of GNU `.mo` format
files, and has methods for returning strings. Instances of this class can also
install themselves in the built-in namespace as the function `_()`.

`gettext.find(domain, localedir=None, languages=None, all=False)`

    
This function implements the standard `.mo` file search algorithm. It takes a
domain, identical to what `textdomain()` takes. Optional localedir is as in
`bindtextdomain()`. Optional languages is a list of strings, where each string
is a language code.

If localedir is not given, then the default system locale directory is used. 2
If languages is not given, then the following environment variables are
searched: `LANGUAGE`, `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES`, and `LANG`. The first one
returning a non-empty value is used for the languages variable. The
environment variables should contain a colon separated list of languages,
which will be split on the colon to produce the expected list of language code
strings.

`find()` then expands and normalizes the languages, and then iterates through
them, searching for an existing file built of these components:

`localedir/language/LC_MESSAGES/domain.mo`

The first such file name that exists is returned by `find()`. If no such file
is found, then `None` is returned. If all is given, it returns a list of all
file names, in the order in which they appear in the languages list or the
environment variables.

`gettext.translation(domain, localedir=None, languages=None, class_=None,
fallback=False, codeset=None)`

    
Return a `*Translations` instance based on the domain, localedir, and
languages, which are first passed to `find()` to get a list of the associated
`.mo` file paths. Instances with identical `.mo` file names are cached. The
actual class instantiated is class_ if provided, otherwise `GNUTranslations`.
The class’s constructor must take a single file object argument. If provided,
codeset will change the charset used to encode translated strings in the
`lgettext()` and `lngettext()` methods.

If multiple files are found, later files are used as fallbacks for earlier
ones. To allow setting the fallback, `copy.copy()` is used to clone each
translation object from the cache; the actual instance data is still shared
with the cache.

If no `.mo` file is found, this function raises `OSError` if fallback is false
(which is the default), and returns a `NullTranslations` instance if fallback
is true.

Changed in version 3.3: `IOError` used to be raised instead of `OSError`.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The codeset
parameter.

`gettext.install(domain, localedir=None, codeset=None, names=None)`

    
This installs the function `_()` in Python’s builtins namespace, based on
domain, localedir, and codeset which are passed to the function
`translation()`.

For the names parameter, please see the description of the translation
object’s `install()` method.

As seen below, you usually mark the strings in your application that are
candidates for translation, by wrapping them in a call to the `_()` function,
like this:

    
    print(_('This string will be translated.'))
    
For convenience, you want the `_()` function to be installed in Python’s
builtins namespace, so it is easily accessible in all modules of your
application.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The codeset
parameter.

### The `NullTranslations` class

Translation classes are what actually implement the translation of original
source file message strings to translated message strings. The base class used
by all translation classes is `NullTranslations`; this provides the basic
interface you can use to write your own specialized translation classes. Here
are the methods of `NullTranslations`:

`class gettext.NullTranslations(fp=None)`

    
Takes an optional file object fp, which is ignored by the base class.
Initializes “protected” instance variables _info and _charset which are set by
derived classes, as well as _fallback, which is set through `add_fallback()`.
It then calls `self._parse(fp)` if fp is not `None`.

`_parse(fp)`

    
No-op in the base class, this method takes file object fp, and reads the data
from the file, initializing its message catalog. If you have an unsupported
message catalog file format, you should override this method to parse your
format.

`add_fallback(fallback)`

    
Add fallback as the fallback object for the current translation object. A
translation object should consult the fallback if it cannot provide a
translation for a given message.

`gettext(message)`

    
If a fallback has been set, forward `gettext()` to the fallback. Otherwise,
return message. Overridden in derived classes.

`ngettext(singular, plural, n)`

    
If a fallback has been set, forward `ngettext()` to the fallback. Otherwise,
return singular if n is 1; return plural otherwise. Overridden in derived
classes.

`pgettext(context, message)`

    
If a fallback has been set, forward `pgettext()` to the fallback. Otherwise,
return the translated message. Overridden in derived classes.

New in version 3.8.

`npgettext(context, singular, plural, n)`

    
If a fallback has been set, forward `npgettext()` to the fallback. Otherwise,
return the translated message. Overridden in derived classes.

New in version 3.8.

`lgettext(message)`

`lngettext(singular, plural, n)`

    
Equivalent to `gettext()` and `ngettext()`, but the translation is returned as
a byte string encoded in the preferred system encoding if no encoding was
explicitly set with `set_output_charset()`. Overridden in derived classes.

Warning

These methods should be avoided in Python 3. See the warning for the
`lgettext()` function.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10.

`info()`

    
Return the “protected” `_info` variable, a dictionary containing the metadata
found in the message catalog file.

`charset()`

    
Return the encoding of the message catalog file.

`output_charset()`

    
Return the encoding used to return translated messages in `lgettext()` and
`lngettext()`.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10.

`set_output_charset(charset)`

    
Change the encoding used to return translated messages.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10.

`install(names=None)`

    
This method installs `gettext()` into the built-in namespace, binding it to
`_`.

If the names parameter is given, it must be a sequence containing the names of
functions you want to install in the builtins namespace in addition to `_()`.
Supported names are `'gettext'`, `'ngettext'`, `'pgettext'`, `'npgettext'`,
`'lgettext'`, and `'lngettext'`.

Note that this is only one way, albeit the most convenient way, to make the
`_()` function available to your application. Because it affects the entire
application globally, and specifically the built-in namespace, localized
modules should never install `_()`. Instead, they should use this code to make
`_()` available to their module:

    
    import gettext
    t = gettext.translation('mymodule', ...)
    _ = t.gettext
    
This puts `_()` only in the module’s global namespace and so only affects
calls within this module.

Changed in version 3.8: Added `'pgettext'` and `'npgettext'`.

### The `GNUTranslations` class

The `gettext` module provides one additional class derived from
`NullTranslations`: `GNUTranslations`. This class overrides `_parse()` to
enable reading GNU gettext format `.mo` files in both big-endian and little-
endian format.

`GNUTranslations` parses optional metadata out of the translation catalog. It
is convention with GNU gettext to include metadata as the translation for the
empty string. This metadata is in RFC 822-style `key: value` pairs, and should
contain the `Project-Id-Version` key. If the key `Content-Type` is found, then
the `charset` property is used to initialize the “protected” `_charset`
instance variable, defaulting to `None` if not found. If the charset encoding
is specified, then all message ids and message strings read from the catalog
are converted to Unicode using this encoding, else ASCII is assumed.

Since message ids are read as Unicode strings too, all `*gettext()` methods
will assume message ids as Unicode strings, not byte strings.

The entire set of key/value pairs are placed into a dictionary and set as the
“protected” `_info` instance variable.

If the `.mo` file’s magic number is invalid, the major version number is
unexpected, or if other problems occur while reading the file, instantiating a
`GNUTranslations` class can raise `OSError`.

`class gettext.GNUTranslations`

    
The following methods are overridden from the base class implementation:

`gettext(message)`

    
Look up the message id in the catalog and return the corresponding message
string, as a Unicode string. If there is no entry in the catalog for the
message id, and a fallback has been set, the look up is forwarded to the
fallback’s `gettext()` method. Otherwise, the message id is returned.

`ngettext(singular, plural, n)`

    
Do a plural-forms lookup of a message id. singular is used as the message id
for purposes of lookup in the catalog, while n is used to determine which
plural form to use. The returned message string is a Unicode string.

If the message id is not found in the catalog, and a fallback is specified,
the request is forwarded to the fallback’s `ngettext()` method. Otherwise,
when n is 1 singular is returned, and plural is returned in all other cases.

Here is an example:

    
    n = len(os.listdir('.'))
    cat = GNUTranslations(somefile)
    message = cat.ngettext(
        'There is %(num)d file in this directory',
        'There are %(num)d files in this directory',
        n) % {'num': n}
    
`pgettext(context, message)`

    
Look up the context and message id in the catalog and return the corresponding
message string, as a Unicode string. If there is no entry in the catalog for
the message id and context, and a fallback has been set, the look up is
forwarded to the fallback’s `pgettext()` method. Otherwise, the message id is
returned.

New in version 3.8.

`npgettext(context, singular, plural, n)`

    
Do a plural-forms lookup of a message id. singular is used as the message id
for purposes of lookup in the catalog, while n is used to determine which
plural form to use.

If the message id for context is not found in the catalog, and a fallback is
specified, the request is forwarded to the fallback’s `npgettext()` method.
Otherwise, when n is 1 singular is returned, and plural is returned in all
other cases.

New in version 3.8.

`lgettext(message)`

`lngettext(singular, plural, n)`

    
Equivalent to `gettext()` and `ngettext()`, but the translation is returned as
a byte string encoded in the preferred system encoding if no encoding was
explicitly set with `set_output_charset()`.

Warning

These methods should be avoided in Python 3. See the warning for the
`lgettext()` function.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10.

### Solaris message catalog support

The Solaris operating system defines its own binary `.mo` file format, but
since no documentation can be found on this format, it is not supported at
this time.

### The Catalog constructor

GNOME uses a version of the `gettext` module by James Henstridge, but this
version has a slightly different API. Its documented usage was:

    
    import gettext
    cat = gettext.Catalog(domain, localedir)
    _ = cat.gettext
    print(_('hello world'))
    
For compatibility with this older module, the function `Catalog()` is an alias
for the `translation()` function described above.

One difference between this module and Henstridge’s: his catalog objects
supported access through a mapping API, but this appears to be unused and so
is not currently supported.

## Internationalizing your programs and modules

Internationalization (I18N) refers to the operation by which a program is made
aware of multiple languages. Localization (L10N) refers to the adaptation of
your program, once internationalized, to the local language and cultural
habits. In order to provide multilingual messages for your Python programs,
you need to take the following steps:

  1. prepare your program or module by specially marking translatable strings
  2. run a suite of tools over your marked files to generate raw messages catalogs
  3. create language-specific translations of the message catalogs
  4. use the `gettext` module so that message strings are properly translated

In order to prepare your code for I18N, you need to look at all the strings in
your files. Any string that needs to be translated should be marked by
wrapping it in `_('...')` — that is, a call to the function `_()`. For
example:

    
    filename = 'mylog.txt'
    message = _('writing a log message')
    with open(filename, 'w') as fp:
        fp.write(message)
    
In this example, the string `'writing a log message'` is marked as a candidate
for translation, while the strings `'mylog.txt'` and `'w'` are not.

There are a few tools to extract the strings meant for translation. The
original GNU gettext only supported C or C++ source code but its extended
version xgettext scans code written in a number of languages, including
Python, to find strings marked as translatable. Babel is a Python
internationalization library that includes a `pybabel` script to extract and
compile message catalogs. François Pinard’s program called xpot does a similar
job and is available as part of his po-utils package.

(Python also includes pure-Python versions of these programs, called
pygettext.py and msgfmt.py; some Python distributions will install them for
you. pygettext.py is similar to xgettext, but only understands Python source
code and cannot handle other programming languages such as C or C++.
pygettext.py supports a command-line interface similar to xgettext; for
details on its use, run `pygettext.py --help`. msgfmt.py is binary compatible
with GNU msgfmt. With these two programs, you may not need the GNU gettext
package to internationalize your Python applications.)

xgettext, pygettext, and similar tools generate `.po` files that are message
catalogs. They are structured human-readable files that contain every marked
string in the source code, along with a placeholder for the translated
versions of these strings.

Copies of these `.po` files are then handed over to the individual human
translators who write translations for every supported natural language. They
send back the completed language-specific versions as a `<language-name>.po`
file that’s compiled into a machine-readable `.mo` binary catalog file using
the msgfmt program. The `.mo` files are used by the `gettext` module for the
actual translation processing at run-time.

How you use the `gettext` module in your code depends on whether you are
internationalizing a single module or your entire application. The next two
sections will discuss each case.

### Localizing your module

If you are localizing your module, you must take care not to make global
changes, e.g. to the built-in namespace. You should not use the GNU gettext
API but instead the class-based API.

Let’s say your module is called “spam” and the module’s various natural
language translation `.mo` files reside in `/usr/share/locale` in GNU gettext
format. Here’s what you would put at the top of your module:

    
    import gettext
    t = gettext.translation('spam', '/usr/share/locale')
    _ = t.gettext
    
### Localizing your application

If you are localizing your application, you can install the `_()` function
globally into the built-in namespace, usually in the main driver file of your
application. This will let all your application-specific files just use
`_('...')` without having to explicitly install it in each file.

In the simple case then, you need only add the following bit of code to the
main driver file of your application:

    
    import gettext
    gettext.install('myapplication')
    
If you need to set the locale directory, you can pass it into the `install()`
function:

    
    import gettext
    gettext.install('myapplication', '/usr/share/locale')
    
### Changing languages on the fly

If your program needs to support many languages at the same time, you may want
to create multiple translation instances and then switch between them
explicitly, like so:

    
    import gettext
    
    lang1 = gettext.translation('myapplication', languages=['en'])
    lang2 = gettext.translation('myapplication', languages=['fr'])
    lang3 = gettext.translation('myapplication', languages=['de'])
    
    # start by using language1
    lang1.install()
    
    # ... time goes by, user selects language 2
    lang2.install()
    
    # ... more time goes by, user selects language 3
    lang3.install()
    
### Deferred translations

In most coding situations, strings are translated where they are coded.
Occasionally however, you need to mark strings for translation, but defer
actual translation until later. A classic example is:

    
    animals = ['mollusk',
               'albatross',
               'rat',
               'penguin',
               'python', ]
    # ...
    for a in animals:
        print(a)
    
Here, you want to mark the strings in the `animals` list as being
translatable, but you don’t actually want to translate them until they are
printed.

Here is one way you can handle this situation:

    
    def _(message): return message
    
    animals = [_('mollusk'),
               _('albatross'),
               _('rat'),
               _('penguin'),
               _('python'), ]
    
    del _
    
    # ...
    for a in animals:
        print(_(a))
    
This works because the dummy definition of `_()` simply returns the string
unchanged. And this dummy definition will temporarily override any definition
of `_()` in the built-in namespace (until the `del` command). Take care,
though if you have a previous definition of `_()` in the local namespace.

Note that the second use of `_()` will not identify “a” as being translatable
to the gettext program, because the parameter is not a string literal.

Another way to handle this is with the following example:

    
    def N_(message): return message
    
    animals = [N_('mollusk'),
               N_('albatross'),
               N_('rat'),
               N_('penguin'),
               N_('python'), ]
    
    # ...
    for a in animals:
        print(_(a))
    
In this case, you are marking translatable strings with the function `N_()`,
which won’t conflict with any definition of `_()`. However, you will need to
teach your message extraction program to look for translatable strings marked
with `N_()`. xgettext, pygettext, `pybabel extract`, and xpot all support this
through the use of the `-k` command-line switch. The choice of `N_()` here is
totally arbitrary; it could have just as easily been
`MarkThisStringForTranslation()`.

#### Footnotes

`1`

    
The default locale directory is system dependent; for example, on RedHat Linux
it is `/usr/share/locale`, but on Solaris it is `/usr/lib/locale`. The
`gettext` module does not try to support these system dependent defaults;
instead its default is `sys.base_prefix/share/locale` (see `sys.base_prefix`).
For this reason, it is always best to call `bindtextdomain()` with an explicit
absolute path at the start of your application.
