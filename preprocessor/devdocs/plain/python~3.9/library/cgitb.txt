# cgitb — Traceback manager for CGI scripts

Source code: Lib/cgitb.py

The `cgitb` module provides a special exception handler for Python scripts.
(Its name is a bit misleading. It was originally designed to display extensive
traceback information in HTML for CGI scripts. It was later generalized to
also display this information in plain text.) After this module is activated,
if an uncaught exception occurs, a detailed, formatted report will be
displayed. The report includes a traceback showing excerpts of the source code
for each level, as well as the values of the arguments and local variables to
currently running functions, to help you debug the problem. Optionally, you
can save this information to a file instead of sending it to the browser.

To enable this feature, simply add this to the top of your CGI script:

    
    import cgitb
    cgitb.enable()
    
The options to the `enable()` function control whether the report is displayed
in the browser and whether the report is logged to a file for later analysis.

`cgitb.enable(display=1, logdir=None, context=5, format="html")`

    
This function causes the `cgitb` module to take over the interpreter’s default
handling for exceptions by setting the value of `sys.excepthook`.

The optional argument display defaults to `1` and can be set to `0` to
suppress sending the traceback to the browser. If the argument logdir is
present, the traceback reports are written to files. The value of logdir
should be a directory where these files will be placed. The optional argument
context is the number of lines of context to display around the current line
of source code in the traceback; this defaults to `5`. If the optional
argument format is `"html"`, the output is formatted as HTML. Any other value
forces plain text output. The default value is `"html"`.

`cgitb.text(info, context=5)`

    
This function handles the exception described by info (a 3-tuple containing
the result of `sys.exc_info()`), formatting its traceback as text and
returning the result as a string. The optional argument context is the number
of lines of context to display around the current line of source code in the
traceback; this defaults to `5`.

`cgitb.html(info, context=5)`

    
This function handles the exception described by info (a 3-tuple containing
the result of `sys.exc_info()`), formatting its traceback as HTML and
returning the result as a string. The optional argument context is the number
of lines of context to display around the current line of source code in the
traceback; this defaults to `5`.

`cgitb.handler(info=None)`

    
This function handles an exception using the default settings (that is, show a
report in the browser, but don’t log to a file). This can be used when you’ve
caught an exception and want to report it using `cgitb`. The optional info
argument should be a 3-tuple containing an exception type, exception value,
and traceback object, exactly like the tuple returned by `sys.exc_info()`. If
the info argument is not supplied, the current exception is obtained from
`sys.exc_info()`.
