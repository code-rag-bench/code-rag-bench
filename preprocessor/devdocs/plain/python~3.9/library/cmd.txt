# cmd — Support for line-oriented command interpreters

Source code: Lib/cmd.py

The `Cmd` class provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command
interpreters. These are often useful for test harnesses, administrative tools,
and prototypes that will later be wrapped in a more sophisticated interface.

`class cmd.Cmd(completekey='tab', stdin=None, stdout=None)`

    
A `Cmd` instance or subclass instance is a line-oriented interpreter
framework. There is no good reason to instantiate `Cmd` itself; rather, it’s
useful as a superclass of an interpreter class you define yourself in order to
inherit `Cmd`’s methods and encapsulate action methods.

The optional argument completekey is the `readline` name of a completion key;
it defaults to `Tab`. If completekey is not `None` and `readline` is
available, command completion is done automatically.

The optional arguments stdin and stdout specify the input and output file
objects that the Cmd instance or subclass instance will use for input and
output. If not specified, they will default to `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout`.

If you want a given stdin to be used, make sure to set the instance’s
`use_rawinput` attribute to `False`, otherwise stdin will be ignored.

## Cmd Objects

A `Cmd` instance has the following methods:

`Cmd.cmdloop(intro=None)`

    
Repeatedly issue a prompt, accept input, parse an initial prefix off the
received input, and dispatch to action methods, passing them the remainder of
the line as argument.

The optional argument is a banner or intro string to be issued before the
first prompt (this overrides the `intro` class attribute).

If the `readline` module is loaded, input will automatically inherit bash-like
history-list editing (e.g. `Control-P` scrolls back to the last command,
`Control-N` forward to the next one, `Control-F` moves the cursor to the right
non-destructively, `Control-B` moves the cursor to the left non-destructively,
etc.).

An end-of-file on input is passed back as the string `'EOF'`.

An interpreter instance will recognize a command name `foo` if and only if it
has a method `do_foo()`. As a special case, a line beginning with the
character `'?'` is dispatched to the method `do_help()`. As another special
case, a line beginning with the character `'!'` is dispatched to the method
`do_shell()` (if such a method is defined).

This method will return when the `postcmd()` method returns a true value. The
stop argument to `postcmd()` is the return value from the command’s
corresponding `do_*()` method.

If completion is enabled, completing commands will be done automatically, and
completing of commands args is done by calling `complete_foo()` with arguments
text, line, begidx, and endidx. text is the string prefix we are attempting to
match: all returned matches must begin with it. line is the current input line
with leading whitespace removed, begidx and endidx are the beginning and
ending indexes of the prefix text, which could be used to provide different
completion depending upon which position the argument is in.

All subclasses of `Cmd` inherit a predefined `do_help()`. This method, called
with an argument `'bar'`, invokes the corresponding method `help_bar()`, and
if that is not present, prints the docstring of `do_bar()`, if available. With
no argument, `do_help()` lists all available help topics (that is, all
commands with corresponding `help_*()` methods or commands that have
docstrings), and also lists any undocumented commands.

`Cmd.onecmd(str)`

    
Interpret the argument as though it had been typed in response to the prompt.
This may be overridden, but should not normally need to be; see the `precmd()`
and `postcmd()` methods for useful execution hooks. The return value is a flag
indicating whether interpretation of commands by the interpreter should stop.
If there is a `do_*()` method for the command str, the return value of that
method is returned, otherwise the return value from the `default()` method is
returned.

`Cmd.emptyline()`

    
Method called when an empty line is entered in response to the prompt. If this
method is not overridden, it repeats the last nonempty command entered.

`Cmd.default(line)`

    
Method called on an input line when the command prefix is not recognized. If
this method is not overridden, it prints an error message and returns.

`Cmd.completedefault(text, line, begidx, endidx)`

    
Method called to complete an input line when no command-specific
`complete_*()` method is available. By default, it returns an empty list.

`Cmd.precmd(line)`

    
Hook method executed just before the command line line is interpreted, but
after the input prompt is generated and issued. This method is a stub in
`Cmd`; it exists to be overridden by subclasses. The return value is used as
the command which will be executed by the `onecmd()` method; the `precmd()`
implementation may re-write the command or simply return line unchanged.

`Cmd.postcmd(stop, line)`

    
Hook method executed just after a command dispatch is finished. This method is
a stub in `Cmd`; it exists to be overridden by subclasses. line is the command
line which was executed, and stop is a flag which indicates whether execution
will be terminated after the call to `postcmd()`; this will be the return
value of the `onecmd()` method. The return value of this method will be used
as the new value for the internal flag which corresponds to stop; returning
false will cause interpretation to continue.

`Cmd.preloop()`

    
Hook method executed once when `cmdloop()` is called. This method is a stub in
`Cmd`; it exists to be overridden by subclasses.

`Cmd.postloop()`

    
Hook method executed once when `cmdloop()` is about to return. This method is
a stub in `Cmd`; it exists to be overridden by subclasses.

Instances of `Cmd` subclasses have some public instance variables:

`Cmd.prompt`

    
The prompt issued to solicit input.

`Cmd.identchars`

    
The string of characters accepted for the command prefix.

`Cmd.lastcmd`

    
The last nonempty command prefix seen.

`Cmd.cmdqueue`

    
A list of queued input lines. The cmdqueue list is checked in `cmdloop()` when
new input is needed; if it is nonempty, its elements will be processed in
order, as if entered at the prompt.

`Cmd.intro`

    
A string to issue as an intro or banner. May be overridden by giving the
`cmdloop()` method an argument.

`Cmd.doc_header`

    
The header to issue if the help output has a section for documented commands.

`Cmd.misc_header`

    
The header to issue if the help output has a section for miscellaneous help
topics (that is, there are `help_*()` methods without corresponding `do_*()`
methods).

`Cmd.undoc_header`

    
The header to issue if the help output has a section for undocumented commands
(that is, there are `do_*()` methods without corresponding `help_*()`
methods).

`Cmd.ruler`

    
The character used to draw separator lines under the help-message headers. If
empty, no ruler line is drawn. It defaults to `'='`.

`Cmd.use_rawinput`

    
A flag, defaulting to true. If true, `cmdloop()` uses `input()` to display a
prompt and read the next command; if false, `sys.stdout.write()` and
`sys.stdin.readline()` are used. (This means that by importing `readline`, on
systems that support it, the interpreter will automatically support Emacs-like
line editing and command-history keystrokes.)

## Cmd Example

The `cmd` module is mainly useful for building custom shells that let a user
work with a program interactively.

This section presents a simple example of how to build a shell around a few of
the commands in the `turtle` module.

Basic turtle commands such as `forward()` are added to a `Cmd` subclass with
method named `do_forward()`. The argument is converted to a number and
dispatched to the turtle module. The docstring is used in the help utility
provided by the shell.

The example also includes a basic record and playback facility implemented
with the `precmd()` method which is responsible for converting the input to
lowercase and writing the commands to a file. The `do_playback()` method reads
the file and adds the recorded commands to the `cmdqueue` for immediate
playback:

    
    import cmd, sys
    from turtle import *
    
    class TurtleShell(cmd.Cmd):
        intro = 'Welcome to the turtle shell.   Type help or ? to list commands.\n'
        prompt = '(turtle) '
        file = None
    
        # ----- basic turtle commands -----
        def do_forward(self, arg):
            'Move the turtle forward by the specified distance:  FORWARD 10'
            forward(*parse(arg))
        def do_right(self, arg):
            'Turn turtle right by given number of degrees:  RIGHT 20'
            right(*parse(arg))
        def do_left(self, arg):
            'Turn turtle left by given number of degrees:  LEFT 90'
            left(*parse(arg))
        def do_goto(self, arg):
            'Move turtle to an absolute position with changing orientation.  GOTO 100 200'
            goto(*parse(arg))
        def do_home(self, arg):
            'Return turtle to the home position:  HOME'
            home()
        def do_circle(self, arg):
            'Draw circle with given radius an options extent and steps:  CIRCLE 50'
            circle(*parse(arg))
        def do_position(self, arg):

            'Print the current turtle heading in degrees:  HEADING'
            print('Current heading is %d\n' % (heading(),))
        def do_color(self, arg):
            'Set the color:  COLOR BLUE'
            color(arg.lower())
        def do_undo(self, arg):

        def do_reset(self, arg):

            reset()
        def do_bye(self, arg):
            'Stop recording, close the turtle window, and exit:  BYE'
            print('Thank you for using Turtle')
            self.close()
            bye()
            return True
    
        # ----- record and playback -----
        def do_record(self, arg):
            'Save future commands to filename:  RECORD rose.cmd'
            self.file = open(arg, 'w')
        def do_playback(self, arg):
            'Playback commands from a file:  PLAYBACK rose.cmd'
            self.close()
            with open(arg) as f:
                self.cmdqueue.extend(f.read().splitlines())
        def precmd(self, line):
            line = line.lower()
            if self.file and 'playback' not in line:
                print(line, file=self.file)
            return line
        def close(self):
            if self.file:
                self.file.close()
                self.file = None
    
    def parse(arg):
        'Convert a series of zero or more numbers to an argument tuple'
        return tuple(map(int, arg.split()))

Here is a sample session with the turtle shell showing the help functions,
using blank lines to repeat commands, and the simple record and playback
facility:

    
    Welcome to the turtle shell.   Type help or ? to list commands.
    
    (turtle) ?
    
    Documented commands (type help <topic>):
    ========================================
