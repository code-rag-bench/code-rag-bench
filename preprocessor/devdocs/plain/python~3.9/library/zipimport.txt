# zipimport — Import modules from Zip archives

Source code: Lib/zipimport.py

This module adds the ability to import Python modules (`*.py`, `*.pyc`) and
packages from ZIP-format archives. It is usually not needed to use the
`zipimport` module explicitly; it is automatically used by the built-in
`import` mechanism for `sys.path` items that are paths to ZIP archives.

Typically, `sys.path` is a list of directory names as strings. This module
also allows an item of `sys.path` to be a string naming a ZIP file archive.
The ZIP archive can contain a subdirectory structure to support package
imports, and a path within the archive can be specified to only import from a
subdirectory. For example, the path `example.zip/lib/` would only import from
the `lib/` subdirectory within the archive.

Any files may be present in the ZIP archive, but only files `.py` and `.pyc`
are available for import. ZIP import of dynamic modules (`.pyd`, `.so`) is
disallowed. Note that if an archive only contains `.py` files, Python will not
attempt to modify the archive by adding the corresponding `.pyc` file, meaning
that if a ZIP archive doesn’t contain `.pyc` files, importing may be rather
slow.

Changed in version 3.8: Previously, ZIP archives with an archive comment were
not supported.

PEP 273 \- Import Modules from Zip Archives

    
Written by James C. Ahlstrom, who also provided an implementation. Python 2.3
follows the specification in PEP 273, but uses an implementation written by
Just van Rossum that uses the import hooks described in PEP 302.

PEP 302 \- New Import Hooks

    
The PEP to add the import hooks that help this module work.

This module defines an exception:

`exception zipimport.ZipImportError`

    
Exception raised by zipimporter objects. It’s a subclass of `ImportError`, so
it can be caught as `ImportError`, too.

## zipimporter Objects

`zipimporter` is the class for importing ZIP files.

`class zipimport.zipimporter(archivepath)`

    
Create a new zipimporter instance. archivepath must be a path to a ZIP file,
or to a specific path within a ZIP file. For example, an archivepath of
`foo/bar.zip/lib` will look for modules in the `lib` directory inside the ZIP
file `foo/bar.zip` (provided that it exists).

`ZipImportError` is raised if archivepath doesn’t point to a valid ZIP
archive.

`find_module(fullname[, path])`

    
Search for a module specified by fullname. fullname must be the fully
qualified (dotted) module name. It returns the zipimporter instance itself if
the module was found, or `None` if it wasn’t. The optional path argument is
ignored—it’s there for compatibility with the importer protocol.

`get_code(fullname)`

    
Return the code object for the specified module. Raise `ZipImportError` if the
module couldn’t be found.

`get_data(pathname)`

    
Return the data associated with pathname. Raise `OSError` if the file wasn’t
found.

Changed in version 3.3: `IOError` used to be raised instead of `OSError`.

`get_filename(fullname)`

    
Return the value `__file__` would be set to if the specified module was
imported. Raise `ZipImportError` if the module couldn’t be found.

New in version 3.1.

`get_source(fullname)`

    
Return the source code for the specified module. Raise `ZipImportError` if the
module couldn’t be found, return `None` if the archive does contain the
module, but has no source for it.

`is_package(fullname)`

    
Return `True` if the module specified by fullname is a package. Raise
`ZipImportError` if the module couldn’t be found.

`load_module(fullname)`

    
Load the module specified by fullname. fullname must be the fully qualified
(dotted) module name. It returns the imported module, or raises
`ZipImportError` if it wasn’t found.

`archive`

    
The file name of the importer’s associated ZIP file, without a possible
subpath.

`prefix`

    
The subpath within the ZIP file where modules are searched. This is the empty
string for zipimporter objects which point to the root of the ZIP file.

The `archive` and `prefix` attributes, when combined with a slash, equal the
original archivepath argument given to the `zipimporter` constructor.

## Examples

Here is an example that imports a module from a ZIP archive - note that the
`zipimport` module is not explicitly used.

    
    $ unzip -l example.zip
    Archive:  example.zip
      Length     Date   Time    Name
     --------    ----   ----    ----
         8467  11-26-02 22:30   jwzthreading.py
     --------                   -------
         8467                   1 file
    $ ./python
    Python 2.3 (#1, Aug 1 2003, 19:54:32)
    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.path.insert(0, 'example.zip')  # Add .zip file to front of path
    >>> import jwzthreading
    >>> jwzthreading.__file__
    'example.zip/jwzthreading.py'
