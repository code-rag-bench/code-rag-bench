# tkinter.tix — Extension widgets for Tk

Source code: Lib/tkinter/tix.py

Deprecated since version 3.6: This Tk extension is unmaintained and should not
be used in new code. Use `tkinter.ttk` instead.

The `tkinter.tix` (Tk Interface Extension) module provides an additional rich
set of widgets. Although the standard Tk library has many useful widgets, they
are far from complete. The `tkinter.tix` library provides most of the commonly
needed widgets that are missing from standard Tk: `HList`, `ComboBox`,
`Control` (a.k.a. SpinBox) and an assortment of scrollable widgets.
`tkinter.tix` also includes many more widgets that are generally useful in a
wide range of applications: `NoteBook`, `FileEntry`, `PanedWindow`, etc; there
are more than 40 of them.

With all these new widgets, you can introduce new interaction techniques into
applications, creating more useful and more intuitive user interfaces. You can
design your application by choosing the most appropriate widgets to match the
special needs of your application and users.

Tix Development Applications

    
Tix applications for development of Tix and Tkinter programs. Tide
applications work under Tk or Tkinter, and include TixInspect, an inspector to
remotely modify and debug Tix/Tk/Tkinter applications.

## Using Tix

`class tkinter.tix.Tk(screenName=None, baseName=None, className='Tix')`

    
Toplevel widget of Tix which represents mostly the main window of an
application. It has an associated Tcl interpreter.

Classes in the `tkinter.tix` module subclasses the classes in the `tkinter`.
The former imports the latter, so to use `tkinter.tix` with Tkinter, all you
need to do is to import one module. In general, you can just import
`tkinter.tix`, and replace the toplevel call to `tkinter.Tk` with `tix.Tk`:

    
    from tkinter import tix
    from tkinter.constants import *
    root = tix.Tk()
    
To use `tkinter.tix`, you must have the Tix widgets installed, usually
alongside your installation of the Tk widgets. To test your installation, try
the following:

    
    from tkinter import tix
    root = tix.Tk()
    root.tk.eval('package require Tix')
    
## Tix Widgets

Tix introduces over 40 widget classes to the `tkinter` repertoire.

### Basic Widgets

`class tkinter.tix.Balloon`

    
A Balloon that pops up over a widget to provide help. When the user moves the
cursor inside a widget to which a Balloon widget has been bound, a small pop-
up window with a descriptive message will be shown on the screen.

`class tkinter.tix.ButtonBox`

    
The ButtonBox widget creates a box of buttons, such as is commonly used for
`Ok Cancel`.

`class tkinter.tix.ComboBox`

    
The ComboBox widget is similar to the combo box control in MS Windows. The
user can select a choice by either typing in the entry subwidget or selecting
from the listbox subwidget.

`class tkinter.tix.Control`

    
The Control widget is also known as the `SpinBox` widget. The user can adjust
the value by pressing the two arrow buttons or by entering the value directly
into the entry. The new value will be checked against the user-defined upper
and lower limits.

`class tkinter.tix.LabelEntry`

    
The LabelEntry widget packages an entry widget and a label into one mega
widget. It can be used to simplify the creation of “entry-form” type of
interface.

`class tkinter.tix.LabelFrame`

    
The LabelFrame widget packages a frame widget and a label into one mega
widget. To create widgets inside a LabelFrame widget, one creates the new
widgets relative to the `frame` subwidget and manage them inside the `frame`
subwidget.

`class tkinter.tix.Meter`

    
The Meter widget can be used to show the progress of a background job which
may take a long time to execute.

`class tkinter.tix.OptionMenu`

    
The OptionMenu creates a menu button of options.

`class tkinter.tix.PopupMenu`

    
The PopupMenu widget can be used as a replacement of the `tk_popup` command.
The advantage of the `Tix` `PopupMenu` widget is it requires less application
code to manipulate.

`class tkinter.tix.Select`

    
The Select widget is a container of button subwidgets. It can be used to
provide radio-box or check-box style of selection options for the user.

`class tkinter.tix.StdButtonBox`

    
The StdButtonBox widget is a group of standard buttons for Motif-like dialog
boxes.

### File Selectors

`class tkinter.tix.DirList`

    
The DirList widget displays a list view of a directory, its previous
directories and its sub-directories. The user can choose one of the
directories displayed in the list or change to another directory.

`class tkinter.tix.DirTree`

    
The DirTree widget displays a tree view of a directory, its previous
directories and its sub-directories. The user can choose one of the
directories displayed in the list or change to another directory.

`class tkinter.tix.DirSelectDialog`

    
The DirSelectDialog widget presents the directories in the file system in a
dialog window. The user can use this dialog window to navigate through the
file system to select the desired directory.

`class tkinter.tix.DirSelectBox`

    
The `DirSelectBox` is similar to the standard Motif(TM) directory-selection
box. It is generally used for the user to choose a directory. DirSelectBox
stores the directories mostly recently selected into a ComboBox widget so that
they can be quickly selected again.

`class tkinter.tix.ExFileSelectBox`

    
The ExFileSelectBox widget is usually embedded in a tixExFileSelectDialog
widget. It provides a convenient method for the user to select files. The
style of the `ExFileSelectBox` widget is very similar to the standard file
dialog on MS Windows 3.1.

`class tkinter.tix.FileSelectBox`

    
The FileSelectBox is similar to the standard Motif(TM) file-selection box. It
is generally used for the user to choose a file. FileSelectBox stores the
files mostly recently selected into a `ComboBox` widget so that they can be
quickly selected again.

`class tkinter.tix.FileEntry`

    
The FileEntry widget can be used to input a filename. The user can type in the
filename manually. Alternatively, the user can press the button widget that
sits next to the entry, which will bring up a file selection dialog.

### Hierarchical ListBox

`class tkinter.tix.HList`

    
The HList widget can be used to display any data that have a hierarchical
structure, for example, file system directory trees. The list entries are
indented and connected by branch lines according to their places in the
hierarchy.

`class tkinter.tix.CheckList`

    
The CheckList widget displays a list of items to be selected by the user.
CheckList acts similarly to the Tk checkbutton or radiobutton widgets, except
it is capable of handling many more items than checkbuttons or radiobuttons.

`class tkinter.tix.Tree`

    
The Tree widget can be used to display hierarchical data in a tree form. The
user can adjust the view of the tree by opening or closing parts of the tree.

### Tabular ListBox

`class tkinter.tix.TList`

    
The TList widget can be used to display data in a tabular format. The list
entries of a `TList` widget are similar to the entries in the Tk listbox
widget. The main differences are (1) the `TList` widget can display the list
entries in a two dimensional format and (2) you can use graphical images as
well as multiple colors and fonts for the list entries.

### Manager Widgets

`class tkinter.tix.PanedWindow`

    
The PanedWindow widget allows the user to interactively manipulate the sizes
of several panes. The panes can be arranged either vertically or horizontally.
The user changes the sizes of the panes by dragging the resize handle between
two panes.

`class tkinter.tix.ListNoteBook`

    
The ListNoteBook widget is very similar to the `TixNoteBook` widget: it can be
used to display many windows in a limited space using a notebook metaphor. The
notebook is divided into a stack of pages (windows). At one time only one of
these pages can be shown. The user can navigate through these pages by
choosing the name of the desired page in the `hlist` subwidget.

`class tkinter.tix.NoteBook`

    
The NoteBook widget can be used to display many windows in a limited space
using a notebook metaphor. The notebook is divided into a stack of pages. At
one time only one of these pages can be shown. The user can navigate through
these pages by choosing the visual “tabs” at the top of the NoteBook widget.

### Image Types

The `tkinter.tix` module adds:

  * pixmap capabilities to all `tkinter.tix` and `tkinter` widgets to create color images from XPM files. 
  * Compound image types can be used to create images that consists of multiple horizontal lines; each line is composed of a series of items (texts, bitmaps, images or spaces) arranged from left to right. For example, a compound image can be used to display a bitmap and a text string simultaneously in a Tk `Button` widget. 

### Miscellaneous Widgets

`class tkinter.tix.InputOnly`

    
The InputOnly widgets are to accept inputs from the user, which can be done
with the `bind` command (Unix only).

### Form Geometry Manager

In addition, `tkinter.tix` augments `tkinter` by providing:

`class tkinter.tix.Form`

    
The Form geometry manager based on attachment rules for all Tk widgets.

## Tix Commands

`class tkinter.tix.tixCommand`

    
The tix commands provide access to miscellaneous elements of `Tix`’s internal
state and the `Tix` application context. Most of the information manipulated
by these methods pertains to the application as a whole, or to a screen or
display, rather than to a particular window.

To view the current settings, the common usage is:

    
    from tkinter import tix
    root = tix.Tk()
    print(root.tix_configure())
    
`tixCommand.tix_configure(cnf=None, **kw)`

    
Query or modify the configuration options of the Tix application context. If
no option is specified, returns a dictionary all of the available options. If
option is specified with no value, then the method returns a list describing
the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist
of the value returned if no option is specified). If one or more option-value
pairs are specified, then the method modifies the given option(s) to have the
given value(s); in this case the method returns an empty string. Option may be
any of the configuration options.

`tixCommand.tix_cget(option)`

    
Returns the current value of the configuration option given by option. Option
may be any of the configuration options.

`tixCommand.tix_getbitmap(name)`

    
Locates a bitmap file of the name `name.xpm` or `name` in one of the bitmap
directories (see the `tix_addbitmapdir()` method). By using `tix_getbitmap()`,
you can avoid hard coding the pathnames of the bitmap files in your
application. When successful, it returns the complete pathname of the bitmap
file, prefixed with the character `@`. The returned value can be used to
configure the `bitmap` option of the Tk and Tix widgets.

`tixCommand.tix_addbitmapdir(directory)`

    
Tix maintains a list of directories under which the `tix_getimage()` and
`tix_getbitmap()` methods will search for image files. The standard bitmap
directory is `$TIX_LIBRARY/bitmaps`. The `tix_addbitmapdir()` method adds
directory into this list. By using this method, the image files of an
applications can also be located using the `tix_getimage()` or
`tix_getbitmap()` method.

`tixCommand.tix_filedialog([dlgclass])`

    
Returns the file selection dialog that may be shared among different calls
from this application. This method will create a file selection dialog widget
when it is called the first time. This dialog will be returned by all
subsequent calls to `tix_filedialog()`. An optional dlgclass parameter can be
passed as a string to specified what type of file selection dialog widget is
desired. Possible options are `tix`, `FileSelectDialog` or
`tixExFileSelectDialog`.

`tixCommand.tix_getimage(self, name)`

    
Locates an image file of the name `name.xpm`, `name.xbm` or `name.ppm` in one
of the bitmap directories (see the `tix_addbitmapdir()` method above). If more
than one file with the same name (but different extensions) exist, then the
image type is chosen according to the depth of the X display: xbm images are
chosen on monochrome displays and color images are chosen on color displays.
By using `tix_getimage()`, you can avoid hard coding the pathnames of the
image files in your application. When successful, this method returns the name
of the newly created image, which can be used to configure the `image` option
of the Tk and Tix widgets.

`tixCommand.tix_option_get(name)`

    
Gets the options maintained by the Tix scheme mechanism.

`tixCommand.tix_resetoptions(newScheme, newFontSet[, newScmPrio])`

    
Resets the scheme and fontset of the Tix application to newScheme and
newFontSet, respectively. This affects only those widgets created after this
call. Therefore, it is best to call the resetoptions method before the
creation of any widgets in a Tix application.

The optional parameter newScmPrio can be given to reset the priority level of
the Tk options set by the Tix schemes.

Because of the way Tk handles the X option database, after Tix has been has
imported and inited, it is not possible to reset the color schemes and font
sets using the `tix_config()` method. Instead, the `tix_resetoptions()` method
must be used.
