# email.generator: Generating MIME documents

Source code: Lib/email/generator.py

One of the most common tasks is to generate the flat (serialized) version of
the email message represented by a message object structure. You will need to
do this if you want to send your message via `smtplib.SMTP.sendmail()` or the
`nntplib` module, or print the message on the console. Taking a message object
structure and producing a serialized representation is the job of the
generator classes.

As with the `email.parser` module, you aren’t limited to the functionality of
the bundled generator; you could write one from scratch yourself. However the
bundled generator knows how to generate most email in a standards-compliant
way, should handle MIME and non-MIME email messages just fine, and is designed
so that the bytes-oriented parsing and generation operations are inverses,
assuming the same non-transforming `policy` is used for both. That is, parsing
the serialized byte stream via the `BytesParser` class and then regenerating
the serialized byte stream using `BytesGenerator` should produce output
identical to the input 1. (On the other hand, using the generator on an
`EmailMessage` constructed by program may result in changes to the
`EmailMessage` object as defaults are filled in.)

The `Generator` class can be used to flatten a message into a text (as opposed
to binary) serialized representation, but since Unicode cannot represent
binary data directly, the message is of necessity transformed into something
that contains only ASCII characters, using the standard email RFC Content
Transfer Encoding techniques for encoding email messages for transport over
channels that are not “8 bit clean”.

To accommodate reproducible processing of SMIME-signed messages `Generator`
disables header folding for message parts of type `multipart/signed` and all
subparts.

`class email.generator.BytesGenerator(outfp, mangle_from_=None,
maxheaderlen=None, *, policy=None)`

    
Return a `BytesGenerator` object that will write any message provided to the
`flatten()` method, or any surrogateescape encoded text provided to the
`write()` method, to the file-like object outfp. outfp must support a `write`
method that accepts binary data.

If optional mangle_from_ is `True`, put a `>` character in front of any line
in the body that starts with the exact string `"From "`, that is `From`
followed by a space at the beginning of a line. mangle_from_ defaults to the
value of the `mangle_from_` setting of the policy (which is `True` for the
`compat32` policy and `False` for all others). mangle_from_ is intended for
use when messages are stored in unix mbox format (see `mailbox` and WHY THE
CONTENT-LENGTH FORMAT IS BAD).

If maxheaderlen is not `None`, refold any header lines that are longer than
maxheaderlen, or if `0`, do not rewrap any headers. If manheaderlen is `None`
(the default), wrap headers and other message lines according to the policy
settings.

If policy is specified, use that policy to control message generation. If
policy is `None` (the default), use the policy associated with the `Message`
or `EmailMessage` object passed to `flatten` to control the message
generation. See `email.policy` for details on what policy controls.

New in version 3.2.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the policy keyword.

Changed in version 3.6: The default behavior of the mangle_from_ and
maxheaderlen parameters is to follow the policy.

`flatten(msg, unixfrom=False, linesep=None)`

    
Print the textual representation of the message object structure rooted at msg
to the output file specified when the `BytesGenerator` instance was created.

If the `policy` option `cte_type` is `8bit` (the default), copy any headers in
the original parsed message that have not been modified to the output with any
bytes with the high bit set reproduced as in the original, and preserve the
non-ASCII Content-Transfer-Encoding of any body parts that have them. If
`cte_type` is `7bit`, convert the bytes with the high bit set as needed using
an ASCII-compatible Content-Transfer-Encoding. That is, transform parts with
non-ASCII Content-Transfer-Encoding (Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit) to an
ASCII compatible Content-Transfer-Encoding, and encode RFC-invalid non-ASCII
bytes in headers using the MIME `unknown-8bit` character set, thus rendering
them RFC-compliant.

If unixfrom is `True`, print the envelope header delimiter used by the Unix
mailbox format (see `mailbox`) before the first of the RFC 5322 headers of the
root message object. If the root object has no envelope header, craft a
standard one. The default is `False`. Note that for subparts, no envelope
header is ever printed.

If linesep is not `None`, use it as the separator character between all the
lines of the flattened message. If linesep is `None` (the default), use the
value specified in the policy.

`clone(fp)`

    
Return an independent clone of this `BytesGenerator` instance with the exact
same option settings, and fp as the new outfp.

`write(s)`

    
Encode s using the `ASCII` codec and the `surrogateescape` error handler, and
pass it to the write method of the outfp passed to the `BytesGenerator`’s
constructor.

As a convenience, `EmailMessage` provides the methods `as_bytes()` and
`bytes(aMessage)` (a.k.a. `__bytes__()`), which simplify the generation of a
serialized binary representation of a message object. For more detail, see
`email.message`.

Because strings cannot represent binary data, the `Generator` class must
convert any binary data in any message it flattens to an ASCII compatible
format, by converting them to an ASCII compatible Content-Transfer_Encoding.
Using the terminology of the email RFCs, you can think of this as `Generator`
serializing to an I/O stream that is not “8 bit clean”. In other words, most
applications will want to be using `BytesGenerator`, and not `Generator`.

`class email.generator.Generator(outfp, mangle_from_=None, maxheaderlen=None,
*, policy=None)`

    
Return a `Generator` object that will write any message provided to the
`flatten()` method, or any text provided to the `write()` method, to the file-
like object outfp. outfp must support a `write` method that accepts string
data.

If optional mangle_from_ is `True`, put a `>` character in front of any line
in the body that starts with the exact string `"From "`, that is `From`
followed by a space at the beginning of a line. mangle_from_ defaults to the
value of the `mangle_from_` setting of the policy (which is `True` for the
`compat32` policy and `False` for all others). mangle_from_ is intended for
use when messages are stored in unix mbox format (see `mailbox` and WHY THE
CONTENT-LENGTH FORMAT IS BAD).

If maxheaderlen is not `None`, refold any header lines that are longer than
maxheaderlen, or if `0`, do not rewrap any headers. If manheaderlen is `None`
(the default), wrap headers and other message lines according to the policy
settings.

If policy is specified, use that policy to control message generation. If
policy is `None` (the default), use the policy associated with the `Message`
or `EmailMessage` object passed to `flatten` to control the message
generation. See `email.policy` for details on what policy controls.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the policy keyword.

Changed in version 3.6: The default behavior of the mangle_from_ and
maxheaderlen parameters is to follow the policy.

`flatten(msg, unixfrom=False, linesep=None)`

    
Print the textual representation of the message object structure rooted at msg
to the output file specified when the `Generator` instance was created.

If the `policy` option `cte_type` is `8bit`, generate the message as if the
option were set to `7bit`. (This is required because strings cannot represent
non-ASCII bytes.) Convert any bytes with the high bit set as needed using an
ASCII-compatible Content-Transfer-Encoding. That is, transform parts with non-
ASCII Content-Transfer-Encoding (Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit) to an ASCII
compatible Content-Transfer-Encoding, and encode RFC-invalid non-ASCII bytes
in headers using the MIME `unknown-8bit` character set, thus rendering them
RFC-compliant.

If unixfrom is `True`, print the envelope header delimiter used by the Unix
mailbox format (see `mailbox`) before the first of the RFC 5322 headers of the
root message object. If the root object has no envelope header, craft a
standard one. The default is `False`. Note that for subparts, no envelope
header is ever printed.

If linesep is not `None`, use it as the separator character between all the
lines of the flattened message. If linesep is `None` (the default), use the
value specified in the policy.

Changed in version 3.2: Added support for re-encoding `8bit` message bodies,
and the linesep argument.

`clone(fp)`

    
Return an independent clone of this `Generator` instance with the exact same
options, and fp as the new outfp.

`write(s)`

    
Write s to the write method of the outfp passed to the `Generator`’s
constructor. This provides just enough file-like API for `Generator` instances
to be used in the `print()` function.

As a convenience, `EmailMessage` provides the methods `as_string()` and
`str(aMessage)` (a.k.a. `__str__()`), which simplify the generation of a
formatted string representation of a message object. For more detail, see
`email.message`.

The `email.generator` module also provides a derived class,
`DecodedGenerator`, which is like the `Generator` base class, except that non-
text parts are not serialized, but are instead represented in the output
stream by a string derived from a template filled in with information about
the part.

`class email.generator.DecodedGenerator(outfp, mangle_from_=None,
maxheaderlen=None, fmt=None, *, policy=None)`

    
Act like `Generator`, except that for any subpart of the message passed to
`Generator.flatten()`, if the subpart is of main type text, print the decoded
payload of the subpart, and if the main type is not text, instead of printing
it fill in the string fmt using information from the part and print the
resulting filled-in string.

To fill in fmt, execute `fmt % part_info`, where `part_info` is a dictionary
composed of the following keys and values:

  * `type` – Full MIME type of the non-text part
  * `maintype` – Main MIME type of the non-text part
  * `subtype` – Sub-MIME type of the non-text part
  * `filename` – Filename of the non-text part
  * `description` – Description associated with the non-text part
  * `encoding` – Content transfer encoding of the non-text part

If fmt is `None`, use the following default fmt:

“[Non-text (%(type)s) part of message omitted, filename %(filename)s]”

Optional _mangle_from_ and maxheaderlen are as with the `Generator` base
class.

#### Footnotes

`1`

    
This statement assumes that you use the appropriate setting for `unixfrom`,
and that there are no `policy` settings calling for automatic adjustments (for
example, `refold_source` must be `none`, which is not the default). It is also
not 100% true, since if the message does not conform to the RFC standards
occasionally information about the exact original text is lost during parsing
error recovery. It is a goal to fix these latter edge cases when possible.
