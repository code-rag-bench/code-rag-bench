# codeop — Compile Python code

Source code: Lib/codeop.py

The `codeop` module provides utilities upon which the Python read-eval-print
loop can be emulated, as is done in the `code` module. As a result, you
probably don’t want to use the module directly; if you want to include such a
loop in your program you probably want to use the `code` module instead.

There are two parts to this job:

  1. Being able to tell if a line of input completes a Python statement: in short, telling whether to print ‘`>>>`’ or ‘`...`’ next.
  2. Remembering which future statements the user has entered, so subsequent input can be compiled with these in effect.

The `codeop` module provides a way of doing each of these things, and a way of
doing them both.

To do just the former:

`codeop.compile_command(source, filename="<input>", symbol="single")`

    
Tries to compile source, which should be a string of Python code and return a
code object if source is valid Python code. In that case, the filename
attribute of the code object will be filename, which defaults to `'<input>'`.
Returns `None` if source is not valid Python code, but is a prefix of valid
Python code.

If there is a problem with source, an exception will be raised. `SyntaxError`
is raised if there is invalid Python syntax, and `OverflowError` or
`ValueError` if there is an invalid literal.

The symbol argument determines whether source is compiled as a statement
(`'single'`, the default), as a sequence of statements (`'exec'`) or as an
expression (`'eval'`). Any other value will cause `ValueError` to be raised.

Note

It is possible (but not likely) that the parser stops parsing with a
successful outcome before reaching the end of the source; in this case,
trailing symbols may be ignored instead of causing an error. For example, a
backslash followed by two newlines may be followed by arbitrary garbage. This
will be fixed once the API for the parser is better.

`class codeop.Compile`

    
Instances of this class have `__call__()` methods identical in signature to
the built-in function `compile()`, but with the difference that if the
instance compiles program text containing a `__future__` statement, the
instance ‘remembers’ and compiles all subsequent program texts with the
statement in force.

`class codeop.CommandCompiler`

    
Instances of this class have `__call__()` methods identical in signature to
`compile_command()`; the difference is that if the instance compiles program
text containing a `__future__` statement, the instance ‘remembers’ and
compiles all subsequent program texts with the statement in force.
