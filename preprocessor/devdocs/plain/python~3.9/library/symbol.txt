# symbol — Constants used with Python parse trees

Source code: Lib/symbol.py

This module provides constants which represent the numeric values of internal
nodes of the parse tree. Unlike most Python constants, these use lower-case
names. Refer to the file `Grammar/Grammar` in the Python distribution for the
definitions of the names in the context of the language grammar. The specific
numeric values which the names map to may change between Python versions.

Warning

The symbol module is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of
Python.

This module also provides one additional data object:

`symbol.sym_name`

    
Dictionary mapping the numeric values of the constants defined in this module
back to name strings, allowing more human-readable representation of parse
trees to be generated.
