# html — HyperText Markup Language support

Source code: Lib/html/__init__.py

This module defines utilities to manipulate HTML.

`html.escape(s, quote=True)`

    
Convert the characters `&`, `<` and `>` in string s to HTML-safe sequences.
Use this if you need to display text that might contain such characters in
HTML. If the optional flag quote is true, the characters (`"`) and (`'`) are
also translated; this helps for inclusion in an HTML attribute value delimited
by quotes, as in `<a href="...">`.

New in version 3.2.

`html.unescape(s)`

    
Convert all named and numeric character references (e.g. `&gt;`, `&#62;`,
`&#x3e;`) in the string s to the corresponding Unicode characters. This
function uses the rules defined by the HTML 5 standard for both valid and
invalid character references, and the `list of HTML 5 named character
references`.

New in version 3.4.

Submodules in the `html` package are:

  * `html.parser` – HTML/XHTML parser with lenient parsing mode
  * `html.entities` – HTML entity definitions
