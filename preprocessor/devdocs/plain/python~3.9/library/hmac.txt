# hmac — Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication

Source code: Lib/hmac.py

This module implements the HMAC algorithm as described by RFC 2104.

`hmac.new(key, msg=None, digestmod='')`

    
Return a new hmac object. key is a bytes or bytearray object giving the secret
key. If msg is present, the method call `update(msg)` is made. digestmod is
the digest name, digest constructor or module for the HMAC object to use. It
may be any name suitable to `hashlib.new()`. Despite its argument position, it
is required.

Changed in version 3.4: Parameter key can be a bytes or bytearray object.
Parameter msg can be of any type supported by `hashlib`. Parameter digestmod
can be the name of a hash algorithm.

Deprecated since version 3.4, removed in version 3.8: MD5 as implicit default
digest for digestmod is deprecated. The digestmod parameter is now required.
Pass it as a keyword argument to avoid awkwardness when you do not have an
initial msg.

`hmac.digest(key, msg, digest)`

    
Return digest of msg for given secret key and digest. The function is
equivalent to `HMAC(key, msg, digest).digest()`, but uses an optimized C or
inline implementation, which is faster for messages that fit into memory. The
parameters key, msg, and digest have the same meaning as in `new()`.

CPython implementation detail, the optimized C implementation is only used
when digest is a string and name of a digest algorithm, which is supported by
OpenSSL.

New in version 3.7.

An HMAC object has the following methods:

`HMAC.update(msg)`

    
Update the hmac object with msg. Repeated calls are equivalent to a single
call with the concatenation of all the arguments: `m.update(a); m.update(b)`
is equivalent to `m.update(a + b)`.

Changed in version 3.4: Parameter msg can be of any type supported by
`hashlib`.

`HMAC.digest()`

    
Return the digest of the bytes passed to the `update()` method so far. This
bytes object will be the same length as the digest_size of the digest given to
the constructor. It may contain non-ASCII bytes, including NUL bytes.

Warning

When comparing the output of `digest()` to an externally-supplied digest
during a verification routine, it is recommended to use the `compare_digest()`
function instead of the `==` operator to reduce the vulnerability to timing
attacks.

`HMAC.hexdigest()`

    
Like `digest()` except the digest is returned as a string twice the length
containing only hexadecimal digits. This may be used to exchange the value
safely in email or other non-binary environments.

Warning

When comparing the output of `hexdigest()` to an externally-supplied digest
during a verification routine, it is recommended to use the `compare_digest()`
function instead of the `==` operator to reduce the vulnerability to timing
attacks.

`HMAC.copy()`

    
Return a copy (“clone”) of the hmac object. This can be used to efficiently
compute the digests of strings that share a common initial substring.

A hash object has the following attributes:

`HMAC.digest_size`

    
The size of the resulting HMAC digest in bytes.

`HMAC.block_size`

    
The internal block size of the hash algorithm in bytes.

New in version 3.4.

`HMAC.name`

    
The canonical name of this HMAC, always lowercase, e.g. `hmac-md5`.

New in version 3.4.

Deprecated since version 3.9: The undocumented attributes `HMAC.digest_cons`,
`HMAC.inner`, and `HMAC.outer` are internal implementation details and will be
removed in Python 3.10.

This module also provides the following helper function:

`hmac.compare_digest(a, b)`

    
Return `a == b`. This function uses an approach designed to prevent timing
analysis by avoiding content-based short circuiting behaviour, making it
appropriate for cryptography. a and b must both be of the same type: either
`str` (ASCII only, as e.g. returned by `HMAC.hexdigest()`), or a bytes-like
object.

Note

If a and b are of different lengths, or if an error occurs, a timing attack
could theoretically reveal information about the types and lengths of a and
b—but not their values.

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.9: The function uses OpenSSL’s `CRYPTO_memcmp()`
internally when available.
