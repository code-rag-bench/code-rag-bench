# select — Waiting for I/O completion

This module provides access to the `select()` and `poll()` functions available
in most operating systems, `devpoll()` available on Solaris and derivatives,
`epoll()` available on Linux 2.5+ and `kqueue()` available on most BSD. Note
that on Windows, it only works for sockets; on other operating systems, it
also works for other file types (in particular, on Unix, it works on pipes).
It cannot be used on regular files to determine whether a file has grown since
it was last read.

Note

The `selectors` module allows high-level and efficient I/O multiplexing, built
upon the `select` module primitives. Users are encouraged to use the
`selectors` module instead, unless they want precise control over the OS-level
primitives used.

The module defines the following:

`exception select.error`

    
A deprecated alias of `OSError`.

Changed in version 3.3: Following PEP 3151, this class was made an alias of
`OSError`.

`select.devpoll()`

    
(Only supported on Solaris and derivatives.) Returns a `/dev/poll` polling
object; see section /dev/poll Polling Objects below for the methods supported
by devpoll objects.

`devpoll()` objects are linked to the number of file descriptors allowed at
the time of instantiation. If your program reduces this value, `devpoll()`
will fail. If your program increases this value, `devpoll()` may return an
incomplete list of active file descriptors.

The new file descriptor is non-inheritable.

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.4: The new file descriptor is now non-inheritable.

`select.epoll(sizehint=-1, flags=0)`

    
(Only supported on Linux 2.5.44 and newer.) Return an edge polling object,
which can be used as Edge or Level Triggered interface for I/O events.

sizehint informs epoll about the expected number of events to be registered.
It must be positive, or `-1` to use the default. It is only used on older
systems where `epoll_create1()` is not available; otherwise it has no effect
(though its value is still checked).

flags is deprecated and completely ignored. However, when supplied, its value
must be `0` or `select.EPOLL_CLOEXEC`, otherwise `OSError` is raised.

See the Edge and Level Trigger Polling (epoll) Objects section below for the
methods supported by epolling objects.

`epoll` objects support the context management protocol: when used in a `with`
statement, the new file descriptor is automatically closed at the end of the
block.

The new file descriptor is non-inheritable.

Changed in version 3.3: Added the flags parameter.

Changed in version 3.4: Support for the `with` statement was added. The new
file descriptor is now non-inheritable.

Deprecated since version 3.4: The flags parameter. `select.EPOLL_CLOEXEC` is
used by default now. Use `os.set_inheritable()` to make the file descriptor
inheritable.

`select.poll()`

    
(Not supported by all operating systems.) Returns a polling object, which
supports registering and unregistering file descriptors, and then polling them
for I/O events; see section Polling Objects below for the methods supported by
polling objects.

`select.kqueue()`

    
(Only supported on BSD.) Returns a kernel queue object; see section Kqueue
Objects below for the methods supported by kqueue objects.

The new file descriptor is non-inheritable.

Changed in version 3.4: The new file descriptor is now non-inheritable.

`select.kevent(ident, filter=KQ_FILTER_READ, flags=KQ_EV_ADD, fflags=0,
data=0, udata=0)`

    
(Only supported on BSD.) Returns a kernel event object; see section Kevent
Objects below for the methods supported by kevent objects.

`select.select(rlist, wlist, xlist[, timeout])`

    
This is a straightforward interface to the Unix `select()` system call. The
first three arguments are iterables of ‘waitable objects’: either integers
representing file descriptors or objects with a parameterless method named
`fileno()` returning such an integer:

  * rlist: wait until ready for reading
  * wlist: wait until ready for writing
  * xlist: wait for an “exceptional condition” (see the manual page for what your system considers such a condition)

Empty iterables are allowed, but acceptance of three empty iterables is
platform-dependent. (It is known to work on Unix but not on Windows.) The
optional timeout argument specifies a time-out as a floating point number in
seconds. When the timeout argument is omitted the function blocks until at
least one file descriptor is ready. A time-out value of zero specifies a poll
and never blocks.

The return value is a triple of lists of objects that are ready: subsets of
the first three arguments. When the time-out is reached without a file
descriptor becoming ready, three empty lists are returned.

Among the acceptable object types in the iterables are Python file objects
(e.g. `sys.stdin`, or objects returned by `open()` or `os.popen()`), socket
objects returned by `socket.socket()`. You may also define a wrapper class
yourself, as long as it has an appropriate `fileno()` method (that really
returns a file descriptor, not just a random integer).

Note

File objects on Windows are not acceptable, but sockets are. On Windows, the
underlying `select()` function is provided by the WinSock library, and does
not handle file descriptors that don’t originate from WinSock.

Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with a recomputed timeout
when interrupted by a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception
(see PEP 475 for the rationale), instead of raising `InterruptedError`.

`select.PIPE_BUF`

    
The minimum number of bytes which can be written without blocking to a pipe
when the pipe has been reported as ready for writing by `select()`, `poll()`
or another interface in this module. This doesn’t apply to other kind of file-
like objects such as sockets.

This value is guaranteed by POSIX to be at least 512.

Availability: Unix

New in version 3.2.

##  `/dev/poll` Polling Objects

Solaris and derivatives have `/dev/poll`. While `select()` is O(highest file
descriptor) and `poll()` is O(number of file descriptors), `/dev/poll` is
O(active file descriptors).

`/dev/poll` behaviour is very close to the standard `poll()` object.

`devpoll.close()`

    
Close the file descriptor of the polling object.

New in version 3.4.

`devpoll.closed`

    
`True` if the polling object is closed.

New in version 3.4.

`devpoll.fileno()`

    
Return the file descriptor number of the polling object.

New in version 3.4.

`devpoll.register(fd[, eventmask])`

    
Register a file descriptor with the polling object. Future calls to the
`poll()` method will then check whether the file descriptor has any pending
I/O events. fd can be either an integer, or an object with a `fileno()` method
that returns an integer. File objects implement `fileno()`, so they can also
be used as the argument.

eventmask is an optional bitmask describing the type of events you want to
check for. The constants are the same that with `poll()` object. The default
value is a combination of the constants `POLLIN`, `POLLPRI`, and `POLLOUT`.

Warning

Registering a file descriptor that’s already registered is not an error, but
the result is undefined. The appropriate action is to unregister or modify it
first. This is an important difference compared with `poll()`.

`devpoll.modify(fd[, eventmask])`

    
This method does an `unregister()` followed by a `register()`. It is (a bit)
more efficient that doing the same explicitly.

`devpoll.unregister(fd)`

    
Remove a file descriptor being tracked by a polling object. Just like the
`register()` method, fd can be an integer or an object with a `fileno()`
method that returns an integer.

Attempting to remove a file descriptor that was never registered is safely
ignored.

`devpoll.poll([timeout])`

    
Polls the set of registered file descriptors, and returns a possibly-empty
list containing `(fd, event)` 2-tuples for the descriptors that have events or
errors to report. fd is the file descriptor, and event is a bitmask with bits
set for the reported events for that descriptor — `POLLIN` for waiting input,
`POLLOUT` to indicate that the descriptor can be written to, and so forth. An
empty list indicates that the call timed out and no file descriptors had any
events to report. If timeout is given, it specifies the length of time in
milliseconds which the system will wait for events before returning. If
timeout is omitted, -1, or `None`, the call will block until there is an event
for this poll object.

Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with a recomputed timeout
when interrupted by a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception
(see PEP 475 for the rationale), instead of raising `InterruptedError`.

## Edge and Level Trigger Polling (epoll) Objects

https://linux.die.net/man/4/epoll

eventmask

Constant | Meaning  
---|---  
`EPOLLIN` | Available for read  
`EPOLLOUT` | Available for write  
`EPOLLPRI` | Urgent data for read  
`EPOLLERR` | Error condition happened on the assoc. fd  
`EPOLLHUP` | Hang up happened on the assoc. fd  
`EPOLLET` | Set Edge Trigger behavior, the default is Level Trigger behavior  
`EPOLLONESHOT` | Set one-shot behavior. After one event is pulled out, the fd is internally disabled  
`EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` | Wake only one epoll object when the associated fd has an event. The default (if this flag is not set) is to wake all epoll objects polling on a fd.  
`EPOLLRDHUP` | Stream socket peer closed connection or shut down writing half of connection.  
`EPOLLRDNORM` | Equivalent to `EPOLLIN`  
`EPOLLRDBAND` | Priority data band can be read.  
`EPOLLWRNORM` | Equivalent to `EPOLLOUT`  
`EPOLLWRBAND` | Priority data may be written.  
`EPOLLMSG` | Ignored.  
New in version 3.6: `EPOLLEXCLUSIVE` was added. It’s only supported by Linux
Kernel 4.5 or later.

`epoll.close()`

    
Close the control file descriptor of the epoll object.

`epoll.closed`

    
`True` if the epoll object is closed.

`epoll.fileno()`

    
Return the file descriptor number of the control fd.

`epoll.fromfd(fd)`

    
Create an epoll object from a given file descriptor.

`epoll.register(fd[, eventmask])`

    
Register a fd descriptor with the epoll object.

`epoll.modify(fd, eventmask)`

    
Modify a registered file descriptor.

`epoll.unregister(fd)`

    
Remove a registered file descriptor from the epoll object.

Changed in version 3.9: The method no longer ignores the `EBADF` error.

`epoll.poll(timeout=None, maxevents=-1)`

    
Wait for events. timeout in seconds (float)

Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with a recomputed timeout
when interrupted by a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception
(see PEP 475 for the rationale), instead of raising `InterruptedError`.

## Polling Objects

The `poll()` system call, supported on most Unix systems, provides better
scalability for network servers that service many, many clients at the same
time. `poll()` scales better because the system call only requires listing the
file descriptors of interest, while `select()` builds a bitmap, turns on bits
for the fds of interest, and then afterward the whole bitmap has to be
linearly scanned again. `select()` is O(highest file descriptor), while
`poll()` is O(number of file descriptors).

`poll.register(fd[, eventmask])`

    
Register a file descriptor with the polling object. Future calls to the
`poll()` method will then check whether the file descriptor has any pending
I/O events. fd can be either an integer, or an object with a `fileno()` method
that returns an integer. File objects implement `fileno()`, so they can also
be used as the argument.

eventmask is an optional bitmask describing the type of events you want to
check for, and can be a combination of the constants `POLLIN`, `POLLPRI`, and
`POLLOUT`, described in the table below. If not specified, the default value
used will check for all 3 types of events.

Constant | Meaning  
---|---  
`POLLIN` | There is data to read  
`POLLPRI` | There is urgent data to read  
`POLLOUT` | Ready for output: writing will not block  
`POLLERR` | Error condition of some sort  
`POLLHUP` | Hung up  
`POLLRDHUP` | Stream socket peer closed connection, or shut down writing half of connection  
`POLLNVAL` | Invalid request: descriptor not open  
Registering a file descriptor that’s already registered is not an error, and
has the same effect as registering the descriptor exactly once.

`poll.modify(fd, eventmask)`

    
Modifies an already registered fd. This has the same effect as `register(fd,
eventmask)`. Attempting to modify a file descriptor that was never registered
causes an `OSError` exception with errno `ENOENT` to be raised.

`poll.unregister(fd)`

    
Remove a file descriptor being tracked by a polling object. Just like the
`register()` method, fd can be an integer or an object with a `fileno()`
method that returns an integer.

Attempting to remove a file descriptor that was never registered causes a
`KeyError` exception to be raised.

`poll.poll([timeout])`

    
Polls the set of registered file descriptors, and returns a possibly-empty
list containing `(fd, event)` 2-tuples for the descriptors that have events or
errors to report. fd is the file descriptor, and event is a bitmask with bits
set for the reported events for that descriptor — `POLLIN` for waiting input,
`POLLOUT` to indicate that the descriptor can be written to, and so forth. An
empty list indicates that the call timed out and no file descriptors had any
events to report. If timeout is given, it specifies the length of time in
milliseconds which the system will wait for events before returning. If
timeout is omitted, negative, or `None`, the call will block until there is an
event for this poll object.

Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with a recomputed timeout
when interrupted by a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception
(see PEP 475 for the rationale), instead of raising `InterruptedError`.

## Kqueue Objects

`kqueue.close()`

    
Close the control file descriptor of the kqueue object.

`kqueue.closed`

    
`True` if the kqueue object is closed.

`kqueue.fileno()`

    
Return the file descriptor number of the control fd.

`kqueue.fromfd(fd)`

    
Create a kqueue object from a given file descriptor.

`kqueue.control(changelist, max_events[, timeout]) → eventlist`

    
Low level interface to kevent

  * changelist must be an iterable of kevent objects or `None`
  * max_events must be 0 or a positive integer
  * timeout in seconds (floats possible); the default is `None`, to wait forever

Changed in version 3.5: The function is now retried with a recomputed timeout
when interrupted by a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception
(see PEP 475 for the rationale), instead of raising `InterruptedError`.

## Kevent Objects

https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=kqueue&sektion=2

`kevent.ident`

    
Value used to identify the event. The interpretation depends on the filter but
it’s usually the file descriptor. In the constructor ident can either be an
int or an object with a `fileno()` method. kevent stores the integer
internally.
