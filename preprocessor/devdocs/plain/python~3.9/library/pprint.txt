# pprint — Data pretty printer

Source code: Lib/pprint.py

The `pprint` module provides a capability to “pretty-print” arbitrary Python
data structures in a form which can be used as input to the interpreter. If
the formatted structures include objects which are not fundamental Python
types, the representation may not be loadable. This may be the case if objects
such as files, sockets or classes are included, as well as many other objects
which are not representable as Python literals.

The formatted representation keeps objects on a single line if it can, and
breaks them onto multiple lines if they don’t fit within the allowed width.
Construct `PrettyPrinter` objects explicitly if you need to adjust the width
constraint.

Dictionaries are sorted by key before the display is computed.

Changed in version 3.9: Added support for pretty-printing
`types.SimpleNamespace`.

The `pprint` module defines one class:

`class pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=1, width=80, depth=None, stream=None, *,
compact=False, sort_dicts=True)`

    
Construct a `PrettyPrinter` instance. This constructor understands several
keyword parameters. An output stream may be set using the stream keyword; the
only method used on the stream object is the file protocol’s `write()` method.
If not specified, the `PrettyPrinter` adopts `sys.stdout`. The amount of
indentation added for each recursive level is specified by indent; the default
is one. Other values can cause output to look a little odd, but can make
nesting easier to spot. The number of levels which may be printed is
controlled by depth; if the data structure being printed is too deep, the next
contained level is replaced by `...`. By default, there is no constraint on
the depth of the objects being formatted. The desired output width is
constrained using the width parameter; the default is 80 characters. If a
structure cannot be formatted within the constrained width, a best effort will
be made. If compact is false (the default) each item of a long sequence will
be formatted on a separate line. If compact is true, as many items as will fit
within the width will be formatted on each output line. If sort_dicts is true
(the default), dictionaries will be formatted with their keys sorted,
otherwise they will display in insertion order.

Changed in version 3.4: Added the compact parameter.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the sort_dicts parameter.

    
    >>> import pprint
    >>> stuff = ['spam', 'eggs', 'lumberjack', 'knights', 'ni']
    >>> stuff.insert(0, stuff[:])
    >>> pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4)
    >>> pp.pprint(stuff)
    [   ['spam', 'eggs', 'lumberjack', 'knights', 'ni'],
        'spam',
        'eggs',
        'lumberjack',
        'knights',
        'ni']
    >>> pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(width=41, compact=True)
    >>> pp.pprint(stuff)
    [['spam', 'eggs', 'lumberjack',
      'knights', 'ni'],
     'spam', 'eggs', 'lumberjack', 'knights',
     'ni']
    >>> tup = ('spam', ('eggs', ('lumberjack', ('knights', ('ni', ('dead',
    ... ('parrot', ('fresh fruit',))))))))
    >>> pp = pprint.PrettyPrinter(depth=6)
    >>> pp.pprint(tup)
    ('spam', ('eggs', ('lumberjack', ('knights', ('ni', ('dead', (...)))))))
    
The `pprint` module also provides several shortcut functions:

`pprint.pformat(object, indent=1, width=80, depth=None, *, compact=False,
sort_dicts=True)`

    
Return the formatted representation of object as a string. indent, width,
depth, compact and sort_dicts will be passed to the `PrettyPrinter`
constructor as formatting parameters.

Changed in version 3.4: Added the compact parameter.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the sort_dicts parameter.

`pprint.pp(object, *args, sort_dicts=False, **kwargs)`

    
Prints the formatted representation of object followed by a newline. If
sort_dicts is false (the default), dictionaries will be displayed with their
keys in insertion order, otherwise the dict keys will be sorted. args and
kwargs will be passed to `pprint()` as formatting parameters.

New in version 3.8.

`pprint.pprint(object, stream=None, indent=1, width=80, depth=None, *,
compact=False, sort_dicts=True)`

    
Prints the formatted representation of object on stream, followed by a
newline. If stream is `None`, `sys.stdout` is used. This may be used in the
interactive interpreter instead of the `print()` function for inspecting
values (you can even reassign `print = pprint.pprint` for use within a scope).
indent, width, depth, compact and sort_dicts will be passed to the
`PrettyPrinter` constructor as formatting parameters.

Changed in version 3.4: Added the compact parameter.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the sort_dicts parameter.

    
    >>> import pprint
    >>> stuff = ['spam', 'eggs', 'lumberjack', 'knights', 'ni']
    >>> stuff.insert(0, stuff)
    >>> pprint.pprint(stuff)
    [<Recursion on list with id=...>,
     'spam',
     'eggs',
     'lumberjack',
     'knights',
     'ni']
    
`pprint.isreadable(object)`

    
Determine if the formatted representation of object is “readable”, or can be
used to reconstruct the value using `eval()`. This always returns `False` for
recursive objects.

    
    >>> pprint.isreadable(stuff)
    False
    
`pprint.isrecursive(object)`

    
Determine if object requires a recursive representation.

One more support function is also defined:

`pprint.saferepr(object)`

    
Return a string representation of object, protected against recursive data
structures. If the representation of object exposes a recursive entry, the
recursive reference will be represented as `<Recursion on typename with
id=number>`. The representation is not otherwise formatted.

    
    >>> pprint.saferepr(stuff)
    "[<Recursion on list with id=...>, 'spam', 'eggs', 'lumberjack', 'knights', 'ni']"
    
## PrettyPrinter Objects

`PrettyPrinter` instances have the following methods:

`PrettyPrinter.pformat(object)`

    
Return the formatted representation of object. This takes into account the
options passed to the `PrettyPrinter` constructor.

`PrettyPrinter.pprint(object)`

    
Print the formatted representation of object on the configured stream,
followed by a newline.

The following methods provide the implementations for the corresponding
functions of the same names. Using these methods on an instance is slightly
more efficient since new `PrettyPrinter` objects don’t need to be created.

`PrettyPrinter.isreadable(object)`

    
Determine if the formatted representation of the object is “readable,” or can
be used to reconstruct the value using `eval()`. Note that this returns
`False` for recursive objects. If the depth parameter of the `PrettyPrinter`
is set and the object is deeper than allowed, this returns `False`.

`PrettyPrinter.isrecursive(object)`

    
Determine if the object requires a recursive representation.

This method is provided as a hook to allow subclasses to modify the way
objects are converted to strings. The default implementation uses the
internals of the `saferepr()` implementation.

`PrettyPrinter.format(object, context, maxlevels, level)`

    
Returns three values: the formatted version of object as a string, a flag
indicating whether the result is readable, and a flag indicating whether
recursion was detected. The first argument is the object to be presented. The
second is a dictionary which contains the `id()` of objects that are part of
the current presentation context (direct and indirect containers for object
that are affecting the presentation) as the keys; if an object needs to be
presented which is already represented in context, the third return value
should be `True`. Recursive calls to the `format()` method should add
additional entries for containers to this dictionary. The third argument,
maxlevels, gives the requested limit to recursion; this will be `0` if there
is no requested limit. This argument should be passed unmodified to recursive
calls. The fourth argument, level, gives the current level; recursive calls
should be passed a value less than that of the current call.

## Example

To demonstrate several uses of the `pprint()` function and its parameters,
let’s fetch information about a project from PyPI:

    
    >>> import json
    >>> import pprint
    >>> from urllib.request import urlopen
    >>> with urlopen('https://pypi.org/pypi/sampleproject/json') as resp:
    ...     project_info = json.load(resp)['info']
    
In its basic form, `pprint()` shows the whole object:

    
    >>> pprint.pprint(project_info)

The result can be limited to a certain depth (ellipsis is used for deeper
contents):

    
    >>> pprint.pprint(project_info, depth=1)

Additionally, maximum character width can be suggested. If a long object
cannot be split, the specified width will be exceeded:
