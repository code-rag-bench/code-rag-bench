# gc — Garbage Collector interface

This module provides an interface to the optional garbage collector. It
provides the ability to disable the collector, tune the collection frequency,
and set debugging options. It also provides access to unreachable objects that
the collector found but cannot free. Since the collector supplements the
reference counting already used in Python, you can disable the collector if
you are sure your program does not create reference cycles. Automatic
collection can be disabled by calling `gc.disable()`. To debug a leaking
program call `gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_LEAK)`. Notice that this includes
`gc.DEBUG_SAVEALL`, causing garbage-collected objects to be saved in
gc.garbage for inspection.

The `gc` module provides the following functions:

`gc.enable()`

    
Enable automatic garbage collection.

`gc.disable()`

    
Disable automatic garbage collection.

`gc.isenabled()`

    
Return `True` if automatic collection is enabled.

`gc.collect(generation=2)`

    
With no arguments, run a full collection. The optional argument generation may
be an integer specifying which generation to collect (from 0 to 2). A
`ValueError` is raised if the generation number is invalid. The number of
unreachable objects found is returned.

The free lists maintained for a number of built-in types are cleared whenever
a full collection or collection of the highest generation (2) is run. Not all
items in some free lists may be freed due to the particular implementation, in
particular `float`.

`gc.set_debug(flags)`

    
Set the garbage collection debugging flags. Debugging information will be
written to `sys.stderr`. See below for a list of debugging flags which can be
combined using bit operations to control debugging.

`gc.get_debug()`

    
Return the debugging flags currently set.

`gc.get_objects(generation=None)`

    
Returns a list of all objects tracked by the collector, excluding the list
returned. If generation is not None, return only the objects tracked by the
collector that are in that generation.

Changed in version 3.8: New generation parameter.

Raises an auditing event `gc.get_objects` with argument `generation`.

`gc.get_stats()`

    
Return a list of three per-generation dictionaries containing collection
statistics since interpreter start. The number of keys may change in the
future, but currently each dictionary will contain the following items:

  * `collections` is the number of times this generation was collected;
  * `collected` is the total number of objects collected inside this generation;
  * `uncollectable` is the total number of objects which were found to be uncollectable (and were therefore moved to the `garbage` list) inside this generation.

New in version 3.4.

`gc.set_threshold(threshold0[, threshold1[, threshold2]])`

    
Set the garbage collection thresholds (the collection frequency). Setting
threshold0 to zero disables collection.

The GC classifies objects into three generations depending on how many
collection sweeps they have survived. New objects are placed in the youngest
generation (generation `0`). If an object survives a collection it is moved
into the next older generation. Since generation `2` is the oldest generation,
objects in that generation remain there after a collection. In order to decide
when to run, the collector keeps track of the number object allocations and
deallocations since the last collection. When the number of allocations minus
the number of deallocations exceeds threshold0, collection starts. Initially
only generation `0` is examined. If generation `0` has been examined more than
threshold1 times since generation `1` has been examined, then generation `1`
is examined as well. With the third generation, things are a bit more
complicated, see Collecting the oldest generation for more information.

`gc.get_count()`

    
Return the current collection counts as a tuple of `(count0, count1, count2)`.

`gc.get_threshold()`

    
Return the current collection thresholds as a tuple of `(threshold0,
threshold1, threshold2)`.

`gc.get_referrers(*objs)`

    
Return the list of objects that directly refer to any of objs. This function
will only locate those containers which support garbage collection; extension
types which do refer to other objects but do not support garbage collection
will not be found.

Note that objects which have already been dereferenced, but which live in
cycles and have not yet been collected by the garbage collector can be listed
among the resulting referrers. To get only currently live objects, call
`collect()` before calling `get_referrers()`.

Warning

Care must be taken when using objects returned by `get_referrers()` because
some of them could still be under construction and hence in a temporarily
invalid state. Avoid using `get_referrers()` for any purpose other than
debugging.

Raises an auditing event `gc.get_referrers` with argument `objs`.

`gc.get_referents(*objs)`

    
Return a list of objects directly referred to by any of the arguments. The
referents returned are those objects visited by the arguments’ C-level
`tp_traverse` methods (if any), and may not be all objects actually directly
reachable. `tp_traverse` methods are supported only by objects that support
garbage collection, and are only required to visit objects that may be
involved in a cycle. So, for example, if an integer is directly reachable from
an argument, that integer object may or may not appear in the result list.

Raises an auditing event `gc.get_referents` with argument `objs`.

`gc.is_tracked(obj)`

    
Returns `True` if the object is currently tracked by the garbage collector,
`False` otherwise. As a general rule, instances of atomic types aren’t tracked
and instances of non-atomic types (containers, user-defined objects…) are.
However, some type-specific optimizations can be present in order to suppress
the garbage collector footprint of simple instances (e.g. dicts containing
only atomic keys and values):

    
    >>> gc.is_tracked(0)
    False
    >>> gc.is_tracked("a")
    False
    >>> gc.is_tracked([])
    True
    >>> gc.is_tracked({})
    False
    >>> gc.is_tracked({"a": 1})
    False
    >>> gc.is_tracked({"a": []})
    True
    
New in version 3.1.

`gc.is_finalized(obj)`

    
Returns `True` if the given object has been finalized by the garbage
collector, `False` otherwise.

    
    >>> x = None
    >>> class Lazarus:
    ...     def __del__(self):
    ...         global x
    ...         x = self
    ...
    >>> lazarus = Lazarus()
    >>> gc.is_finalized(lazarus)
    False
    >>> del lazarus
    >>> gc.is_finalized(x)
    True
    
New in version 3.9.

`gc.freeze()`

    
Freeze all the objects tracked by gc - move them to a permanent generation and
ignore all the future collections. This can be used before a POSIX fork() call
to make the gc copy-on-write friendly or to speed up collection. Also
collection before a POSIX fork() call may free pages for future allocation
which can cause copy-on-write too so it’s advised to disable gc in parent
process and freeze before fork and enable gc in child process.

New in version 3.7.

`gc.unfreeze()`

    
Unfreeze the objects in the permanent generation, put them back into the
oldest generation.

New in version 3.7.

`gc.get_freeze_count()`

    
Return the number of objects in the permanent generation.

New in version 3.7.

The following variables are provided for read-only access (you can mutate the
values but should not rebind them):

`gc.garbage`

    
A list of objects which the collector found to be unreachable but could not be
freed (uncollectable objects). Starting with Python 3.4, this list should be
empty most of the time, except when using instances of C extension types with
a non-`NULL` `tp_del` slot.

If `DEBUG_SAVEALL` is set, then all unreachable objects will be added to this
list rather than freed.

Changed in version 3.2: If this list is non-empty at interpreter shutdown, a
`ResourceWarning` is emitted, which is silent by default. If
`DEBUG_UNCOLLECTABLE` is set, in addition all uncollectable objects are
printed.

Changed in version 3.4: Following PEP 442, objects with a `__del__()` method
don’t end up in `gc.garbage` anymore.

`gc.callbacks`

    
A list of callbacks that will be invoked by the garbage collector before and
after collection. The callbacks will be called with two arguments, phase and
info.

phase can be one of two values:

“start”: The garbage collection is about to start.

“stop”: The garbage collection has finished.

info is a dict providing more information for the callback. The following keys
are currently defined:

“generation”: The oldest generation being collected.

“collected”: When phase is “stop”, the number of objects successfully
collected.

“uncollectable”: When phase is “stop”, the number of objects that could not be
collected and were put in `garbage`.

Applications can add their own callbacks to this list. The primary use cases
are:

Gathering statistics about garbage collection, such as how often various
generations are collected, and how long the collection takes.

Allowing applications to identify and clear their own uncollectable types when
they appear in `garbage`.

New in version 3.3.

The following constants are provided for use with `set_debug()`:

`gc.DEBUG_STATS`

    
Print statistics during collection. This information can be useful when tuning
the collection frequency.

`gc.DEBUG_COLLECTABLE`

    
Print information on collectable objects found.

`gc.DEBUG_UNCOLLECTABLE`

    
Print information of uncollectable objects found (objects which are not
reachable but cannot be freed by the collector). These objects will be added
to the `garbage` list.

Changed in version 3.2: Also print the contents of the `garbage` list at
interpreter shutdown, if it isn’t empty.

`gc.DEBUG_SAVEALL`

    
When set, all unreachable objects found will be appended to garbage rather
than being freed. This can be useful for debugging a leaking program.

`gc.DEBUG_LEAK`

    
The debugging flags necessary for the collector to print information about a leaking program (equal to `DEBUG_COLLECTABLE | DEBUG_UNCOLLECTABLE | DEBUG_SAVEALL`).
