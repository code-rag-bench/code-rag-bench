# binascii — Convert between binary and ASCII

The `binascii` module contains a number of methods to convert between binary
and various ASCII-encoded binary representations. Normally, you will not use
these functions directly but use wrapper modules like `uu`, `base64`, or
`binhex` instead. The `binascii` module contains low-level functions written
in C for greater speed that are used by the higher-level modules.

Note

`a2b_*` functions accept Unicode strings containing only ASCII characters.
Other functions only accept bytes-like objects (such as `bytes`, `bytearray`
and other objects that support the buffer protocol).

Changed in version 3.3: ASCII-only unicode strings are now accepted by the
`a2b_*` functions.

The `binascii` module defines the following functions:

`binascii.a2b_uu(string)`

    
Convert a single line of uuencoded data back to binary and return the binary
data. Lines normally contain 45 (binary) bytes, except for the last line. Line
data may be followed by whitespace.

`binascii.b2a_uu(data, *, backtick=False)`

    
Convert binary data to a line of ASCII characters, the return value is the
converted line, including a newline char. The length of data should be at most
45. If backtick is true, zeros are represented by `'`'` instead of spaces.

Changed in version 3.7: Added the backtick parameter.

`binascii.a2b_base64(string)`

    
Convert a block of base64 data back to binary and return the binary data. More
than one line may be passed at a time.

`binascii.b2a_base64(data, *, newline=True)`

    
Convert binary data to a line of ASCII characters in base64 coding. The return
value is the converted line, including a newline char if newline is true. The
output of this function conforms to RFC 3548.

Changed in version 3.6: Added the newline parameter.

`binascii.a2b_qp(data, header=False)`

    
Convert a block of quoted-printable data back to binary and return the binary
data. More than one line may be passed at a time. If the optional argument
header is present and true, underscores will be decoded as spaces.

`binascii.b2a_qp(data, quotetabs=False, istext=True, header=False)`

    
Convert binary data to a line(s) of ASCII characters in quoted-printable
encoding. The return value is the converted line(s). If the optional argument
quotetabs is present and true, all tabs and spaces will be encoded. If the
optional argument istext is present and true, newlines are not encoded but
trailing whitespace will be encoded. If the optional argument header is
present and true, spaces will be encoded as underscores per RFC 1522. If the
optional argument header is present and false, newline characters will be
encoded as well; otherwise linefeed conversion might corrupt the binary data
stream.

`binascii.a2b_hqx(string)`

    
Convert binhex4 formatted ASCII data to binary, without doing RLE-
decompression. The string should contain a complete number of binary bytes, or
(in case of the last portion of the binhex4 data) have the remaining bits
zero.

Deprecated since version 3.9.

`binascii.rledecode_hqx(data)`

    
Perform RLE-decompression on the data, as per the binhex4 standard. The
algorithm uses `0x90` after a byte as a repeat indicator, followed by a count.
A count of `0` specifies a byte value of `0x90`. The routine returns the
decompressed data, unless data input data ends in an orphaned repeat
indicator, in which case the `Incomplete` exception is raised.

Changed in version 3.2: Accept only bytestring or bytearray objects as input.

Deprecated since version 3.9.

`binascii.rlecode_hqx(data)`

    
Perform binhex4 style RLE-compression on data and return the result.

Deprecated since version 3.9.

`binascii.b2a_hqx(data)`

    
Perform hexbin4 binary-to-ASCII translation and return the resulting string.
The argument should already be RLE-coded, and have a length divisible by 3
(except possibly the last fragment).

Deprecated since version 3.9.

`binascii.crc_hqx(data, value)`

    
Compute a 16-bit CRC value of data, starting with value as the initial CRC,
and return the result. This uses the CRC-CCITT polynomial x16 \+ x12 \+ x5 \+
1, often represented as 0x1021. This CRC is used in the binhex4 format.

`binascii.crc32(data[, value])`

    
Compute CRC-32, the 32-bit checksum of data, starting with an initial CRC of
value. The default initial CRC is zero. The algorithm is consistent with the
ZIP file checksum. Since the algorithm is designed for use as a checksum
algorithm, it is not suitable for use as a general hash algorithm. Use as
follows:

    
    print(binascii.crc32(b"hello world"))
    # Or, in two pieces:
    crc = binascii.crc32(b"hello")
    crc = binascii.crc32(b" world", crc)
    print('crc32 = {:#010x}'.format(crc))
    
Changed in version 3.0: The result is always unsigned. To generate the same
numeric value across all Python versions and platforms, use `crc32(data) &
0xffffffff`.

`binascii.b2a_hex(data[, sep[, bytes_per_sep=1]])`

`binascii.hexlify(data[, sep[, bytes_per_sep=1]])`

    
Return the hexadecimal representation of the binary data. Every byte of data
is converted into the corresponding 2-digit hex representation. The returned
bytes object is therefore twice as long as the length of data.

Similar functionality (but returning a text string) is also conveniently
accessible using the `bytes.hex()` method.

If sep is specified, it must be a single character str or bytes object. It
will be inserted in the output after every bytes_per_sep input bytes.
Separator placement is counted from the right end of the output by default, if
you wish to count from the left, supply a negative bytes_per_sep value.

    
    >>> import binascii
    >>> binascii.b2a_hex(b'\xb9\x01\xef')
    b'b901ef'
    >>> binascii.hexlify(b'\xb9\x01\xef', '-')
    b'b9-01-ef'
    >>> binascii.b2a_hex(b'\xb9\x01\xef', b'_', 2)
    b'b9_01ef'
    >>> binascii.b2a_hex(b'\xb9\x01\xef', b' ', -2)
    b'b901 ef'
    
Changed in version 3.8: The sep and bytes_per_sep parameters were added.

`binascii.a2b_hex(hexstr)`

`binascii.unhexlify(hexstr)`

    
Return the binary data represented by the hexadecimal string hexstr. This
function is the inverse of `b2a_hex()`. hexstr must contain an even number of
hexadecimal digits (which can be upper or lower case), otherwise an `Error`
exception is raised.

Similar functionality (accepting only text string arguments, but more liberal
towards whitespace) is also accessible using the `bytes.fromhex()` class
method.

`exception binascii.Error`

    
Exception raised on errors. These are usually programming errors.

`exception binascii.Incomplete`

    
Exception raised on incomplete data. These are usually not programming errors,
but may be handled by reading a little more data and trying again.
