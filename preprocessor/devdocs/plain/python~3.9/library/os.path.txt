# os.path — Common pathname manipulations

Source code: Lib/posixpath.py (for POSIX) and Lib/ntpath.py (for Windows NT).

This module implements some useful functions on pathnames. To read or write
files see `open()`, and for accessing the filesystem see the `os` module. The
path parameters can be passed as either strings, or bytes. Applications are
encouraged to represent file names as (Unicode) character strings.
Unfortunately, some file names may not be representable as strings on Unix, so
applications that need to support arbitrary file names on Unix should use
bytes objects to represent path names. Vice versa, using bytes objects cannot
represent all file names on Windows (in the standard `mbcs` encoding), hence
Windows applications should use string objects to access all files.

Unlike a unix shell, Python does not do any automatic path expansions.
Functions such as `expanduser()` and `expandvars()` can be invoked explicitly
when an application desires shell-like path expansion. (See also the `glob`
module.)

See also

The `pathlib` module offers high-level path objects.

Note

All of these functions accept either only bytes or only string objects as
their parameters. The result is an object of the same type, if a path or file
name is returned.

Note

Since different operating systems have different path name conventions, there
are several versions of this module in the standard library. The `os.path`
module is always the path module suitable for the operating system Python is
running on, and therefore usable for local paths. However, you can also import
and use the individual modules if you want to manipulate a path that is always
in one of the different formats. They all have the same interface:

  * `posixpath` for UNIX-style paths
  * `ntpath` for Windows paths

Changed in version 3.8: `exists()`, `lexists()`, `isdir()`, `isfile()`,
`islink()`, and `ismount()` now return `False` instead of raising an exception
for paths that contain characters or bytes unrepresentable at the OS level.

`os.path.abspath(path)`

    
Return a normalized absolutized version of the pathname path. On most
platforms, this is equivalent to calling the function `normpath()` as follows:
`normpath(join(os.getcwd(), path))`.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.basename(path)`

    
Return the base name of pathname path. This is the second element of the pair
returned by passing path to the function `split()`. Note that the result of
this function is different from the Unix basename program; where basename for
`'/foo/bar/'` returns `'bar'`, the `basename()` function returns an empty
string (`''`).

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.commonpath(paths)`

    
Return the longest common sub-path of each pathname in the sequence paths.
Raise `ValueError` if paths contain both absolute and relative pathnames, the
paths are on the different drives or if paths is empty. Unlike
`commonprefix()`, this returns a valid path.

Availability: Unix, Windows.

New in version 3.5.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a sequence of path-like objects.

`os.path.commonprefix(list)`

    
Return the longest path prefix (taken character-by-character) that is a prefix
of all paths in list. If list is empty, return the empty string (`''`).

Note

This function may return invalid paths because it works a character at a time.
To obtain a valid path, see `commonpath()`.

    
    >>> os.path.commonprefix(['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])
    '/usr/l'
    
    >>> os.path.commonpath(['/usr/lib', '/usr/local/lib'])
    '/usr'
    
Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.dirname(path)`

    
Return the directory name of pathname path. This is the first element of the
pair returned by passing path to the function `split()`.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.exists(path)`

    
Return `True` if path refers to an existing path or an open file descriptor.
Returns `False` for broken symbolic links. On some platforms, this function
may return `False` if permission is not granted to execute `os.stat()` on the
requested file, even if the path physically exists.

Changed in version 3.3: path can now be an integer: `True` is returned if it
is an open file descriptor, `False` otherwise.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.lexists(path)`

    
Return `True` if path refers to an existing path. Returns `True` for broken
symbolic links. Equivalent to `exists()` on platforms lacking `os.lstat()`.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.expanduser(path)`

    
On Unix and Windows, return the argument with an initial component of `~` or
`~user` replaced by that user’s home directory.

On Unix, an initial `~` is replaced by the environment variable `HOME` if it
is set; otherwise the current user’s home directory is looked up in the
password directory through the built-in module `pwd`. An initial `~user` is
looked up directly in the password directory.

On Windows, `USERPROFILE` will be used if set, otherwise a combination of
`HOMEPATH` and `HOMEDRIVE` will be used. An initial `~user` is handled by
stripping the last directory component from the created user path derived
above.

If the expansion fails or if the path does not begin with a tilde, the path is
returned unchanged.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

Changed in version 3.8: No longer uses `HOME` on Windows.

`os.path.expandvars(path)`

    
Return the argument with environment variables expanded. Substrings of the
form `$name` or `${name}` are replaced by the value of environment variable
name. Malformed variable names and references to non-existing variables are
left unchanged.

On Windows, `%name%` expansions are supported in addition to `$name` and
`${name}`.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.getatime(path)`

    
Return the time of last access of path. The return value is a floating point
number giving the number of seconds since the epoch (see the `time` module).
Raise `OSError` if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.

`os.path.getmtime(path)`

    
Return the time of last modification of path. The return value is a floating
point number giving the number of seconds since the epoch (see the `time`
module). Raise `OSError` if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.getctime(path)`

    
Return the system’s ctime which, on some systems (like Unix) is the time of
the last metadata change, and, on others (like Windows), is the creation time
for path. The return value is a number giving the number of seconds since the
epoch (see the `time` module). Raise `OSError` if the file does not exist or
is inaccessible.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.getsize(path)`

    
Return the size, in bytes, of path. Raise `OSError` if the file does not exist
or is inaccessible.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.isabs(path)`

    
Return `True` if path is an absolute pathname. On Unix, that means it begins
with a slash, on Windows that it begins with a (back)slash after chopping off
a potential drive letter.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.isfile(path)`

    
Return `True` if path is an `existing` regular file. This follows symbolic
links, so both `islink()` and `isfile()` can be true for the same path.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.isdir(path)`

    
Return `True` if path is an `existing` directory. This follows symbolic links,
so both `islink()` and `isdir()` can be true for the same path.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.islink(path)`

    
Return `True` if path refers to an `existing` directory entry that is a
symbolic link. Always `False` if symbolic links are not supported by the
Python runtime.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.ismount(path)`

    
Return `True` if pathname path is a mount point: a point in a file system
where a different file system has been mounted. On POSIX, the function checks
whether path’s parent, `path/..`, is on a different device than path, or
whether `path/..` and path point to the same i-node on the same device — this
should detect mount points for all Unix and POSIX variants. It is not able to
reliably detect bind mounts on the same filesystem. On Windows, a drive letter
root and a share UNC are always mount points, and for any other path
`GetVolumePathName` is called to see if it is different from the input path.

New in version 3.4: Support for detecting non-root mount points on Windows.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.join(path, *paths)`

    
Join one or more path components intelligently. The return value is the
concatenation of path and any members of *paths with exactly one directory
separator following each non-empty part except the last, meaning that the
result will only end in a separator if the last part is empty. If a component
is an absolute path, all previous components are thrown away and joining
continues from the absolute path component.

On Windows, the drive letter is not reset when an absolute path component
(e.g., `r'\foo'`) is encountered. If a component contains a drive letter, all
previous components are thrown away and the drive letter is reset. Note that
since there is a current directory for each drive, `os.path.join("c:", "foo")`
represents a path relative to the current directory on drive `C:` (`c:foo`),
not `c:\foo`.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object for path and paths.

`os.path.normcase(path)`

    
Normalize the case of a pathname. On Windows, convert all characters in the
pathname to lowercase, and also convert forward slashes to backward slashes.
On other operating systems, return the path unchanged.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.normpath(path)`

    
Normalize a pathname by collapsing redundant separators and up-level
references so that `A//B`, `A/B/`, `A/./B` and `A/foo/../B` all become `A/B`.
This string manipulation may change the meaning of a path that contains
symbolic links. On Windows, it converts forward slashes to backward slashes.
To normalize case, use `normcase()`.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.realpath(path)`

    
Return the canonical path of the specified filename, eliminating any symbolic
links encountered in the path (if they are supported by the operating system).

Note

When symbolic link cycles occur, the returned path will be one member of the
cycle, but no guarantee is made about which member that will be.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

Changed in version 3.8: Symbolic links and junctions are now resolved on
Windows.

`os.path.relpath(path, start=os.curdir)`

    
Return a relative filepath to path either from the current directory or from
an optional start directory. This is a path computation: the filesystem is not
accessed to confirm the existence or nature of path or start. On Windows,
`ValueError` is raised when path and start are on different drives.

start defaults to `os.curdir`.

Availability: Unix, Windows.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.samefile(path1, path2)`

    
Return `True` if both pathname arguments refer to the same file or directory.
This is determined by the device number and i-node number and raises an
exception if an `os.stat()` call on either pathname fails.

Availability: Unix, Windows.

Changed in version 3.2: Added Windows support.

Changed in version 3.4: Windows now uses the same implementation as all other
platforms.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.sameopenfile(fp1, fp2)`

    
Return `True` if the file descriptors fp1 and fp2 refer to the same file.

Availability: Unix, Windows.

Changed in version 3.2: Added Windows support.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.samestat(stat1, stat2)`

    
Return `True` if the stat tuples stat1 and stat2 refer to the same file. These
structures may have been returned by `os.fstat()`, `os.lstat()`, or
`os.stat()`. This function implements the underlying comparison used by
`samefile()` and `sameopenfile()`.

Availability: Unix, Windows.

Changed in version 3.4: Added Windows support.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.split(path)`

    
Split the pathname path into a pair, `(head, tail)` where tail is the last
pathname component and head is everything leading up to that. The tail part
will never contain a slash; if path ends in a slash, tail will be empty. If
there is no slash in path, head will be empty. If path is empty, both head and
tail are empty. Trailing slashes are stripped from head unless it is the root
(one or more slashes only). In all cases, `join(head, tail)` returns a path to
the same location as path (but the strings may differ). Also see the functions
`dirname()` and `basename()`.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.splitdrive(path)`

    
Split the pathname path into a pair `(drive, tail)` where drive is either a
mount point or the empty string. On systems which do not use drive
specifications, drive will always be the empty string. In all cases, `drive +
tail` will be the same as path.

On Windows, splits a pathname into drive/UNC sharepoint and relative path.

If the path contains a drive letter, drive will contain everything up to and
including the colon. e.g. `splitdrive("c:/dir")` returns `("c:", "/dir")`

If the path contains a UNC path, drive will contain the host name and share,
up to but not including the fourth separator. e.g.
`splitdrive("//host/computer/dir")` returns `("//host/computer", "/dir")`

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.splitext(path)`

    
Split the pathname path into a pair `(root, ext)` such that `root + ext ==
path`, and ext is empty or begins with a period and contains at most one
period. Leading periods on the basename are ignored; `splitext('.cshrc')`
returns `('.cshrc', '')`.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`os.path.supports_unicode_filenames`

    
`True` if arbitrary Unicode strings can be used as file names (within
limitations imposed by the file system).
