# platform — Access to underlying platform’s identifying data

Source code: Lib/platform.py

Note

Specific platforms listed alphabetically, with Linux included in the Unix
section.

## Cross Platform

`platform.architecture(executable=sys.executable, bits='', linkage='')`

    
Queries the given executable (defaults to the Python interpreter binary) for
various architecture information.

Returns a tuple `(bits, linkage)` which contain information about the bit
architecture and the linkage format used for the executable. Both values are
returned as strings.

Values that cannot be determined are returned as given by the parameter
presets. If bits is given as `''`, the `sizeof(pointer)` (or `sizeof(long)` on
Python version < 1.5.2) is used as indicator for the supported pointer size.

The function relies on the system’s `file` command to do the actual work. This
is available on most if not all Unix platforms and some non-Unix platforms and
then only if the executable points to the Python interpreter. Reasonable
defaults are used when the above needs are not met.

Note

On Mac OS X (and perhaps other platforms), executable files may be universal
files containing multiple architectures.

To get at the “64-bitness” of the current interpreter, it is more reliable to
query the `sys.maxsize` attribute:

    
    is_64bits = sys.maxsize > 2**32
    
`platform.machine()`

    
Returns the machine type, e.g. `'i386'`. An empty string is returned if the
value cannot be determined.

`platform.node()`

    
Returns the computer’s network name (may not be fully qualified!). An empty
string is returned if the value cannot be determined.

`platform.platform(aliased=0, terse=0)`

    
Returns a single string identifying the underlying platform with as much
useful information as possible.

The output is intended to be human readable rather than machine parseable. It
may look different on different platforms and this is intended.

If aliased is true, the function will use aliases for various platforms that
report system names which differ from their common names, for example SunOS
will be reported as Solaris. The `system_alias()` function is used to
implement this.

Setting terse to true causes the function to return only the absolute minimum
information needed to identify the platform.

Changed in version 3.8: On macOS, the function now uses `mac_ver()`, if it
returns a non-empty release string, to get the macOS version rather than the
darwin version.

`platform.processor()`

    
Returns the (real) processor name, e.g. `'amdk6'`.

An empty string is returned if the value cannot be determined. Note that many
platforms do not provide this information or simply return the same value as
for `machine()`. NetBSD does this.

`platform.python_build()`

    
Returns a tuple `(buildno, builddate)` stating the Python build number and
date as strings.

`platform.python_compiler()`

    
Returns a string identifying the compiler used for compiling Python.

`platform.python_branch()`

    
Returns a string identifying the Python implementation SCM branch.

`platform.python_implementation()`

    
Returns a string identifying the Python implementation. Possible return values
are: ‘CPython’, ‘IronPython’, ‘Jython’, ‘PyPy’.

`platform.python_revision()`

    
Returns a string identifying the Python implementation SCM revision.

`platform.python_version()`

    
Returns the Python version as string `'major.minor.patchlevel'`.

Note that unlike the Python `sys.version`, the returned value will always
include the patchlevel (it defaults to 0).

`platform.python_version_tuple()`

    
Returns the Python version as tuple `(major, minor, patchlevel)` of strings.

Note that unlike the Python `sys.version`, the returned value will always
include the patchlevel (it defaults to `'0'`).

`platform.release()`

    
Returns the system’s release, e.g. `'2.2.0'` or `'NT'` An empty string is
returned if the value cannot be determined.

`platform.system()`

    
Returns the system/OS name, such as `'Linux'`, `'Darwin'`, `'Java'`,
`'Windows'`. An empty string is returned if the value cannot be determined.

`platform.system_alias(system, release, version)`

    
Returns `(system, release, version)` aliased to common marketing names used
for some systems. It also does some reordering of the information in some
cases where it would otherwise cause confusion.

`platform.version()`

    
Returns the system’s release version, e.g. `'#3 on degas'`. An empty string is
returned if the value cannot be determined.

`platform.uname()`

    
Fairly portable uname interface. Returns a `namedtuple()` containing six
attributes: `system`, `node`, `release`, `version`, `machine`, and
`processor`.

Note that this adds a sixth attribute (`processor`) not present in the
`os.uname()` result. Also, the attribute names are different for the first two
attributes; `os.uname()` names them `sysname` and `nodename`.

Entries which cannot be determined are set to `''`.

Changed in version 3.3: Result changed from a tuple to a namedtuple.

## Java Platform

`platform.java_ver(release='', vendor='', vminfo=('', '', ''), osinfo=('', '',
''))`

    
Version interface for Jython.

Returns a tuple `(release, vendor, vminfo, osinfo)` with vminfo being a tuple
`(vm_name, vm_release, vm_vendor)` and osinfo being a tuple `(os_name,
os_version, os_arch)`. Values which cannot be determined are set to the
defaults given as parameters (which all default to `''`).

## Windows Platform

`platform.win32_ver(release='', version='', csd='', ptype='')`

    
Get additional version information from the Windows Registry and return a
tuple `(release, version, csd, ptype)` referring to OS release, version
number, CSD level (service pack) and OS type (multi/single processor).

As a hint: ptype is `'Uniprocessor Free'` on single processor NT machines and
`'Multiprocessor Free'` on multi processor machines. The ‘Free’ refers to the
OS version being free of debugging code. It could also state ‘Checked’ which
means the OS version uses debugging code, i.e. code that checks arguments,
ranges, etc.

`platform.win32_edition()`

    
Returns a string representing the current Windows edition. Possible values
include but are not limited to `'Enterprise'`, `'IoTUAP'`, `'ServerStandard'`,
and `'nanoserver'`.

New in version 3.8.

`platform.win32_is_iot()`

    
Return `True` if the Windows edition returned by `win32_edition()` is
recognized as an IoT edition.

New in version 3.8.

## Mac OS Platform

`platform.mac_ver(release='', versioninfo=('', '', ''), machine='')`

    
Get Mac OS version information and return it as tuple `(release, versioninfo,
machine)` with versioninfo being a tuple `(version, dev_stage,
non_release_version)`.

Entries which cannot be determined are set to `''`. All tuple entries are
strings.

## Unix Platforms

`platform.libc_ver(executable=sys.executable, lib='', version='',
chunksize=16384)`

    
Tries to determine the libc version against which the file executable
(defaults to the Python interpreter) is linked. Returns a tuple of strings
`(lib, version)` which default to the given parameters in case the lookup
fails.

Note that this function has intimate knowledge of how different libc versions
add symbols to the executable is probably only usable for executables compiled
using gcc.

The file is read and scanned in chunks of chunksize bytes.
