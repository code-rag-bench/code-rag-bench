# ssl — TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects

Source code: Lib/ssl.py

This module provides access to Transport Layer Security (often known as
“Secure Sockets Layer”) encryption and peer authentication facilities for
network sockets, both client-side and server-side. This module uses the
OpenSSL library. It is available on all modern Unix systems, Windows, Mac OS
X, and probably additional platforms, as long as OpenSSL is installed on that
platform.

Note

Some behavior may be platform dependent, since calls are made to the operating
system socket APIs. The installed version of OpenSSL may also cause variations
in behavior. For example, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 come with openssl version 1.0.1.

Warning

Don’t use this module without reading the Security considerations. Doing so
may lead to a false sense of security, as the default settings of the ssl
module are not necessarily appropriate for your application.

This section documents the objects and functions in the `ssl` module; for more
general information about TLS, SSL, and certificates, the reader is referred
to the documents in the “See Also” section at the bottom.

This module provides a class, `ssl.SSLSocket`, which is derived from the
`socket.socket` type, and provides a socket-like wrapper that also encrypts
and decrypts the data going over the socket with SSL. It supports additional
methods such as `getpeercert()`, which retrieves the certificate of the other
side of the connection, and `cipher()`, which retrieves the cipher being used
for the secure connection.

For more sophisticated applications, the `ssl.SSLContext` class helps manage
settings and certificates, which can then be inherited by SSL sockets created
through the `SSLContext.wrap_socket()` method.

Changed in version 3.5.3: Updated to support linking with OpenSSL 1.1.0

Changed in version 3.6: OpenSSL 0.9.8, 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 are deprecated and no
longer supported. In the future the ssl module will require at least OpenSSL
1.0.2 or 1.1.0.

## Functions, Constants, and Exceptions

### Socket creation

Since Python 3.2 and 2.7.9, it is recommended to use the
`SSLContext.wrap_socket()` of an `SSLContext` instance to wrap sockets as
`SSLSocket` objects. The helper functions `create_default_context()` returns a
new context with secure default settings. The old `wrap_socket()` function is
deprecated since it is both inefficient and has no support for server name
indication (SNI) and hostname matching.

Client socket example with default context and IPv4/IPv6 dual stack:

    
    import socket
    import ssl
    
    hostname = 'www.python.org'
    context = ssl.create_default_context()
    
    with socket.create_connection((hostname, 443)) as sock:
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=hostname) as ssock:
            print(ssock.version())
    
Client socket example with custom context and IPv4:

    
    hostname = 'www.python.org'
    # PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT requires valid cert chain and hostname
    context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
    context.load_verify_locations('path/to/cabundle.pem')
    
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0) as sock:
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_hostname=hostname) as ssock:
            print(ssock.version())
    
Server socket example listening on localhost IPv4:

    
    context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER)
    context.load_cert_chain('/path/to/certchain.pem', '/path/to/private.key')
    
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0) as sock:
        sock.bind(('127.0.0.1', 8443))
        sock.listen(5)
        with context.wrap_socket(sock, server_side=True) as ssock:
            conn, addr = ssock.accept()
            ...
    
### Context creation

A convenience function helps create `SSLContext` objects for common purposes.

`ssl.create_default_context(purpose=Purpose.SERVER_AUTH, cafile=None,
capath=None, cadata=None)`

    
Return a new `SSLContext` object with default settings for the given purpose.
The settings are chosen by the `ssl` module, and usually represent a higher
security level than when calling the `SSLContext` constructor directly.

cafile, capath, cadata represent optional CA certificates to trust for
certificate verification, as in `SSLContext.load_verify_locations()`. If all
three are `None`, this function can choose to trust the system’s default CA
certificates instead.

The settings are: `PROTOCOL_TLS`, `OP_NO_SSLv2`, and `OP_NO_SSLv3` with high
encryption cipher suites without RC4 and without unauthenticated cipher
suites. Passing `SERVER_AUTH` as purpose sets `verify_mode` to `CERT_REQUIRED`
and either loads CA certificates (when at least one of cafile, capath or
cadata is given) or uses `SSLContext.load_default_certs()` to load default CA
certificates.

When `keylog_filename` is supported and the environment variable
`SSLKEYLOGFILE` is set, `create_default_context()` enables key logging.

Note

The protocol, options, cipher and other settings may change to more
restrictive values anytime without prior deprecation. The values represent a
fair balance between compatibility and security.

If your application needs specific settings, you should create a `SSLContext`
and apply the settings yourself.

Note

If you find that when certain older clients or servers attempt to connect with
a `SSLContext` created by this function that they get an error stating
“Protocol or cipher suite mismatch”, it may be that they only support SSL3.0
which this function excludes using the `OP_NO_SSLv3`. SSL3.0 is widely
considered to be completely broken. If you still wish to continue to use this
function but still allow SSL 3.0 connections you can re-enable them using:

    
    ctx = ssl.create_default_context(Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH)
    ctx.options &= ~ssl.OP_NO_SSLv3
    
New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.4.4: RC4 was dropped from the default cipher string.

Changed in version 3.6: ChaCha20/Poly1305 was added to the default cipher
string.

3DES was dropped from the default cipher string.

Changed in version 3.8: Support for key logging to `SSLKEYLOGFILE` was added.

### Exceptions

`exception ssl.SSLError`

    
Raised to signal an error from the underlying SSL implementation (currently
provided by the OpenSSL library). This signifies some problem in the higher-
level encryption and authentication layer that’s superimposed on the
underlying network connection. This error is a subtype of `OSError`. The error
code and message of `SSLError` instances are provided by the OpenSSL library.

Changed in version 3.3: `SSLError` used to be a subtype of `socket.error`.

`library`

    
A string mnemonic designating the OpenSSL submodule in which the error
occurred, such as `SSL`, `PEM` or `X509`. The range of possible values depends
on the OpenSSL version.

New in version 3.3.

`reason`

    
A string mnemonic designating the reason this error occurred, for example
`CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`. The range of possible values depends on the
OpenSSL version.

New in version 3.3.

`exception ssl.SSLZeroReturnError`

    
A subclass of `SSLError` raised when trying to read or write and the SSL
connection has been closed cleanly. Note that this doesn’t mean that the
underlying transport (read TCP) has been closed.

New in version 3.3.

`exception ssl.SSLWantReadError`

    
A subclass of `SSLError` raised by a non-blocking SSL socket when trying to
read or write data, but more data needs to be received on the underlying TCP
transport before the request can be fulfilled.

New in version 3.3.

`exception ssl.SSLWantWriteError`

    
A subclass of `SSLError` raised by a non-blocking SSL socket when trying to
read or write data, but more data needs to be sent on the underlying TCP
transport before the request can be fulfilled.

New in version 3.3.

`exception ssl.SSLSyscallError`

    
A subclass of `SSLError` raised when a system error was encountered while
trying to fulfill an operation on a SSL socket. Unfortunately, there is no
easy way to inspect the original errno number.

New in version 3.3.

`exception ssl.SSLEOFError`

    
A subclass of `SSLError` raised when the SSL connection has been terminated
abruptly. Generally, you shouldn’t try to reuse the underlying transport when
this error is encountered.

New in version 3.3.

`exception ssl.SSLCertVerificationError`

    
A subclass of `SSLError` raised when certificate validation has failed.

New in version 3.7.

`verify_code`

    
A numeric error number that denotes the verification error.

`verify_message`

    
A human readable string of the verification error.

`exception ssl.CertificateError`

    
An alias for `SSLCertVerificationError`.

Changed in version 3.7: The exception is now an alias for
`SSLCertVerificationError`.

### Random generation

`ssl.RAND_bytes(num)`

    
Return num cryptographically strong pseudo-random bytes. Raises an `SSLError`
if the PRNG has not been seeded with enough data or if the operation is not
supported by the current RAND method. `RAND_status()` can be used to check the
status of the PRNG and `RAND_add()` can be used to seed the PRNG.

For almost all applications `os.urandom()` is preferable.

Read the Wikipedia article, Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number
generator (CSPRNG), to get the requirements of a cryptographically strong
generator.

New in version 3.3.

`ssl.RAND_pseudo_bytes(num)`

    
Return (bytes, is_cryptographic): bytes are num pseudo-random bytes,
is_cryptographic is `True` if the bytes generated are cryptographically
strong. Raises an `SSLError` if the operation is not supported by the current
RAND method.

Generated pseudo-random byte sequences will be unique if they are of
sufficient length, but are not necessarily unpredictable. They can be used for
non-cryptographic purposes and for certain purposes in cryptographic
protocols, but usually not for key generation etc.

For almost all applications `os.urandom()` is preferable.

New in version 3.3.

Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated
`ssl.RAND_pseudo_bytes()`, use `ssl.RAND_bytes()` instead.

`ssl.RAND_status()`

    
Return `True` if the SSL pseudo-random number generator has been seeded with
‘enough’ randomness, and `False` otherwise. You can use `ssl.RAND_egd()` and
`ssl.RAND_add()` to increase the randomness of the pseudo-random number
generator.

`ssl.RAND_egd(path)`

    
If you are running an entropy-gathering daemon (EGD) somewhere, and path is
the pathname of a socket connection open to it, this will read 256 bytes of
randomness from the socket, and add it to the SSL pseudo-random number
generator to increase the security of generated secret keys. This is typically
only necessary on systems without better sources of randomness.

See http://egd.sourceforge.net/ or http://prngd.sourceforge.net/ for sources
of entropy-gathering daemons.

Availability: not available with LibreSSL and OpenSSL > 1.1.0.

`ssl.RAND_add(bytes, entropy)`

    
Mix the given bytes into the SSL pseudo-random number generator. The parameter
entropy (a float) is a lower bound on the entropy contained in string (so you
can always use `0.0`). See RFC 1750 for more information on sources of
entropy.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.

### Certificate handling

`ssl.match_hostname(cert, hostname)`

    
Verify that cert (in decoded format as returned by `SSLSocket.getpeercert()`)
matches the given hostname. The rules applied are those for checking the
identity of HTTPS servers as outlined in RFC 2818, RFC 5280 and RFC 6125. In
addition to HTTPS, this function should be suitable for checking the identity
of servers in various SSL-based protocols such as FTPS, IMAPS, POPS and
others.

`CertificateError` is raised on failure. On success, the function returns
nothing:

    
    >>> cert = {'subject': ((('commonName', 'example.com'),),)}
    >>> ssl.match_hostname(cert, "example.com")
    >>> ssl.match_hostname(cert, "example.org")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
      File "/home/py3k/Lib/ssl.py", line 130, in match_hostname
    ssl.CertificateError: hostname 'example.org' doesn't match 'example.com'
    
New in version 3.2.

Changed in version 3.3.3: The function now follows RFC 6125, section 6.4.3 and
does neither match multiple wildcards (e.g. `*.*.com` or `*a*.example.org`)
nor a wildcard inside an internationalized domain names (IDN) fragment. IDN
A-labels such as `www*.xn--pthon-kva.org` are still supported, but
`x*.python.org` no longer matches `xn--tda.python.org`.

Changed in version 3.5: Matching of IP addresses, when present in the
subjectAltName field of the certificate, is now supported.

Changed in version 3.7: The function is no longer used to TLS connections.
Hostname matching is now performed by OpenSSL.

Allow wildcard when it is the leftmost and the only character in that segment.
Partial wildcards like `www*.example.com` are no longer supported.

Deprecated since version 3.7.

`ssl.cert_time_to_seconds(cert_time)`

    
Return the time in seconds since the Epoch, given the `cert_time` string
representing the “notBefore” or “notAfter” date from a certificate in `"%b %d
%H:%M:%S %Y %Z"` strptime format (C locale).

Here’s an example:

    
    >>> import ssl
    >>> timestamp = ssl.cert_time_to_seconds("Jan  5 09:34:43 2018 GMT")
    >>> timestamp  
    1515144883
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> print(datetime.utcfromtimestamp(timestamp))  
    2018-01-05 09:34:43
    
“notBefore” or “notAfter” dates must use GMT (RFC 5280).

Changed in version 3.5: Interpret the input time as a time in UTC as specified
by ‘GMT’ timezone in the input string. Local timezone was used previously.
Return an integer (no fractions of a second in the input format)

`ssl.get_server_certificate(addr, ssl_version=PROTOCOL_TLS, ca_certs=None)`

    
Given the address `addr` of an SSL-protected server, as a (hostname, port-
number) pair, fetches the server’s certificate, and returns it as a PEM-
encoded string. If `ssl_version` is specified, uses that version of the SSL
protocol to attempt to connect to the server. If `ca_certs` is specified, it
should be a file containing a list of root certificates, the same format as
used for the same parameter in `SSLContext.wrap_socket()`. The call will
attempt to validate the server certificate against that set of root
certificates, and will fail if the validation attempt fails.

Changed in version 3.3: This function is now IPv6-compatible.

Changed in version 3.5: The default ssl_version is changed from
`PROTOCOL_SSLv3` to `PROTOCOL_TLS` for maximum compatibility with modern
servers.

`ssl.DER_cert_to_PEM_cert(DER_cert_bytes)`

    
Given a certificate as a DER-encoded blob of bytes, returns a PEM-encoded
string version of the same certificate.

`ssl.PEM_cert_to_DER_cert(PEM_cert_string)`

    
Given a certificate as an ASCII PEM string, returns a DER-encoded sequence of
bytes for that same certificate.

`ssl.get_default_verify_paths()`

    
Returns a named tuple with paths to OpenSSL’s default cafile and capath. The
paths are the same as used by `SSLContext.set_default_verify_paths()`. The
return value is a named tuple `DefaultVerifyPaths`:

  * `cafile` \- resolved path to cafile or `None` if the file doesn’t exist,
  * `capath` \- resolved path to capath or `None` if the directory doesn’t exist,
  * `openssl_cafile_env` \- OpenSSL’s environment key that points to a cafile,
  * `openssl_cafile` \- hard coded path to a cafile,
  * `openssl_capath_env` \- OpenSSL’s environment key that points to a capath,
  * `openssl_capath` \- hard coded path to a capath directory

Availability: LibreSSL ignores the environment vars `openssl_cafile_env` and
`openssl_capath_env`.

New in version 3.4.

`ssl.enum_certificates(store_name)`

    
Retrieve certificates from Windows’ system cert store. store_name may be one
of `CA`, `ROOT` or `MY`. Windows may provide additional cert stores, too.

The function returns a list of (cert_bytes, encoding_type, trust) tuples. The
encoding_type specifies the encoding of cert_bytes. It is either `x509_asn`
for X.509 ASN.1 data or `pkcs_7_asn` for PKCS#7 ASN.1 data. Trust specifies
the purpose of the certificate as a set of OIDS or exactly `True` if the
certificate is trustworthy for all purposes.

Example:

    
    >>> ssl.enum_certificates("CA")
    [(b'data...', 'x509_asn', {'1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1', '1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2'}),
     (b'data...', 'x509_asn', True)]
    
Availability: Windows.

New in version 3.4.

`ssl.enum_crls(store_name)`

    
Retrieve CRLs from Windows’ system cert store. store_name may be one of `CA`,
`ROOT` or `MY`. Windows may provide additional cert stores, too.

The function returns a list of (cert_bytes, encoding_type, trust) tuples. The
encoding_type specifies the encoding of cert_bytes. It is either `x509_asn`
for X.509 ASN.1 data or `pkcs_7_asn` for PKCS#7 ASN.1 data.

Availability: Windows.

New in version 3.4.

`ssl.wrap_socket(sock, keyfile=None, certfile=None, server_side=False,
cert_reqs=CERT_NONE, ssl_version=PROTOCOL_TLS, ca_certs=None,
do_handshake_on_connect=True, suppress_ragged_eofs=True, ciphers=None)`

    
Takes an instance `sock` of `socket.socket`, and returns an instance of
`ssl.SSLSocket`, a subtype of `socket.socket`, which wraps the underlying
socket in an SSL context. `sock` must be a `SOCK_STREAM` socket; other socket
types are unsupported.

Internally, function creates a `SSLContext` with protocol ssl_version and
`SSLContext.options` set to cert_reqs. If parameters keyfile, certfile,
ca_certs or ciphers are set, then the values are passed to
`SSLContext.load_cert_chain()`, `SSLContext.load_verify_locations()`, and
`SSLContext.set_ciphers()`.

The arguments server_side, do_handshake_on_connect, and suppress_ragged_eofs
have the same meaning as `SSLContext.wrap_socket()`.

Deprecated since version 3.7: Since Python 3.2 and 2.7.9, it is recommended to
use the `SSLContext.wrap_socket()` instead of `wrap_socket()`. The top-level
function is limited and creates an insecure client socket without server name
indication or hostname matching.

### Constants

All constants are now `enum.IntEnum` or `enum.IntFlag` collections.

New in version 3.6.

`ssl.CERT_NONE`

    
Possible value for `SSLContext.verify_mode`, or the `cert_reqs` parameter to
`wrap_socket()`. Except for `PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT`, it is the default mode.
With client-side sockets, just about any cert is accepted. Validation errors,
such as untrusted or expired cert, are ignored and do not abort the TLS/SSL
handshake.

In server mode, no certificate is requested from the client, so the client
does not send any for client cert authentication.

See the discussion of Security considerations below.

`ssl.CERT_OPTIONAL`

    
Possible value for `SSLContext.verify_mode`, or the `cert_reqs` parameter to
`wrap_socket()`. In client mode, `CERT_OPTIONAL` has the same meaning as
`CERT_REQUIRED`. It is recommended to use `CERT_REQUIRED` for client-side
sockets instead.

In server mode, a client certificate request is sent to the client. The client
may either ignore the request or send a certificate in order perform TLS
client cert authentication. If the client chooses to send a certificate, it is
verified. Any verification error immediately aborts the TLS handshake.

Use of this setting requires a valid set of CA certificates to be passed,
either to `SSLContext.load_verify_locations()` or as a value of the `ca_certs`
parameter to `wrap_socket()`.

`ssl.CERT_REQUIRED`

    
Possible value for `SSLContext.verify_mode`, or the `cert_reqs` parameter to
`wrap_socket()`. In this mode, certificates are required from the other side
of the socket connection; an `SSLError` will be raised if no certificate is
provided, or if its validation fails. This mode is not sufficient to verify a
certificate in client mode as it does not match hostnames. `check_hostname`
must be enabled as well to verify the authenticity of a cert.
`PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT` uses `CERT_REQUIRED` and enables `check_hostname` by
default.

With server socket, this mode provides mandatory TLS client cert
authentication. A client certificate request is sent to the client and the
client must provide a valid and trusted certificate.

Use of this setting requires a valid set of CA certificates to be passed,
either to `SSLContext.load_verify_locations()` or as a value of the `ca_certs`
parameter to `wrap_socket()`.

`class ssl.VerifyMode`

    
`enum.IntEnum` collection of CERT_* constants.

New in version 3.6.

`ssl.VERIFY_DEFAULT`

    
Possible value for `SSLContext.verify_flags`. In this mode, certificate
revocation lists (CRLs) are not checked. By default OpenSSL does neither
require nor verify CRLs.

New in version 3.4.

`ssl.VERIFY_CRL_CHECK_LEAF`

    
Possible value for `SSLContext.verify_flags`. In this mode, only the peer cert
is checked but none of the intermediate CA certificates. The mode requires a
valid CRL that is signed by the peer cert’s issuer (its direct ancestor CA).
If no proper CRL has been loaded with `SSLContext.load_verify_locations`,
validation will fail.

New in version 3.4.

`ssl.VERIFY_CRL_CHECK_CHAIN`

    
Possible value for `SSLContext.verify_flags`. In this mode, CRLs of all
certificates in the peer cert chain are checked.

New in version 3.4.

`ssl.VERIFY_X509_STRICT`

    
Possible value for `SSLContext.verify_flags` to disable workarounds for broken
X.509 certificates.

New in version 3.4.

`ssl.VERIFY_X509_TRUSTED_FIRST`

    
Possible value for `SSLContext.verify_flags`. It instructs OpenSSL to prefer
trusted certificates when building the trust chain to validate a certificate.
This flag is enabled by default.

New in version 3.4.4.

`class ssl.VerifyFlags`

    
`enum.IntFlag` collection of VERIFY_* constants.

New in version 3.6.

`ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS`

    
Selects the highest protocol version that both the client and server support.
Despite the name, this option can select both “SSL” and “TLS” protocols.

New in version 3.6.

`ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT`

    
Auto-negotiate the highest protocol version like `PROTOCOL_TLS`, but only
support client-side `SSLSocket` connections. The protocol enables
`CERT_REQUIRED` and `check_hostname` by default.

New in version 3.6.

`ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER`

    
Auto-negotiate the highest protocol version like `PROTOCOL_TLS`, but only
support server-side `SSLSocket` connections.

New in version 3.6.

`ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23`

    
Alias for `PROTOCOL_TLS`.

Deprecated since version 3.6: Use `PROTOCOL_TLS` instead.

`ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv2`

    
Selects SSL version 2 as the channel encryption protocol.

This protocol is not available if OpenSSL is compiled with the
`OPENSSL_NO_SSL2` flag.

Warning

SSL version 2 is insecure. Its use is highly discouraged.

Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has removed support for SSLv2.

`ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3`

    
Selects SSL version 3 as the channel encryption protocol.

This protocol is not be available if OpenSSL is compiled with the
`OPENSSL_NO_SSLv3` flag.

Warning

SSL version 3 is insecure. Its use is highly discouraged.

Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated all version specific
protocols. Use the default protocol `PROTOCOL_TLS` with flags like
`OP_NO_SSLv3` instead.

`ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1`

    
Selects TLS version 1.0 as the channel encryption protocol.

Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated all version specific
protocols. Use the default protocol `PROTOCOL_TLS` with flags like
`OP_NO_SSLv3` instead.

`ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_1`

    
Selects TLS version 1.1 as the channel encryption protocol. Available only
with openssl version 1.0.1+.

New in version 3.4.

Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated all version specific
protocols. Use the default protocol `PROTOCOL_TLS` with flags like
`OP_NO_SSLv3` instead.

`ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2`

    
Selects TLS version 1.2 as the channel encryption protocol. This is the most
modern version, and probably the best choice for maximum protection, if both
sides can speak it. Available only with openssl version 1.0.1+.

New in version 3.4.

Deprecated since version 3.6: OpenSSL has deprecated all version specific
protocols. Use the default protocol `PROTOCOL_TLS` with flags like
`OP_NO_SSLv3` instead.

`ssl.OP_ALL`

    
Enables workarounds for various bugs present in other SSL implementations.
This option is set by default. It does not necessarily set the same flags as
OpenSSL’s `SSL_OP_ALL` constant.

New in version 3.2.

`ssl.OP_NO_SSLv2`

    
Prevents an SSLv2 connection. This option is only applicable in conjunction
with `PROTOCOL_TLS`. It prevents the peers from choosing SSLv2 as the protocol
version.

New in version 3.2.

Deprecated since version 3.6: SSLv2 is deprecated

`ssl.OP_NO_SSLv3`

    
Prevents an SSLv3 connection. This option is only applicable in conjunction
with `PROTOCOL_TLS`. It prevents the peers from choosing SSLv3 as the protocol
version.

New in version 3.2.

Deprecated since version 3.6: SSLv3 is deprecated

`ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1`

    
Prevents a TLSv1 connection. This option is only applicable in conjunction
with `PROTOCOL_TLS`. It prevents the peers from choosing TLSv1 as the protocol
version.

New in version 3.2.

Deprecated since version 3.7: The option is deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0,
use the new `SSLContext.minimum_version` and `SSLContext.maximum_version`
instead.

`ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_1`

    
Prevents a TLSv1.1 connection. This option is only applicable in conjunction
with `PROTOCOL_TLS`. It prevents the peers from choosing TLSv1.1 as the
protocol version. Available only with openssl version 1.0.1+.

New in version 3.4.

Deprecated since version 3.7: The option is deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0.

`ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_2`

    
Prevents a TLSv1.2 connection. This option is only applicable in conjunction
with `PROTOCOL_TLS`. It prevents the peers from choosing TLSv1.2 as the
protocol version. Available only with openssl version 1.0.1+.

New in version 3.4.

Deprecated since version 3.7: The option is deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0.

`ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_3`

    
Prevents a TLSv1.3 connection. This option is only applicable in conjunction
with `PROTOCOL_TLS`. It prevents the peers from choosing TLSv1.3 as the
protocol version. TLS 1.3 is available with OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later. When
Python has been compiled against an older version of OpenSSL, the flag
defaults to 0.

New in version 3.7.

Deprecated since version 3.7: The option is deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0. It
was added to 2.7.15, 3.6.3 and 3.7.0 for backwards compatibility with OpenSSL
1.0.2.

`ssl.OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION`

    
Disable all renegotiation in TLSv1.2 and earlier. Do not send HelloRequest
messages, and ignore renegotiation requests via ClientHello.

## SSL Sockets

`class ssl.SSLSocket(socket.socket)`

    
SSL sockets provide the following methods of Socket Objects:

  * `accept()`
  * `bind()`
  * `close()`
  * `connect()`
  * `detach()`
  * `fileno()`
  * `getpeername()`, `getsockname()`
  * `getsockopt()`, `setsockopt()`
  * `gettimeout()`, `settimeout()`, `setblocking()`
  * `listen()`
  * `makefile()`
  * `recv()`, `recv_into()` (but passing a non-zero `flags` argument is not allowed)
  * `send()`, `sendall()` (with the same limitation)
  * `sendfile()` (but `os.sendfile` will be used for plain-text sockets only, else `send()` will be used)
  * `shutdown()`

However, since the SSL (and TLS) protocol has its own framing atop of TCP, the
SSL sockets abstraction can, in certain respects, diverge from the
specification of normal, OS-level sockets. See especially the notes on non-
blocking sockets.

Instances of `SSLSocket` must be created using the `SSLContext.wrap_socket()`
method.

Changed in version 3.5: The `sendfile()` method was added.

Changed in version 3.5: The `shutdown()` does not reset the socket timeout
each time bytes are received or sent. The socket timeout is now to maximum
total duration of the shutdown.

Deprecated since version 3.6: It is deprecated to create a `SSLSocket`
instance directly, use `SSLContext.wrap_socket()` to wrap a socket.

Changed in version 3.7: `SSLSocket` instances must to created with
`wrap_socket()`. In earlier versions, it was possible to create instances
directly. This was never documented or officially supported.

SSL sockets also have the following additional methods and attributes:

`SSLSocket.read(len=1024, buffer=None)`

    
Read up to len bytes of data from the SSL socket and return the result as a
`bytes` instance. If buffer is specified, then read into the buffer instead,
and return the number of bytes read.

Raise `SSLWantReadError` or `SSLWantWriteError` if the socket is non-blocking
and the read would block.

As at any time a re-negotiation is possible, a call to `read()` can also cause
write operations.

Changed in version 3.5: The socket timeout is no more reset each time bytes
are received or sent. The socket timeout is now to maximum total duration to
read up to len bytes.

Deprecated since version 3.6: Use `recv()` instead of `read()`.

`SSLSocket.write(buf)`

    
Write buf to the SSL socket and return the number of bytes written. The buf
argument must be an object supporting the buffer interface.

Raise `SSLWantReadError` or `SSLWantWriteError` if the socket is non-blocking
and the write would block.

As at any time a re-negotiation is possible, a call to `write()` can also
cause read operations.

Changed in version 3.5: The socket timeout is no more reset each time bytes
are received or sent. The socket timeout is now to maximum total duration to
write buf.

Deprecated since version 3.6: Use `send()` instead of `write()`.

Note

The `read()` and `write()` methods are the low-level methods that read and
write unencrypted, application-level data and decrypt/encrypt it to encrypted,
wire-level data. These methods require an active SSL connection, i.e. the
handshake was completed and `SSLSocket.unwrap()` was not called.

Normally you should use the socket API methods like `recv()` and `send()`
instead of these methods.

`SSLSocket.do_handshake()`

    
Perform the SSL setup handshake.

Changed in version 3.4: The handshake method also performs `match_hostname()`
when the `check_hostname` attribute of the socket’s `context` is true.

Changed in version 3.5: The socket timeout is no more reset each time bytes
are received or sent. The socket timeout is now to maximum total duration of
the handshake.

Changed in version 3.7: Hostname or IP address is matched by OpenSSL during
handshake. The function `match_hostname()` is no longer used. In case OpenSSL
refuses a hostname or IP address, the handshake is aborted early and a TLS
alert message is send to the peer.

`SSLSocket.getpeercert(binary_form=False)`

    
If there is no certificate for the peer on the other end of the connection,
return `None`. If the SSL handshake hasn’t been done yet, raise `ValueError`.

If the `binary_form` parameter is `False`, and a certificate was received from
the peer, this method returns a `dict` instance. If the certificate was not
validated, the dict is empty. If the certificate was validated, it returns a
dict with several keys, amongst them `subject` (the principal for which the
certificate was issued) and `issuer` (the principal issuing the certificate).
If a certificate contains an instance of the Subject Alternative Name
extension (see RFC 3280), there will also be a `subjectAltName` key in the
dictionary.

The `subject` and `issuer` fields are tuples containing the sequence of
relative distinguished names (RDNs) given in the certificate’s data structure
for the respective fields, and each RDN is a sequence of name-value pairs.
Here is a real-world example:

    
    {'issuer': ((('countryName', 'IL'),),
                (('organizationName', 'StartCom Ltd.'),),
                (('organizationalUnitName',
                  'Secure Digital Certificate Signing'),),
                (('commonName',
                  'StartCom Class 2 Primary Intermediate Server CA'),)),
     'notAfter': 'Nov 22 08:15:19 2013 GMT',
     'notBefore': 'Nov 21 03:09:52 2011 GMT',
     'serialNumber': '95F0',
     'subject': ((('description', '571208-SLe257oHY9fVQ07Z'),),
                 (('countryName', 'US'),),
                 (('stateOrProvinceName', 'California'),),
                 (('localityName', 'San Francisco'),),
                 (('organizationName', 'Electronic Frontier Foundation, Inc.'),),
                 (('commonName', '*.eff.org'),),
                 (('emailAddress', 'hostmaster@eff.org'),)),
     'subjectAltName': (('DNS', '*.eff.org'), ('DNS', 'eff.org')),
     'version': 3}
    
Note

To validate a certificate for a particular service, you can use the
`match_hostname()` function.

If the `binary_form` parameter is `True`, and a certificate was provided, this
method returns the DER-encoded form of the entire certificate as a sequence of
bytes, or `None` if the peer did not provide a certificate. Whether the peer
provides a certificate depends on the SSL socket’s role:

  * for a client SSL socket, the server will always provide a certificate, regardless of whether validation was required;
  * for a server SSL socket, the client will only provide a certificate when requested by the server; therefore `getpeercert()` will return `None` if you used `CERT_NONE` (rather than `CERT_OPTIONAL` or `CERT_REQUIRED`).

Changed in version 3.2: The returned dictionary includes additional items such
as `issuer` and `notBefore`.

Changed in version 3.4: `ValueError` is raised when the handshake isn’t done.
The returned dictionary includes additional X509v3 extension items such as
`crlDistributionPoints`, `caIssuers` and `OCSP` URIs.

Changed in version 3.9: IPv6 address strings no longer have a trailing new
line.

`SSLSocket.cipher()`

    
Returns a three-value tuple containing the name of the cipher being used, the
version of the SSL protocol that defines its use, and the number of secret
bits being used. If no connection has been established, returns `None`.

`SSLSocket.shared_ciphers()`

    
Return the list of ciphers shared by the client during the handshake. Each
entry of the returned list is a three-value tuple containing the name of the
cipher, the version of the SSL protocol that defines its use, and the number
of secret bits the cipher uses. `shared_ciphers()` returns `None` if no
connection has been established or the socket is a client socket.

New in version 3.5.

`SSLSocket.compression()`

    
Return the compression algorithm being used as a string, or `None` if the
connection isn’t compressed.

If the higher-level protocol supports its own compression mechanism, you can
use `OP_NO_COMPRESSION` to disable SSL-level compression.

New in version 3.3.

`SSLSocket.get_channel_binding(cb_type="tls-unique")`

    
Get channel binding data for current connection, as a bytes object. Returns
`None` if not connected or the handshake has not been completed.

The cb_type parameter allow selection of the desired channel binding type.
Valid channel binding types are listed in the `CHANNEL_BINDING_TYPES` list.
Currently only the ‘tls-unique’ channel binding, defined by RFC 5929, is
supported. `ValueError` will be raised if an unsupported channel binding type
is requested.

New in version 3.3.

`SSLSocket.selected_alpn_protocol()`

    
Return the protocol that was selected during the TLS handshake. If
`SSLContext.set_alpn_protocols()` was not called, if the other party does not
support ALPN, if this socket does not support any of the client’s proposed
protocols, or if the handshake has not happened yet, `None` is returned.

New in version 3.5.

`SSLSocket.selected_npn_protocol()`

    
Return the higher-level protocol that was selected during the TLS/SSL
handshake. If `SSLContext.set_npn_protocols()` was not called, or if the other
party does not support NPN, or if the handshake has not yet happened, this
will return `None`.

New in version 3.3.

`SSLSocket.unwrap()`

    
Performs the SSL shutdown handshake, which removes the TLS layer from the
underlying socket, and returns the underlying socket object. This can be used
to go from encrypted operation over a connection to unencrypted. The returned
socket should always be used for further communication with the other side of
the connection, rather than the original socket.

`SSLSocket.verify_client_post_handshake()`

    
Requests post-handshake authentication (PHA) from a TLS 1.3 client. PHA can
only be initiated for a TLS 1.3 connection from a server-side socket, after
the initial TLS handshake and with PHA enabled on both sides, see
`SSLContext.post_handshake_auth`.

The method does not perform a cert exchange immediately. The server-side sends
a CertificateRequest during the next write event and expects the client to
respond with a certificate on the next read event.

If any precondition isn’t met (e.g. not TLS 1.3, PHA not enabled), an
`SSLError` is raised.

Note

Only available with OpenSSL 1.1.1 and TLS 1.3 enabled. Without TLS 1.3
support, the method raises `NotImplementedError`.

New in version 3.8.

`SSLSocket.version()`

    
Return the actual SSL protocol version negotiated by the connection as a
string, or `None` is no secure connection is established. As of this writing,
possible return values include `"SSLv2"`, `"SSLv3"`, `"TLSv1"`, `"TLSv1.1"`
and `"TLSv1.2"`. Recent OpenSSL versions may define more return values.

New in version 3.5.

`SSLSocket.pending()`

    
Returns the number of already decrypted bytes available for read, pending on
the connection.

`SSLSocket.context`

    
The `SSLContext` object this SSL socket is tied to. If the SSL socket was
created using the deprecated `wrap_socket()` function (rather than
`SSLContext.wrap_socket()`), this is a custom context object created for this
SSL socket.

New in version 3.2.

`SSLSocket.server_side`

    
A boolean which is `True` for server-side sockets and `False` for client-side
sockets.

New in version 3.2.

`SSLSocket.server_hostname`

    
Hostname of the server: `str` type, or `None` for server-side socket or if the
hostname was not specified in the constructor.

New in version 3.2.

Changed in version 3.7: The attribute is now always ASCII text. When
`server_hostname` is an internationalized domain name (IDN), this attribute
now stores the A-label form (`"xn--pythn-mua.org"`), rather than the U-label
form (`"pythön.org"`).

`SSLSocket.session`

    
The `SSLSession` for this SSL connection. The session is available for client
and server side sockets after the TLS handshake has been performed. For client
sockets the session can be set before `do_handshake()` has been called to
reuse a session.

New in version 3.6.

`SSLSocket.session_reused`

    
New in version 3.6.

## SSL Contexts

New in version 3.2.

An SSL context holds various data longer-lived than single SSL connections,
such as SSL configuration options, certificate(s) and private key(s). It also
manages a cache of SSL sessions for server-side sockets, in order to speed up
repeated connections from the same clients.

`class ssl.SSLContext(protocol=PROTOCOL_TLS)`

    
Create a new SSL context. You may pass protocol which must be one of the
`PROTOCOL_*` constants defined in this module. The parameter specifies which
version of the SSL protocol to use. Typically, the server chooses a particular
protocol version, and the client must adapt to the server’s choice. Most of
the versions are not interoperable with the other versions. If not specified,
the default is `PROTOCOL_TLS`; it provides the most compatibility with other
versions.

Here’s a table showing which versions in a client (down the side) can connect
to which versions in a server (along the top):

client / server | SSLv2 | SSLv3 | TLS 3 | TLSv1 | TLSv1.1 | TLSv1.2  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
SSLv2 | yes | no | no 1 | no | no | no  
SSLv3 | no | yes | no 2 | no | no | no  
TLS (SSLv23) 3 | no 1 | no 2 | yes | yes | yes | yes  
TLSv1 | no | no | yes | yes | no | no  
TLSv1.1 | no | no | yes | no | yes | no  
TLSv1.2 | no | no | yes | no | no | yes  
#### Footnotes

`1(1,2)`

    
`SSLContext` disables SSLv2 with `OP_NO_SSLv2` by default.

`2(1,2)`

    
`SSLContext` disables SSLv3 with `OP_NO_SSLv3` by default.

`3(1,2)`

    
TLS 1.3 protocol will be available with `PROTOCOL_TLS` in OpenSSL >= 1.1.1.
There is no dedicated PROTOCOL constant for just TLS 1.3.

See also

`create_default_context()` lets the `ssl` module choose security settings for
a given purpose.

Changed in version 3.6: The context is created with secure default values. The
options `OP_NO_COMPRESSION`, `OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE`,
`OP_SINGLE_DH_USE`, `OP_SINGLE_ECDH_USE`, `OP_NO_SSLv2` (except for
`PROTOCOL_SSLv2`), and `OP_NO_SSLv3` (except for `PROTOCOL_SSLv3`) are set by
default. The initial cipher suite list contains only `HIGH` ciphers, no `NULL`
ciphers and no `MD5` ciphers (except for `PROTOCOL_SSLv2`).

`SSLContext` objects have the following methods and attributes:

`SSLContext.cert_store_stats()`

    
Get statistics about quantities of loaded X.509 certificates, count of X.509
certificates flagged as CA certificates and certificate revocation lists as
dictionary.

Example for a context with one CA cert and one other cert:

    
    >>> context.cert_store_stats()
    {'crl': 0, 'x509_ca': 1, 'x509': 2}
    
New in version 3.4.

`SSLContext.load_cert_chain(certfile, keyfile=None, password=None)`

    
Load a private key and the corresponding certificate. The certfile string must
be the path to a single file in PEM format containing the certificate as well
as any number of CA certificates needed to establish the certificate’s
authenticity. The keyfile string, if present, must point to a file containing
the private key in. Otherwise the private key will be taken from certfile as
well. See the discussion of Certificates for more information on how the
certificate is stored in the certfile.

The password argument may be a function to call to get the password for
decrypting the private key. It will only be called if the private key is
encrypted and a password is necessary. It will be called with no arguments,
and it should return a string, bytes, or bytearray. If the return value is a
string it will be encoded as UTF-8 before using it to decrypt the key.
Alternatively a string, bytes, or bytearray value may be supplied directly as
the password argument. It will be ignored if the private key is not encrypted
and no password is needed.

If the password argument is not specified and a password is required,
OpenSSL’s built-in password prompting mechanism will be used to interactively
prompt the user for a password.

An `SSLError` is raised if the private key doesn’t match with the certificate.

Changed in version 3.3: New optional argument password.

`SSLContext.load_default_certs(purpose=Purpose.SERVER_AUTH)`

    
Load a set of default “certification authority” (CA) certificates from default
locations. On Windows it loads CA certs from the `CA` and `ROOT` system
stores. On other systems it calls `SSLContext.set_default_verify_paths()`. In
the future the method may load CA certificates from other locations, too.

The purpose flag specifies what kind of CA certificates are loaded. The
default settings `Purpose.SERVER_AUTH` loads certificates, that are flagged
and trusted for TLS web server authentication (client side sockets).
`Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH` loads CA certificates for client certificate
verification on the server side.

New in version 3.4.

`SSLContext.load_verify_locations(cafile=None, capath=None, cadata=None)`

    
Load a set of “certification authority” (CA) certificates used to validate
other peers’ certificates when `verify_mode` is other than `CERT_NONE`. At
least one of cafile or capath must be specified.

This method can also load certification revocation lists (CRLs) in PEM or DER
format. In order to make use of CRLs, `SSLContext.verify_flags` must be
configured properly.

The cafile string, if present, is the path to a file of concatenated CA
certificates in PEM format. See the discussion of Certificates for more
information about how to arrange the certificates in this file.

The capath string, if present, is the path to a directory containing several
CA certificates in PEM format, following an OpenSSL specific layout.

The cadata object, if present, is either an ASCII string of one or more PEM-
encoded certificates or a bytes-like object of DER-encoded certificates. Like
with capath extra lines around PEM-encoded certificates are ignored but at
least one certificate must be present.

Changed in version 3.4: New optional argument cadata

`SSLContext.get_ca_certs(binary_form=False)`

    
Get a list of loaded “certification authority” (CA) certificates. If the
`binary_form` parameter is `False` each list entry is a dict like the output
of `SSLSocket.getpeercert()`. Otherwise the method returns a list of DER-
encoded certificates. The returned list does not contain certificates from
capath unless a certificate was requested and loaded by a SSL connection.

Note

Certificates in a capath directory aren’t loaded unless they have been used at
least once.

New in version 3.4.

`SSLContext.get_ciphers()`

    
Get a list of enabled ciphers. The list is in order of cipher priority. See
`SSLContext.set_ciphers()`.

Example:

    
    >>> ctx = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23)
    >>> ctx.set_ciphers('ECDHE+AESGCM:!ECDSA')
    >>> ctx.get_ciphers()  # OpenSSL 1.0.x
    [{'alg_bits': 256,
      'description': 'ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 TLSv1.2 Kx=ECDH     Au=RSA  '
                     'Enc=AESGCM(256) Mac=AEAD',
      'id': 50380848,
      'name': 'ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384',
      'protocol': 'TLSv1/SSLv3',
      'strength_bits': 256},
     {'alg_bits': 128,
      'description': 'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 TLSv1.2 Kx=ECDH     Au=RSA  '
                     'Enc=AESGCM(128) Mac=AEAD',

      'name': 'ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256',
      'protocol': 'TLSv1/SSLv3',
      'strength_bits': 128}]
    
On OpenSSL 1.1 and newer the cipher dict contains additional fields:

    
    >>> ctx.get_ciphers()  # OpenSSL 1.1+
    [{'aead': True,
      'alg_bits': 256,
      'auth': 'auth-rsa',

                     'Enc=AESGCM(256) Mac=AEAD',
      'digest': None,
      'id': 50380848,

`SSLContext.set_default_verify_paths()`

    
Load a set of default “certification authority” (CA) certificates from a
filesystem path defined when building the OpenSSL library. Unfortunately,
there’s no easy way to know whether this method succeeds: no error is returned
if no certificates are to be found. When the OpenSSL library is provided as
part of the operating system, though, it is likely to be configured properly.

`SSLContext.set_ciphers(ciphers)`

    
Set the available ciphers for sockets created with this context. It should be
a string in the OpenSSL cipher list format. If no cipher can be selected
(because compile-time options or other configuration forbids use of all the
specified ciphers), an `SSLError` will be raised.

Note

when connected, the `SSLSocket.cipher()` method of SSL sockets will give the
currently selected cipher.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 has TLS 1.3 cipher suites enabled by default. The suites cannot
be disabled with `set_ciphers()`.

`SSLContext.set_alpn_protocols(protocols)`

    
Specify which protocols the socket should advertise during the SSL/TLS
handshake. It should be a list of ASCII strings, like `['http/1.1',
'spdy/2']`, ordered by preference. The selection of a protocol will happen
during the handshake, and will play out according to RFC 7301. After a
successful handshake, the `SSLSocket.selected_alpn_protocol()` method will
return the agreed-upon protocol.

This method will raise `NotImplementedError` if `HAS_ALPN` is `False`.

OpenSSL 1.1.0 to 1.1.0e will abort the handshake and raise `SSLError` when
both sides support ALPN but cannot agree on a protocol. 1.1.0f+ behaves like
1.0.2, `SSLSocket.selected_alpn_protocol()` returns None.

New in version 3.5.

`SSLContext.set_npn_protocols(protocols)`

    
Specify which protocols the socket should advertise during the SSL/TLS
handshake. It should be a list of strings, like `['http/1.1', 'spdy/2']`,
ordered by preference. The selection of a protocol will happen during the
handshake, and will play out according to the Application Layer Protocol
Negotiation. After a successful handshake, the
`SSLSocket.selected_npn_protocol()` method will return the agreed-upon
protocol.

This method will raise `NotImplementedError` if `HAS_NPN` is `False`.

New in version 3.3.

`SSLContext.sni_callback`

    
Register a callback function that will be called after the TLS Client Hello
handshake message has been received by the SSL/TLS server when the TLS client
specifies a server name indication. The server name indication mechanism is
specified in RFC 6066 section 3 - Server Name Indication.

Only one callback can be set per `SSLContext`. If sni_callback is set to
`None` then the callback is disabled. Calling this function a subsequent time
will disable the previously registered callback.

The callback function will be called with three arguments; the first being the
`ssl.SSLSocket`, the second is a string that represents the server name that
the client is intending to communicate (or `None` if the TLS Client Hello does
not contain a server name) and the third argument is the original
`SSLContext`. The server name argument is text. For internationalized domain
name, the server name is an IDN A-label (`"xn--pythn-mua.org"`).

A typical use of this callback is to change the `ssl.SSLSocket`’s
`SSLSocket.context` attribute to a new object of type `SSLContext`
representing a certificate chain that matches the server name.

Due to the early negotiation phase of the TLS connection, only limited methods
and attributes are usable like `SSLSocket.selected_alpn_protocol()` and
`SSLSocket.context`. `SSLSocket.getpeercert()`, `SSLSocket.getpeercert()`,
`SSLSocket.cipher()` and `SSLSocket.compress()` methods require that the TLS
connection has progressed beyond the TLS Client Hello and therefore will not
contain return meaningful values nor can they be called safely.

The sni_callback function must return `None` to allow the TLS negotiation to
continue. If a TLS failure is required, a constant `ALERT_DESCRIPTION_*` can
be returned. Other return values will result in a TLS fatal error with
`ALERT_DESCRIPTION_INTERNAL_ERROR`.

If an exception is raised from the sni_callback function the TLS connection
will terminate with a fatal TLS alert message
`ALERT_DESCRIPTION_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE`.

This method will raise `NotImplementedError` if the OpenSSL library had
OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT defined when it was built.

New in version 3.7.

`SSLContext.set_servername_callback(server_name_callback)`

    
This is a legacy API retained for backwards compatibility. When possible, you
should use `sni_callback` instead. The given server_name_callback is similar
to sni_callback, except that when the server hostname is an IDN-encoded
internationalized domain name, the server_name_callback receives a decoded
U-label (`"pythön.org"`).

If there is an decoding error on the server name, the TLS connection will
terminate with an `ALERT_DESCRIPTION_INTERNAL_ERROR` fatal TLS alert message
to the client.

New in version 3.4.

`SSLContext.load_dh_params(dhfile)`

    
Load the key generation parameters for Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange. Using
DH key exchange improves forward secrecy at the expense of computational
resources (both on the server and on the client). The dhfile parameter should
be the path to a file containing DH parameters in PEM format.

This setting doesn’t apply to client sockets. You can also use the
`OP_SINGLE_DH_USE` option to further improve security.

New in version 3.3.

`SSLContext.set_ecdh_curve(curve_name)`

    
Set the curve name for Elliptic Curve-based Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key
exchange. ECDH is significantly faster than regular DH while arguably as
secure. The curve_name parameter should be a string describing a well-known
elliptic curve, for example `prime256v1` for a widely supported curve.

This setting doesn’t apply to client sockets. You can also use the
`OP_SINGLE_ECDH_USE` option to further improve security.

This method is not available if `HAS_ECDH` is `False`.

New in version 3.3.

`SSLContext.wrap_socket(sock, server_side=False, do_handshake_on_connect=True,
suppress_ragged_eofs=True, server_hostname=None, session=None)`

    
Wrap an existing Python socket sock and return an instance of
`SSLContext.sslsocket_class` (default `SSLSocket`). The returned SSL socket is
tied to the context, its settings and certificates. sock must be a
`SOCK_STREAM` socket; other socket types are unsupported.

The parameter `server_side` is a boolean which identifies whether server-side
or client-side behavior is desired from this socket.

For client-side sockets, the context construction is lazy; if the underlying
socket isn’t connected yet, the context construction will be performed after
`connect()` is called on the socket. For server-side sockets, if the socket
has no remote peer, it is assumed to be a listening socket, and the server-
side SSL wrapping is automatically performed on client connections accepted
via the `accept()` method. The method may raise `SSLError`.

On client connections, the optional parameter server_hostname specifies the
hostname of the service which we are connecting to. This allows a single
server to host multiple SSL-based services with distinct certificates, quite
similarly to HTTP virtual hosts. Specifying server_hostname will raise a
`ValueError` if server_side is true.

The parameter `do_handshake_on_connect` specifies whether to do the SSL
handshake automatically after doing a `socket.connect()`, or whether the
application program will call it explicitly, by invoking the
`SSLSocket.do_handshake()` method. Calling `SSLSocket.do_handshake()`
explicitly gives the program control over the blocking behavior of the socket
I/O involved in the handshake.

The parameter `suppress_ragged_eofs` specifies how the `SSLSocket.recv()`
method should signal unexpected EOF from the other end of the connection. If
specified as `True` (the default), it returns a normal EOF (an empty bytes
object) in response to unexpected EOF errors raised from the underlying
socket; if `False`, it will raise the exceptions back to the caller.

session, see `session`.

Changed in version 3.5: Always allow a server_hostname to be passed, even if
OpenSSL does not have SNI.

Changed in version 3.6: session argument was added.

Changed in version 3.7: The method returns on instance of
`SSLContext.sslsocket_class` instead of hard-coded `SSLSocket`.

`SSLContext.sslsocket_class`

    
The return type of `SSLContext.wrap_socket()`, defaults to `SSLSocket`. The
attribute can be overridden on instance of class in order to return a custom
subclass of `SSLSocket`.

New in version 3.7.

`SSLContext.wrap_bio(incoming, outgoing, server_side=False,
server_hostname=None, session=None)`

    
Wrap the BIO objects incoming and outgoing and return an instance of
`SSLContext.sslobject_class` (default `SSLObject`). The SSL routines will read
input data from the incoming BIO and write data to the outgoing BIO.

The server_side, server_hostname and session parameters have the same meaning
as in `SSLContext.wrap_socket()`.

Changed in version 3.6: session argument was added.

Changed in version 3.7: The method returns on instance of
`SSLContext.sslobject_class` instead of hard-coded `SSLObject`.

`SSLContext.sslobject_class`

    
The return type of `SSLContext.wrap_bio()`, defaults to `SSLObject`. The
attribute can be overridden on instance of class in order to return a custom
subclass of `SSLObject`.

New in version 3.7.

`SSLContext.session_stats()`

    
Get statistics about the SSL sessions created or managed by this context. A
dictionary is returned which maps the names of each piece of information to
their numeric values. For example, here is the total number of hits and misses
in the session cache since the context was created:

    
    >>> stats = context.session_stats()
    >>> stats['hits'], stats['misses']
    (0, 0)
    
`SSLContext.check_hostname`

    
Whether to match the peer cert’s hostname in `SSLSocket.do_handshake()`. The
context’s `verify_mode` must be set to `CERT_OPTIONAL` or `CERT_REQUIRED`, and
you must pass server_hostname to `wrap_socket()` in order to match the
hostname. Enabling hostname checking automatically sets `verify_mode` from
`CERT_NONE` to `CERT_REQUIRED`. It cannot be set back to `CERT_NONE` as long
as hostname checking is enabled. The `PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT` protocol enables
hostname checking by default. With other protocols, hostname checking must be
enabled explicitly.

Example:

    
    import socket, ssl
    
    context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
    context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_REQUIRED
    context.check_hostname = True
    context.load_default_certs()
    
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    ssl_sock = context.wrap_socket(s, server_hostname='www.verisign.com')
    ssl_sock.connect(('www.verisign.com', 443))
    
New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.7: `verify_mode` is now automatically changed to
`CERT_REQUIRED` when hostname checking is enabled and `verify_mode` is
`CERT_NONE`. Previously the same operation would have failed with a
`ValueError`.

Note

This features requires OpenSSL 0.9.8f or newer.

`SSLContext.keylog_filename`

    
Write TLS keys to a keylog file, whenever key material is generated or
received. The keylog file is designed for debugging purposes only. The file
format is specified by NSS and used by many traffic analyzers such as
Wireshark. The log file is opened in append-only mode. Writes are synchronized
between threads, but not between processes.

New in version 3.8.

Note

This features requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 or newer.

`SSLContext.maximum_version`

    
A `TLSVersion` enum member representing the highest supported TLS version. The
value defaults to `TLSVersion.MAXIMUM_SUPPORTED`. The attribute is read-only
for protocols other than `PROTOCOL_TLS`, `PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT`, and
`PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER`.

The attributes `maximum_version`, `minimum_version` and `SSLContext.options`
all affect the supported SSL and TLS versions of the context. The
implementation does not prevent invalid combination. For example a context
with `OP_NO_TLSv1_2` in `options` and `maximum_version` set to
`TLSVersion.TLSv1_2` will not be able to establish a TLS 1.2 connection.

Note

This attribute is not available unless the ssl module is compiled with OpenSSL
1.1.0g or newer.

New in version 3.7.

`SSLContext.minimum_version`

    
Like `SSLContext.maximum_version` except it is the lowest supported version or
`TLSVersion.MINIMUM_SUPPORTED`.

Note

This attribute is not available unless the ssl module is compiled with OpenSSL
1.1.0g or newer.

New in version 3.7.

`SSLContext.num_tickets`

    
Control the number of TLS 1.3 session tickets of a `TLS_PROTOCOL_SERVER`
context. The setting has no impact on TLS 1.0 to 1.2 connections.

Note

This attribute is not available unless the ssl module is compiled with OpenSSL
1.1.1 or newer.

New in version 3.8.

`SSLContext.options`

    
An integer representing the set of SSL options enabled on this context. The
default value is `OP_ALL`, but you can specify other options such as
`OP_NO_SSLv2` by ORing them together.

Note

With versions of OpenSSL older than 0.9.8m, it is only possible to set
options, not to clear them. Attempting to clear an option (by resetting the
corresponding bits) will raise a `ValueError`.

Changed in version 3.6: `SSLContext.options` returns `Options` flags:

    
    >>> ssl.create_default_context().options  
    <Options.OP_ALL|OP_NO_SSLv3|OP_NO_SSLv2|OP_NO_COMPRESSION: 2197947391>
    
`SSLContext.post_handshake_auth`

    
Enable TLS 1.3 post-handshake client authentication. Post-handshake auth is
disabled by default and a server can only request a TLS client certificate
during the initial handshake. When enabled, a server may request a TLS client
certificate at any time after the handshake.

When enabled on client-side sockets, the client signals the server that it
supports post-handshake authentication.

When enabled on server-side sockets, `SSLContext.verify_mode` must be set to
`CERT_OPTIONAL` or `CERT_REQUIRED`, too. The actual client cert exchange is
delayed until `SSLSocket.verify_client_post_handshake()` is called and some
I/O is performed.

Note

Only available with OpenSSL 1.1.1 and TLS 1.3 enabled. Without TLS 1.3
support, the property value is None and can’t be modified

New in version 3.8.

`SSLContext.protocol`

    
The protocol version chosen when constructing the context. This attribute is
read-only.

`SSLContext.hostname_checks_common_name`

    
Whether `check_hostname` falls back to verify the cert’s subject common name
in the absence of a subject alternative name extension (default: true).

Note

Only writeable with OpenSSL 1.1.0 or higher.

New in version 3.7.

Changed in version 3.9.3: The flag had no effect with OpenSSL before version
1.1.1k. Python 3.8.9, 3.9.3, and 3.10 include workarounds for previous
versions.

`SSLContext.verify_flags`

    
The flags for certificate verification operations. You can set flags like
`VERIFY_CRL_CHECK_LEAF` by ORing them together. By default OpenSSL does
neither require nor verify certificate revocation lists (CRLs). Available only
with openssl version 0.9.8+.

New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.6: `SSLContext.verify_flags` returns `VerifyFlags` flags:

    
    >>> ssl.create_default_context().verify_flags  
    <VerifyFlags.VERIFY_X509_TRUSTED_FIRST: 32768>
    
`SSLContext.verify_mode`

    
Whether to try to verify other peers’ certificates and how to behave if
verification fails. This attribute must be one of `CERT_NONE`, `CERT_OPTIONAL`
or `CERT_REQUIRED`.

Changed in version 3.6: `SSLContext.verify_mode` returns `VerifyMode` enum:

    
    >>> ssl.create_default_context().verify_mode
    <VerifyMode.CERT_REQUIRED: 2>
    
## Certificates

Certificates in general are part of a public-key / private-key system. In this
system, each principal, (which may be a machine, or a person, or an
organization) is assigned a unique two-part encryption key. One part of the
key is public, and is called the public key; the other part is kept secret,
and is called the private key. The two parts are related, in that if you
encrypt a message with one of the parts, you can decrypt it with the other
part, and only with the other part.

A certificate contains information about two principals. It contains the name
of a subject, and the subject’s public key. It also contains a statement by a
second principal, the issuer, that the subject is who they claim to be, and
that this is indeed the subject’s public key. The issuer’s statement is signed
with the issuer’s private key, which only the issuer knows. However, anyone
can verify the issuer’s statement by finding the issuer’s public key,
decrypting the statement with it, and comparing it to the other information in
the certificate. The certificate also contains information about the time
period over which it is valid. This is expressed as two fields, called
“notBefore” and “notAfter”.

In the Python use of certificates, a client or server can use a certificate to
prove who they are. The other side of a network connection can also be
required to produce a certificate, and that certificate can be validated to
the satisfaction of the client or server that requires such validation. The
connection attempt can be set to raise an exception if the validation fails.
Validation is done automatically, by the underlying OpenSSL framework; the
application need not concern itself with its mechanics. But the application
does usually need to provide sets of certificates to allow this process to
take place.

Python uses files to contain certificates. They should be formatted as “PEM”
(see RFC 1422), which is a base-64 encoded form wrapped with a header line and
a footer line:

    
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    
### Certificate chains

The Python files which contain certificates can contain a sequence of
certificates, sometimes called a certificate chain. This chain should start
with the specific certificate for the principal who “is” the client or server,
and then the certificate for the issuer of that certificate, and then the
certificate for the issuer of that certificate, and so on up the chain till
you get to a certificate which is self-signed, that is, a certificate which
has the same subject and issuer, sometimes called a root certificate. The
certificates should just be concatenated together in the certificate file. For
example, suppose we had a three certificate chain, from our server certificate
to the certificate of the certification authority that signed our server
certificate, to the root certificate of the agency which issued the
certification authority’s certificate:

    
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ... (certificate for your server)...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ... (the certificate for the CA)...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ... (the root certificate for the CA's issuer)...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    
### CA certificates

If you are going to require validation of the other side of the connection’s
certificate, you need to provide a “CA certs” file, filled with the
certificate chains for each issuer you are willing to trust. Again, this file
just contains these chains concatenated together. For validation, Python will
use the first chain it finds in the file which matches. The platform’s
certificates file can be used by calling `SSLContext.load_default_certs()`,
this is done automatically with `create_default_context()`.

### Combined key and certificate

Often the private key is stored in the same file as the certificate; in this
case, only the `certfile` parameter to `SSLContext.load_cert_chain()` and
`wrap_socket()` needs to be passed. If the private key is stored with the
certificate, it should come before the first certificate in the certificate
chain:

    
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    ... (private key in base64 encoding) ...
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ... (certificate in base64 PEM encoding) ...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    
### Self-signed certificates

If you are going to create a server that provides SSL-encrypted connection
services, you will need to acquire a certificate for that service. There are
many ways of acquiring appropriate certificates, such as buying one from a
certification authority. Another common practice is to generate a self-signed
certificate. The simplest way to do this is with the OpenSSL package, using
something like the following:

    
    % openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout cert.pem
    Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
    .......++++++
    .............................++++++
    writing new private key to 'cert.pem'
    -----
    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
    -----
    Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
    State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:MyState
    Locality Name (eg, city) []:Some City
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:My Organization, Inc.
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:My Group
    Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:myserver.mygroup.myorganization.com
    Email Address []:ops@myserver.mygroup.myorganization.com
    %
    
The disadvantage of a self-signed certificate is that it is its own root
certificate, and no one else will have it in their cache of known (and
trusted) root certificates.

## Examples

### Testing for SSL support

To test for the presence of SSL support in a Python installation, user code
should use the following idiom:

    
    try:
        import ssl
    except ImportError:
        pass
    else:
        ...  # do something that requires SSL support
    
### Client-side operation

This example creates a SSL context with the recommended security settings for
client sockets, including automatic certificate verification:

    
    >>> context = ssl.create_default_context()
    
If you prefer to tune security settings yourself, you might create a context
from scratch (but beware that you might not get the settings right):

    
    >>> context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
    >>> context.load_verify_locations("/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt")
    
(this snippet assumes your operating system places a bundle of all CA
certificates in `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt`; if not, you’ll get an error
and have to adjust the location)

The `PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT` protocol configures the context for cert validation
and hostname verification. `verify_mode` is set to `CERT_REQUIRED` and
`check_hostname` is set to `True`. All other protocols create SSL contexts
with insecure defaults.

When you use the context to connect to a server, `CERT_REQUIRED` and
`check_hostname` validate the server certificate: it ensures that the server
certificate was signed with one of the CA certificates, checks the signature
for correctness, and verifies other properties like validity and identity of
the hostname:

    
    >>> conn = context.wrap_socket(socket.socket(socket.AF_INET),
    ...                            server_hostname="www.python.org")
    >>> conn.connect(("www.python.org", 443))
    
You may then fetch the certificate:

    
    >>> cert = conn.getpeercert()
    
Visual inspection shows that the certificate does identify the desired service
(that is, the HTTPS host `www.python.org`):

    
    >>> pprint.pprint(cert)

                        ('DNS', 'packaging.python.org'),
                        ('DNS', 'pythonhosted.org'),
                        ('DNS', 'www.pythonhosted.org'),
                        ('DNS', 'test.pythonhosted.org'),
                        ('DNS', 'us.pycon.org'),
                        ('DNS', 'id.python.org')),
     'version': 3}
    
Now the SSL channel is established and the certificate verified, you can
proceed to talk with the server:

    
    >>> conn.sendall(b"HEAD / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: linuxfr.org\r\n\r\n")
    >>> pprint.pprint(conn.recv(1024).split(b"\r\n"))
    [b'HTTP/1.1 200 OK',
     b'Date: Sat, 18 Oct 2014 18:27:20 GMT',
     b'Server: nginx',
     b'Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8',

See the discussion of Security considerations below.

### Server-side operation

For server operation, typically you’ll need to have a server certificate, and
private key, each in a file. You’ll first create a context holding the key and
the certificate, so that clients can check your authenticity. Then you’ll open
a socket, bind it to a port, call `listen()` on it, and start waiting for
clients to connect:

    
    import socket, ssl
    
    context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH)
    context.load_cert_chain(certfile="mycertfile", keyfile="mykeyfile")
    
    bindsocket = socket.socket()
    bindsocket.bind(('myaddr.mydomain.com', 10023))
    bindsocket.listen(5)
    
When a client connects, you’ll call `accept()` on the socket to get the new
socket from the other end, and use the context’s `SSLContext.wrap_socket()`
method to create a server-side SSL socket for the connection:

    
    while True:
        newsocket, fromaddr = bindsocket.accept()
        connstream = context.wrap_socket(newsocket, server_side=True)
        try:
            deal_with_client(connstream)
        finally:
            connstream.shutdown(socket.SHUT_RDWR)
            connstream.close()
    
Then you’ll read data from the `connstream` and do something with it till you
are finished with the client (or the client is finished with you):

    
    def deal_with_client(connstream):
        data = connstream.recv(1024)
        # empty data means the client is finished with us
        while data:
            if not do_something(connstream, data):
                # we'll assume do_something returns False
                # when we're finished with client
                break
            data = connstream.recv(1024)
        # finished with client
    
And go back to listening for new client connections (of course, a real server
would probably handle each client connection in a separate thread, or put the
sockets in non-blocking mode and use an event loop).

## Notes on non-blocking sockets

SSL sockets behave slightly different than regular sockets in non-blocking
mode. When working with non-blocking sockets, there are thus several things
you need to be aware of:

  * Most `SSLSocket` methods will raise either `SSLWantWriteError` or `SSLWantReadError` instead of `BlockingIOError` if an I/O operation would block. `SSLWantReadError` will be raised if a read operation on the underlying socket is necessary, and `SSLWantWriteError` for a write operation on the underlying socket. Note that attempts to write to an SSL socket may require reading from the underlying socket first, and attempts to read from the SSL socket may require a prior write to the underlying socket.
Changed in version 3.5: In earlier Python versions, the `SSLSocket.send()`
method returned zero instead of raising `SSLWantWriteError` or
`SSLWantReadError`.

  * Calling `select()` tells you that the OS-level socket can be read from (or written to), but it does not imply that there is sufficient data at the upper SSL layer. For example, only part of an SSL frame might have arrived. Therefore, you must be ready to handle `SSLSocket.recv()` and `SSLSocket.send()` failures, and retry after another call to `select()`.
  * Conversely, since the SSL layer has its own framing, a SSL socket may still have data available for reading without `select()` being aware of it. Therefore, you should first call `SSLSocket.recv()` to drain any potentially available data, and then only block on a `select()` call if still necessary.
(of course, similar provisions apply when using other primitives such as
`poll()`, or those in the `selectors` module)

  * The SSL handshake itself will be non-blocking: the `SSLSocket.do_handshake()` method has to be retried until it returns successfully. Here is a synopsis using `select()` to wait for the socket’s readiness:
        while True:
        try:
            sock.do_handshake()
            break
        except ssl.SSLWantReadError:
            select.select([sock], [], [])
        except ssl.SSLWantWriteError:
            select.select([], [sock], [])

The `asyncio` module supports non-blocking SSL sockets and provides a higher
level API. It polls for events using the `selectors` module and handles
`SSLWantWriteError`, `SSLWantReadError` and `BlockingIOError` exceptions. It
runs the SSL handshake asynchronously as well.

## Memory BIO Support

New in version 3.5.

Ever since the SSL module was introduced in Python 2.6, the `SSLSocket` class
has provided two related but distinct areas of functionality:

  * SSL protocol handling
  * Network IO

The network IO API is identical to that provided by `socket.socket`, from
which `SSLSocket` also inherits. This allows an SSL socket to be used as a
drop-in replacement for a regular socket, making it very easy to add SSL
support to an existing application.

Combining SSL protocol handling and network IO usually works well, but there
are some cases where it doesn’t. An example is async IO frameworks that want
to use a different IO multiplexing model than the “select/poll on a file
descriptor” (readiness based) model that is assumed by `socket.socket` and by
the internal OpenSSL socket IO routines. This is mostly relevant for platforms
like Windows where this model is not efficient. For this purpose, a reduced
scope variant of `SSLSocket` called `SSLObject` is provided.

`class ssl.SSLObject`

    
A reduced-scope variant of `SSLSocket` representing an SSL protocol instance
that does not contain any network IO methods. This class is typically used by
framework authors that want to implement asynchronous IO for SSL through
memory buffers.

This class implements an interface on top of a low-level SSL object as
implemented by OpenSSL. This object captures the state of an SSL connection
but does not provide any network IO itself. IO needs to be performed through
separate “BIO” objects which are OpenSSL’s IO abstraction layer.

This class has no public constructor. An `SSLObject` instance must be created
using the `wrap_bio()` method. This method will create the `SSLObject`
instance and bind it to a pair of BIOs. The incoming BIO is used to pass data
from Python to the SSL protocol instance, while the outgoing BIO is used to
pass data the other way around.

The following methods are available:

  * `context`
  * `server_side`
  * `server_hostname`
  * `session`
  * `session_reused`
  * `read()`
  * `write()`
  * `getpeercert()`
  * `selected_alpn_protocol()`
  * `selected_npn_protocol()`
  * `cipher()`
  * `shared_ciphers()`
  * `compression()`
  * `pending()`
  * `do_handshake()`
  * `verify_client_post_handshake()`
  * `unwrap()`
  * `get_channel_binding()`
  * `version()`

When compared to `SSLSocket`, this object lacks the following features:

  * Any form of network IO; `recv()` and `send()` read and write only to the underlying `MemoryBIO` buffers.
  * There is no do_handshake_on_connect machinery. You must always manually call `do_handshake()` to start the handshake.
  * There is no handling of suppress_ragged_eofs. All end-of-file conditions that are in violation of the protocol are reported via the `SSLEOFError` exception.
  * The method `unwrap()` call does not return anything, unlike for an SSL socket where it returns the underlying socket.
  * The server_name_callback callback passed to `SSLContext.set_servername_callback()` will get an `SSLObject` instance instead of a `SSLSocket` instance as its first parameter.

Some notes related to the use of `SSLObject`:

  * All IO on an `SSLObject` is non-blocking. This means that for example `read()` will raise an `SSLWantReadError` if it needs more data than the incoming BIO has available.
  * There is no module-level `wrap_bio()` call like there is for `wrap_socket()`. An `SSLObject` is always created via an `SSLContext`.

Changed in version 3.7: `SSLObject` instances must to created with
`wrap_bio()`. In earlier versions, it was possible to create instances
directly. This was never documented or officially supported.

An SSLObject communicates with the outside world using memory buffers. The
class `MemoryBIO` provides a memory buffer that can be used for this purpose.
It wraps an OpenSSL memory BIO (Basic IO) object:

`class ssl.MemoryBIO`

    
A memory buffer that can be used to pass data between Python and an SSL
protocol instance.

`pending`

    
Return the number of bytes currently in the memory buffer.

`eof`

    
A boolean indicating whether the memory BIO is current at the end-of-file
position.

`read(n=-1)`

    
Read up to n bytes from the memory buffer. If n is not specified or negative,
all bytes are returned.

`write(buf)`

    
Write the bytes from buf to the memory BIO. The buf argument must be an object
supporting the buffer protocol.

The return value is the number of bytes written, which is always equal to the
length of buf.

`write_eof()`

    
Write an EOF marker to the memory BIO. After this method has been called, it
is illegal to call `write()`. The attribute `eof` will become true after all
data currently in the buffer has been read.

## SSL session

New in version 3.6.

`class ssl.SSLSession`

    
Session object used by `session`.

`id`

`time`

`timeout`

`ticket_lifetime_hint`

`has_ticket`

## Security considerations

### Best defaults

For client use, if you don’t have any special requirements for your security
policy, it is highly recommended that you use the `create_default_context()`
function to create your SSL context. It will load the system’s trusted CA
certificates, enable certificate validation and hostname checking, and try to
choose reasonably secure protocol and cipher settings.

For example, here is how you would use the `smtplib.SMTP` class to create a
trusted, secure connection to a SMTP server:

    
    >>> import ssl, smtplib
    >>> smtp = smtplib.SMTP("mail.python.org", port=587)
    >>> context = ssl.create_default_context()
    >>> smtp.starttls(context=context)
    (220, b'2.0.0 Ready to start TLS')
    
If a client certificate is needed for the connection, it can be added with
`SSLContext.load_cert_chain()`.

By contrast, if you create the SSL context by calling the `SSLContext`
constructor yourself, it will not have certificate validation nor hostname
checking enabled by default. If you do so, please read the paragraphs below to
achieve a good security level.

### Manual settings

#### Verifying certificates

When calling the `SSLContext` constructor directly, `CERT_NONE` is the
default. Since it does not authenticate the other peer, it can be insecure,
especially in client mode where most of time you would like to ensure the
authenticity of the server you’re talking to. Therefore, when in client mode,
it is highly recommended to use `CERT_REQUIRED`. However, it is in itself not
sufficient; you also have to check that the server certificate, which can be
obtained by calling `SSLSocket.getpeercert()`, matches the desired service.
For many protocols and applications, the service can be identified by the
hostname; in this case, the `match_hostname()` function can be used. This
common check is automatically performed when `SSLContext.check_hostname` is
enabled.

Changed in version 3.7: Hostname matchings is now performed by OpenSSL. Python
no longer uses `match_hostname()`.

In server mode, if you want to authenticate your clients using the SSL layer
(rather than using a higher-level authentication mechanism), you’ll also have
to specify `CERT_REQUIRED` and similarly check the client certificate.

#### Protocol versions

SSL versions 2 and 3 are considered insecure and are therefore dangerous to
use. If you want maximum compatibility between clients and servers, it is
recommended to use `PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT` or `PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER` as the
protocol version. SSLv2 and SSLv3 are disabled by default.

    
    >>> client_context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
    >>> client_context.options |= ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1
    >>> client_context.options |= ssl.OP_NO_TLSv1_1
    
The SSL context created above will only allow TLSv1.2 and later (if supported
by your system) connections to a server. `PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT` implies
certificate validation and hostname checks by default. You have to load
certificates into the context.

#### Cipher selection

If you have advanced security requirements, fine-tuning of the ciphers enabled
when negotiating a SSL session is possible through the
`SSLContext.set_ciphers()` method. Starting from Python 3.2.3, the ssl module
disables certain weak ciphers by default, but you may want to further restrict
the cipher choice. Be sure to read OpenSSL’s documentation about the cipher
list format. If you want to check which ciphers are enabled by a given cipher
list, use `SSLContext.get_ciphers()` or the `openssl ciphers` command on your
system.

### Multi-processing

If using this module as part of a multi-processed application (using, for
example the `multiprocessing` or `concurrent.futures` modules), be aware that
OpenSSL’s internal random number generator does not properly handle forked
processes. Applications must change the PRNG state of the parent process if
they use any SSL feature with `os.fork()`. Any successful call of
`RAND_add()`, `RAND_bytes()` or `RAND_pseudo_bytes()` is sufficient.

## TLS 1.3

New in version 3.7.

Python has provisional and experimental support for TLS 1.3 with OpenSSL
1.1.1. The new protocol behaves slightly differently than previous version of
TLS/SSL. Some new TLS 1.3 features are not yet available.

  * TLS 1.3 uses a disjunct set of cipher suites. All AES-GCM and ChaCha20 cipher suites are enabled by default. The method `SSLContext.set_ciphers()` cannot enable or disable any TLS 1.3 ciphers yet, but `SSLContext.get_ciphers()` returns them.
  * Session tickets are no longer sent as part of the initial handshake and are handled differently. `SSLSocket.session` and `SSLSession` are not compatible with TLS 1.3.
  * Client-side certificates are also no longer verified during the initial handshake. A server can request a certificate at any time. Clients process certificate requests while they send or receive application data from the server.
  * TLS 1.3 features like early data, deferred TLS client cert request, signature algorithm configuration, and rekeying are not supported yet.

## LibreSSL support

LibreSSL is a fork of OpenSSL 1.0.1. The ssl module has limited support for
LibreSSL. Some features are not available when the ssl module is compiled with
LibreSSL.

  * LibreSSL >= 2.6.1 no longer supports NPN. The methods `SSLContext.set_npn_protocols()` and `SSLSocket.selected_npn_protocol()` are not available.
  * `SSLContext.set_default_verify_paths()` ignores the env vars `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_PATH` although `get_default_verify_paths()` still reports them.
