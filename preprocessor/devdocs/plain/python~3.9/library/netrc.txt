# netrc — netrc file processing

Source code: Lib/netrc.py

The `netrc` class parses and encapsulates the netrc file format used by the
Unix ftp program and other FTP clients.

`class netrc.netrc([file])`

    
A `netrc` instance or subclass instance encapsulates data from a netrc file.
The initialization argument, if present, specifies the file to parse. If no
argument is given, the file `.netrc` in the user’s home directory – as
determined by `os.path.expanduser()` – will be read. Otherwise, a
`FileNotFoundError` exception will be raised. Parse errors will raise
`NetrcParseError` with diagnostic information including the file name, line
number, and terminating token. If no argument is specified on a POSIX system,
the presence of passwords in the `.netrc` file will raise a `NetrcParseError`
if the file ownership or permissions are insecure (owned by a user other than
the user running the process, or accessible for read or write by any other
user). This implements security behavior equivalent to that of ftp and other
programs that use `.netrc`.

Changed in version 3.4: Added the POSIX permission check.

Changed in version 3.7: `os.path.expanduser()` is used to find the location of
the `.netrc` file when file is not passed as argument.

`exception netrc.NetrcParseError`

    
Exception raised by the `netrc` class when syntactical errors are encountered
in source text. Instances of this exception provide three interesting
attributes: `msg` is a textual explanation of the error, `filename` is the
name of the source file, and `lineno` gives the line number on which the error
was found.

## netrc Objects

A `netrc` instance has the following methods:

`netrc.authenticators(host)`

    
Return a 3-tuple `(login, account, password)` of authenticators for host. If
the netrc file did not contain an entry for the given host, return the tuple
associated with the ‘default’ entry. If neither matching host nor default
entry is available, return `None`.

`netrc.__repr__()`

    
Dump the class data as a string in the format of a netrc file. (This discards
comments and may reorder the entries.)

Instances of `netrc` have public instance variables:

`netrc.hosts`

    
Dictionary mapping host names to `(login, account, password)` tuples. The
‘default’ entry, if any, is represented as a pseudo-host by that name.

`netrc.macros`

    
Dictionary mapping macro names to string lists.

Note

Passwords are limited to a subset of the ASCII character set. All ASCII
punctuation is allowed in passwords, however, note that whitespace and non-
printable characters are not allowed in passwords. This is a limitation of the
way the .netrc file is parsed and may be removed in the future.
