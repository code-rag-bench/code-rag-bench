# timeit — Measure execution time of small code snippets

Source code: Lib/timeit.py

This module provides a simple way to time small bits of Python code. It has
both a Command-Line Interface as well as a callable one. It avoids a number of
common traps for measuring execution times. See also Tim Peters’ introduction
to the “Algorithms” chapter in the Python Cookbook, published by O’Reilly.

## Basic Examples

The following example shows how the Command-Line Interface can be used to
compare three different expressions:

    
    $ python3 -m timeit '"-".join(str(n) for n in range(100))'
    10000 loops, best of 5: 30.2 usec per loop
    $ python3 -m timeit '"-".join([str(n) for n in range(100)])'
    10000 loops, best of 5: 27.5 usec per loop
    $ python3 -m timeit '"-".join(map(str, range(100)))'
    10000 loops, best of 5: 23.2 usec per loop
    
This can be achieved from the Python Interface with:

    
    >>> import timeit
    >>> timeit.timeit('"-".join(str(n) for n in range(100))', number=10000)
    0.3018611848820001
    >>> timeit.timeit('"-".join([str(n) for n in range(100)])', number=10000)
    0.2727368790656328
    >>> timeit.timeit('"-".join(map(str, range(100)))', number=10000)
    0.23702679807320237
    
A callable can also be passed from the Python Interface:

    
    >>> timeit.timeit(lambda: "-".join(map(str, range(100))), number=10000)
    0.19665591977536678
    
Note however that `timeit()` will automatically determine the number of
repetitions only when the command-line interface is used. In the Examples
section you can find more advanced examples.

## Python Interface

The module defines three convenience functions and a public class:

`timeit.timeit(stmt='pass', setup='pass', timer=<default timer>,
number=1000000, globals=None)`

    
Create a `Timer` instance with the given statement, setup code and timer
function and run its `timeit()` method with number executions. The optional
globals argument specifies a namespace in which to execute the code.

Changed in version 3.5: The optional globals parameter was added.

`timeit.repeat(stmt='pass', setup='pass', timer=<default timer>, repeat=5,
number=1000000, globals=None)`

    
Create a `Timer` instance with the given statement, setup code and timer
function and run its `repeat()` method with the given repeat count and number
executions. The optional globals argument specifies a namespace in which to
execute the code.

Changed in version 3.5: The optional globals parameter was added.

Changed in version 3.7: Default value of repeat changed from 3 to 5.

`timeit.default_timer()`

    
The default timer, which is always `time.perf_counter()`.

Changed in version 3.3: `time.perf_counter()` is now the default timer.

`class timeit.Timer(stmt='pass', setup='pass', timer=<timer function>,
globals=None)`

    
Class for timing execution speed of small code snippets.

The constructor takes a statement to be timed, an additional statement used
for setup, and a timer function. Both statements default to `'pass'`; the
timer function is platform-dependent (see the module doc string). stmt and
setup may also contain multiple statements separated by `;` or newlines, as
long as they don’t contain multi-line string literals. The statement will by
default be executed within timeit’s namespace; this behavior can be controlled
by passing a namespace to globals.

To measure the execution time of the first statement, use the `timeit()`
method. The `repeat()` and `autorange()` methods are convenience methods to
call `timeit()` multiple times.

The execution time of setup is excluded from the overall timed execution run.

The stmt and setup parameters can also take objects that are callable without
arguments. This will embed calls to them in a timer function that will then be
executed by `timeit()`. Note that the timing overhead is a little larger in
this case because of the extra function calls.

Changed in version 3.5: The optional globals parameter was added.

`timeit(number=1000000)`

    
Time number executions of the main statement. This executes the setup
statement once, and then returns the time it takes to execute the main
statement a number of times, measured in seconds as a float. The argument is
the number of times through the loop, defaulting to one million. The main
statement, the setup statement and the timer function to be used are passed to
the constructor.

Note

By default, `timeit()` temporarily turns off garbage collection during the
timing. The advantage of this approach is that it makes independent timings
more comparable. The disadvantage is that GC may be an important component of
the performance of the function being measured. If so, GC can be re-enabled as
the first statement in the setup string. For example:

    
    timeit.Timer('for i in range(10): oct(i)', 'gc.enable()').timeit()
    
`autorange(callback=None)`

    
Automatically determine how many times to call `timeit()`.

This is a convenience function that calls `timeit()` repeatedly so that the
total time >= 0.2 second, returning the eventual (number of loops, time taken
for that number of loops). It calls `timeit()` with increasing numbers from
the sequence 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, … until the time taken is at least 0.2
second.

If callback is given and is not `None`, it will be called after each trial
with two arguments: `callback(number, time_taken)`.

New in version 3.6.

`repeat(repeat=5, number=1000000)`

    
Call `timeit()` a few times.

This is a convenience function that calls the `timeit()` repeatedly, returning
a list of results. The first argument specifies how many times to call
`timeit()`. The second argument specifies the number argument for `timeit()`.

Note

It’s tempting to calculate mean and standard deviation from the result vector
and report these. However, this is not very useful. In a typical case, the
lowest value gives a lower bound for how fast your machine can run the given
code snippet; higher values in the result vector are typically not caused by
variability in Python’s speed, but by other processes interfering with your
timing accuracy. So the `min()` of the result is probably the only number you
should be interested in. After that, you should look at the entire vector and
apply common sense rather than statistics.

Changed in version 3.7: Default value of repeat changed from 3 to 5.

`print_exc(file=None)`

    
Helper to print a traceback from the timed code.

Typical use:

    
    t = Timer(...)       # outside the try/except
    try:
        t.timeit(...)    # or t.repeat(...)
    except Exception:
        t.print_exc()
    
The advantage over the standard traceback is that source lines in the compiled
template will be displayed. The optional file argument directs where the
traceback is sent; it defaults to `sys.stderr`.

## Command-Line Interface

When called as a program from the command line, the following form is used:

    
    python -m timeit [-n N] [-r N] [-u U] [-s S] [-h] [statement ...]
    
Where the following options are understood:

`-n N, --number=N`

    
how many times to execute ‘statement’

`-r N, --repeat=N`

    
how many times to repeat the timer (default 5)

`-s S, --setup=S`

    
statement to be executed once initially (default `pass`)

`-p, --process`

    
measure process time, not wallclock time, using `time.process_time()` instead
of `time.perf_counter()`, which is the default

New in version 3.3.

`-u, --unit=U`

    
specify a time unit for timer output; can select nsec, usec, msec, or sec

New in version 3.5.

`-v, --verbose`

    
print raw timing results; repeat for more digits precision

`-h, --help`

    
print a short usage message and exit

A multi-line statement may be given by specifying each line as a separate
statement argument; indented lines are possible by enclosing an argument in
quotes and using leading spaces. Multiple `-s` options are treated similarly.

If `-n` is not given, a suitable number of loops is calculated by trying
increasing numbers from the sequence 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, … until the total
time is at least 0.2 seconds.

`default_timer()` measurements can be affected by other programs running on
the same machine, so the best thing to do when accurate timing is necessary is
to repeat the timing a few times and use the best time. The `-r` option is
good for this; the default of 5 repetitions is probably enough in most cases.
You can use `time.process_time()` to measure CPU time.

Note

There is a certain baseline overhead associated with executing a pass
statement. The code here doesn’t try to hide it, but you should be aware of
it. The baseline overhead can be measured by invoking the program without
arguments, and it might differ between Python versions.

## Examples

It is possible to provide a setup statement that is executed only once at the
beginning:

    
    $ python -m timeit -s 'text = "sample string"; char = "g"'  'char in text'
    5000000 loops, best of 5: 0.0877 usec per loop
    $ python -m timeit -s 'text = "sample string"; char = "g"'  'text.find(char)'
    1000000 loops, best of 5: 0.342 usec per loop
    
    
    >>> import timeit
    >>> timeit.timeit('char in text', setup='text = "sample string"; char = "g"')
    0.41440500499993504
    >>> timeit.timeit('text.find(char)', setup='text = "sample string"; char = "g"')
    1.7246671520006203
    
The same can be done using the `Timer` class and its methods:

    
    >>> import timeit
    >>> t = timeit.Timer('char in text', setup='text = "sample string"; char = "g"')
    >>> t.timeit()
    0.3955516149999312
    >>> t.repeat()
    [0.40183617287970225, 0.37027556854118704, 0.38344867356679524, 0.3712595970846668, 0.37866875250654886]
    
The following examples show how to time expressions that contain multiple
lines. Here we compare the cost of using `hasattr()` vs. `try`/`except` to
test for missing and present object attributes:

    
    $ python -m timeit 'try:' '  str.__bool__' 'except AttributeError:' '  pass'
    20000 loops, best of 5: 15.7 usec per loop
    $ python -m timeit 'if hasattr(str, "__bool__"): pass'
    50000 loops, best of 5: 4.26 usec per loop
    
    $ python -m timeit 'try:' '  int.__bool__' 'except AttributeError:' '  pass'
    200000 loops, best of 5: 1.43 usec per loop
    $ python -m timeit 'if hasattr(int, "__bool__"): pass'
    100000 loops, best of 5: 2.23 usec per loop
    
    
    >>> import timeit
    >>> # attribute is missing
    >>> s = """\
    ... try:
    ...     str.__bool__
    ... except AttributeError:
    ...     pass
    ... """
    >>> timeit.timeit(stmt=s, number=100000)
    0.9138244460009446
    >>> s = "if hasattr(str, '__bool__'): pass"
    >>> timeit.timeit(stmt=s, number=100000)
    0.5829014980008651
    >>>
    >>> # attribute is present
    >>> s = """\
    ... try:
    ...     int.__bool__
    ... except AttributeError:
    ...     pass
    ... """
    >>> timeit.timeit(stmt=s, number=100000)
    0.04215312199994514
    >>> s = "if hasattr(int, '__bool__'): pass"
    >>> timeit.timeit(stmt=s, number=100000)
    0.08588060699912603
    
To give the `timeit` module access to functions you define, you can pass a
setup parameter which contains an import statement:

    
    def test():
        """Stupid test function"""
        L = [i for i in range(100)]
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        import timeit
        print(timeit.timeit("test()", setup="from __main__ import test"))
    
Another option is to pass `globals()` to the globals parameter, which will
cause the code to be executed within your current global namespace. This can
be more convenient than individually specifying imports:

    
    def f(x):
        return x**2
    def g(x):
        return x**4
    def h(x):
        return x**8
    
    import timeit
    print(timeit.timeit('[func(42) for func in (f,g,h)]', globals=globals()))
