# site — Site-specific configuration hook

Source code: Lib/site.py

This module is automatically imported during initialization. The automatic
import can be suppressed using the interpreter’s `-S` option.

Importing this module will append site-specific paths to the module search
path and add a few builtins, unless `-S` was used. In that case, this module
can be safely imported with no automatic modifications to the module search
path or additions to the builtins. To explicitly trigger the usual site-
specific additions, call the `site.main()` function.

Changed in version 3.3: Importing the module used to trigger paths
manipulation even when using `-S`.

It starts by constructing up to four directories from a head and a tail part.
For the head part, it uses `sys.prefix` and `sys.exec_prefix`; empty heads are
skipped. For the tail part, it uses the empty string and then `lib/site-
packages` (on Windows) or `lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` (on Unix and
Macintosh). For each of the distinct head-tail combinations, it sees if it
refers to an existing directory, and if so, adds it to `sys.path` and also
inspects the newly added path for configuration files.

Changed in version 3.5: Support for the “site-python” directory has been
removed.

If a file named “pyvenv.cfg” exists one directory above sys.executable,
sys.prefix and sys.exec_prefix are set to that directory and it is also
checked for site-packages (sys.base_prefix and sys.base_exec_prefix will
always be the “real” prefixes of the Python installation). If “pyvenv.cfg” (a
bootstrap configuration file) contains the key “include-system-site-packages”
set to anything other than “true” (case-insensitive), the system-level
prefixes will not be searched for site-packages; otherwise they will.

A path configuration file is a file whose name has the form `name.pth` and
exists in one of the four directories mentioned above; its contents are
additional items (one per line) to be added to `sys.path`. Non-existing items
are never added to `sys.path`, and no check is made that the item refers to a
directory rather than a file. No item is added to `sys.path` more than once.
Blank lines and lines beginning with `#` are skipped. Lines starting with
`import` (followed by space or tab) are executed.

Note

An executable line in a `.pth` file is run at every Python startup, regardless
of whether a particular module is actually going to be used. Its impact should
thus be kept to a minimum. The primary intended purpose of executable lines is
to make the corresponding module(s) importable (load 3rd-party import hooks,
adjust `PATH` etc). Any other initialization is supposed to be done upon a
module’s actual import, if and when it happens. Limiting a code chunk to a
single line is a deliberate measure to discourage putting anything more
complex here.

For example, suppose `sys.prefix` and `sys.exec_prefix` are set to
`/usr/local`. The Python X.Y library is then installed in
`/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y`. Suppose this has a subdirectory
`/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` with three subsubdirectories, `foo`,
`bar` and `spam`, and two path configuration files, `foo.pth` and `bar.pth`.
Assume `foo.pth` contains the following:

    
    # foo package configuration
    
    foo
    bar
    bletch
    
and `bar.pth` contains:

    
    # bar package configuration
    
    bar
    
Then the following version-specific directories are added to `sys.path`, in
this order:

    
    /usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/bar
    /usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/foo
    
Note that `bletch` is omitted because it doesn’t exist; the `bar` directory
precedes the `foo` directory because `bar.pth` comes alphabetically before
`foo.pth`; and `spam` is omitted because it is not mentioned in either path
configuration file.

After these path manipulations, an attempt is made to import a module named
`sitecustomize`, which can perform arbitrary site-specific customizations. It
is typically created by a system administrator in the site-packages directory.
If this import fails with an `ImportError` or its subclass exception, and the
exception’s `name` attribute equals to `'sitecustomize'`, it is silently
ignored. If Python is started without output streams available, as with
`pythonw.exe` on Windows (which is used by default to start IDLE), attempted
output from `sitecustomize` is ignored. Any other exception causes a silent
and perhaps mysterious failure of the process.

After this, an attempt is made to import a module named `usercustomize`, which
can perform arbitrary user-specific customizations, if `ENABLE_USER_SITE` is
true. This file is intended to be created in the user site-packages directory
(see below), which is part of `sys.path` unless disabled by `-s`. If this
import fails with an `ImportError` or its subclass exception, and the
exception’s `name` attribute equals to `'usercustomize'`, it is silently
ignored.

Note that for some non-Unix systems, `sys.prefix` and `sys.exec_prefix` are
empty, and the path manipulations are skipped; however the import of
`sitecustomize` and `usercustomize` is still attempted.

## Readline configuration

On systems that support `readline`, this module will also import and configure
the `rlcompleter` module, if Python is started in interactive mode and without
the `-S` option. The default behavior is enable tab-completion and to use
`~/.python_history` as the history save file. To disable it, delete (or
override) the `sys.__interactivehook__` attribute in your `sitecustomize` or
`usercustomize` module or your `PYTHONSTARTUP` file.

Changed in version 3.4: Activation of rlcompleter and history was made
automatic.

## Module contents

`site.PREFIXES`

    
A list of prefixes for site-packages directories.

`site.ENABLE_USER_SITE`

    
Flag showing the status of the user site-packages directory. `True` means that
it is enabled and was added to `sys.path`. `False` means that it was disabled
by user request (with `-s` or `PYTHONNOUSERSITE`). `None` means it was
disabled for security reasons (mismatch between user or group id and effective
id) or by an administrator.

`site.USER_SITE`

    
Path to the user site-packages for the running Python. Can be `None` if
`getusersitepackages()` hasn’t been called yet. Default value is
`~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` for UNIX and non-framework Mac OS X
builds, `~/Library/Python/X.Y/lib/python/site-packages` for Mac framework
builds, and `%APPDATA%\Python\PythonXY\site-packages` on Windows. This
directory is a site directory, which means that `.pth` files in it will be
processed.

`site.USER_BASE`

    
Path to the base directory for the user site-packages. Can be `None` if
`getuserbase()` hasn’t been called yet. Default value is `~/.local` for UNIX
and Mac OS X non-framework builds, `~/Library/Python/X.Y` for Mac framework
builds, and `%APPDATA%\Python` for Windows. This value is used by Distutils to
compute the installation directories for scripts, data files, Python modules,
etc. for the user installation scheme. See also `PYTHONUSERBASE`.

`site.main()`

    
Adds all the standard site-specific directories to the module search path.
This function is called automatically when this module is imported, unless the
Python interpreter was started with the `-S` flag.

Changed in version 3.3: This function used to be called unconditionally.

`site.addsitedir(sitedir, known_paths=None)`

    
Add a directory to sys.path and process its `.pth` files. Typically used in
`sitecustomize` or `usercustomize` (see above).

`site.getsitepackages()`

    
Return a list containing all global site-packages directories.

New in version 3.2.

`site.getuserbase()`

    
Return the path of the user base directory, `USER_BASE`. If it is not
initialized yet, this function will also set it, respecting `PYTHONUSERBASE`.

New in version 3.2.

`site.getusersitepackages()`

    
Return the path of the user-specific site-packages directory, `USER_SITE`. If
it is not initialized yet, this function will also set it, respecting
`USER_BASE`. To determine if the user-specific site-packages was added to
`sys.path` `ENABLE_USER_SITE` should be used.

New in version 3.2.

## Command Line Interface

The `site` module also provides a way to get the user directories from the
command line:

    
    $ python3 -m site --user-site
    /home/user/.local/lib/python3.3/site-packages
    
If it is called without arguments, it will print the contents of `sys.path` on
the standard output, followed by the value of `USER_BASE` and whether the
directory exists, then the same thing for `USER_SITE`, and finally the value
of `ENABLE_USER_SITE`.

`--user-base`

    
Print the path to the user base directory.

`--user-site`

    
Print the path to the user site-packages directory.

If both options are given, user base and user site will be printed (always in
this order), separated by `os.pathsep`.

If any option is given, the script will exit with one of these values: `0` if
the user site-packages directory is enabled, `1` if it was disabled by the
user, `2` if it is disabled for security reasons or by an administrator, and a
value greater than 2 if there is an error.
