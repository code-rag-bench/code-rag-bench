# imghdr — Determine the type of an image

Source code: Lib/imghdr.py

The `imghdr` module determines the type of image contained in a file or byte
stream.

The `imghdr` module defines the following function:

`imghdr.what(filename, h=None)`

    
Tests the image data contained in the file named by filename, and returns a
string describing the image type. If optional h is provided, the filename is
ignored and h is assumed to contain the byte stream to test.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

The following image types are recognized, as listed below with the return
value from `what()`:

Value | Image format  
---|---  
`'rgb'` | SGI ImgLib Files  
`'gif'` | GIF 87a and 89a Files  
`'pbm'` | Portable Bitmap Files  
`'pgm'` | Portable Graymap Files  
`'ppm'` | Portable Pixmap Files  
`'tiff'` | TIFF Files  
`'rast'` | Sun Raster Files  
`'xbm'` | X Bitmap Files  
`'jpeg'` | JPEG data in JFIF or Exif formats  
`'bmp'` | BMP files  
`'png'` | Portable Network Graphics  
`'webp'` | WebP files  
`'exr'` | OpenEXR Files  
New in version 3.5: The exr and webp formats were added.

You can extend the list of file types `imghdr` can recognize by appending to
this variable:

`imghdr.tests`

    
A list of functions performing the individual tests. Each function takes two
arguments: the byte-stream and an open file-like object. When `what()` is
called with a byte-stream, the file-like object will be `None`.

The test function should return a string describing the image type if the test
succeeded, or `None` if it failed.

Example:

    
    >>> import imghdr
    >>> imghdr.what('bass.gif')
    'gif'
