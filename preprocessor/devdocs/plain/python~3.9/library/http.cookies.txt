# http.cookies — HTTP state management

Source code: Lib/http/cookies.py

The `http.cookies` module defines classes for abstracting the concept of
cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism. It supports both simple string-
only cookies, and provides an abstraction for having any serializable data-
type as cookie value.

The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the RFC
2109 and RFC 2068 specifications. It has since been discovered that MSIE 3.0x
doesn’t follow the character rules outlined in those specs and also many
current day browsers and servers have relaxed parsing rules when comes to
Cookie handling. As a result, the parsing rules used are a bit less strict.

The character set, `string.ascii_letters`, `string.digits` and
`!#$%&'*+-.^_`|~:` denote the set of valid characters allowed by this module
in Cookie name (as `key`).

Changed in version 3.3: Allowed ‘:’ as a valid Cookie name character.

Note

On encountering an invalid cookie, `CookieError` is raised, so if your cookie
data comes from a browser you should always prepare for invalid data and catch
`CookieError` on parsing.

`exception http.cookies.CookieError`

    
Exception failing because of RFC 2109 invalidity: incorrect attributes,
incorrect Set-Cookie header, etc.

`class http.cookies.BaseCookie([input])`

    
This class is a dictionary-like object whose keys are strings and whose values
are `Morsel` instances. Note that upon setting a key to a value, the value is
first converted to a `Morsel` containing the key and the value.

If input is given, it is passed to the `load()` method.

`class http.cookies.SimpleCookie([input])`

    
This class derives from `BaseCookie` and overrides `value_decode()` and
`value_encode()`. SimpleCookie supports strings as cookie values. When setting
the value, SimpleCookie calls the builtin `str()` to convert the value to a
string. Values received from HTTP are kept as strings.

`Module` `http.cookiejar`

    
HTTP cookie handling for web clients. The `http.cookiejar` and `http.cookies`
modules do not depend on each other.

RFC 2109 \- HTTP State Management Mechanism

    
This is the state management specification implemented by this module.

## Cookie Objects

`BaseCookie.value_decode(val)`

    
Return a tuple `(real_value, coded_value)` from a string representation.
`real_value` can be any type. This method does no decoding in `BaseCookie` —
it exists so it can be overridden.

`BaseCookie.value_encode(val)`

    
Return a tuple `(real_value, coded_value)`. val can be any type, but
`coded_value` will always be converted to a string. This method does no
encoding in `BaseCookie` — it exists so it can be overridden.

In general, it should be the case that `value_encode()` and `value_decode()`
are inverses on the range of value_decode.

`BaseCookie.output(attrs=None, header='Set-Cookie:', sep='\r\n')`

    
Return a string representation suitable to be sent as HTTP headers. attrs and
header are sent to each `Morsel`’s `output()` method. sep is used to join the
headers together, and is by default the combination `'\r\n'` (CRLF).

`BaseCookie.js_output(attrs=None)`

    
Return an embeddable JavaScript snippet, which, if run on a browser which
supports JavaScript, will act the same as if the HTTP headers was sent.

The meaning for attrs is the same as in `output()`.

`BaseCookie.load(rawdata)`

    
If rawdata is a string, parse it as an `HTTP_COOKIE` and add the values found
there as `Morsel`s. If it is a dictionary, it is equivalent to:

    
    for k, v in rawdata.items():
        cookie[k] = v
    
## Morsel Objects

`class http.cookies.Morsel`

    
Abstract a key/value pair, which has some RFC 2109 attributes.

Morsels are dictionary-like objects, whose set of keys is constant — the valid
RFC 2109 attributes, which are

  * `expires`
  * `path`
  * `comment`
  * `domain`
  * `max-age`
  * `secure`
  * `version`
  * `httponly`
  * `samesite`

The attribute `httponly` specifies that the cookie is only transferred in HTTP
requests, and is not accessible through JavaScript. This is intended to
mitigate some forms of cross-site scripting.

The attribute `samesite` specifies that the browser is not allowed to send the
cookie along with cross-site requests. This helps to mitigate CSRF attacks.
Valid values for this attribute are “Strict” and “Lax”.

The keys are case-insensitive and their default value is `''`.

Changed in version 3.5: `__eq__()` now takes `key` and `value` into account.

Changed in version 3.7: Attributes `key`, `value` and `coded_value` are read-
only. Use `set()` for setting them.

Changed in version 3.8: Added support for the `samesite` attribute.

`Morsel.value`

    
The value of the cookie.

`Morsel.coded_value`

    
The encoded value of the cookie — this is what should be sent.

`Morsel.key`

    
The name of the cookie.

`Morsel.set(key, value, coded_value)`

    
Set the key, value and coded_value attributes.

`Morsel.isReservedKey(K)`

    
Whether K is a member of the set of keys of a `Morsel`.

`Morsel.output(attrs=None, header='Set-Cookie:')`

    
Return a string representation of the Morsel, suitable to be sent as an HTTP
header. By default, all the attributes are included, unless attrs is given, in
which case it should be a list of attributes to use. header is by default
`"Set-Cookie:"`.

`Morsel.js_output(attrs=None)`

    
Return an embeddable JavaScript snippet, which, if run on a browser which
supports JavaScript, will act the same as if the HTTP header was sent.

The meaning for attrs is the same as in `output()`.

`Morsel.OutputString(attrs=None)`

    
Return a string representing the Morsel, without any surrounding HTTP or
JavaScript.

The meaning for attrs is the same as in `output()`.

`Morsel.update(values)`

    
Update the values in the Morsel dictionary with the values in the dictionary
values. Raise an error if any of the keys in the values dict is not a valid
RFC 2109 attribute.

Changed in version 3.5: an error is raised for invalid keys.

`Morsel.copy(value)`

    
Return a shallow copy of the Morsel object.

Changed in version 3.5: return a Morsel object instead of a dict.

`Morsel.setdefault(key, value=None)`

    
Raise an error if key is not a valid RFC 2109 attribute, otherwise behave the
same as `dict.setdefault()`.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the `http.cookies` module.

    
    >>> from http import cookies
    >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
    >>> C["fig"] = "newton"
    >>> C["sugar"] = "wafer"
    >>> print(C) # generate HTTP headers
    Set-Cookie: fig=newton
    Set-Cookie: sugar=wafer
    >>> print(C.output()) # same thing
    Set-Cookie: fig=newton
    Set-Cookie: sugar=wafer
    >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
    >>> C["rocky"] = "road"
    >>> C["rocky"]["path"] = "/cookie"
    >>> print(C.output(header="Cookie:"))
    Cookie: rocky=road; Path=/cookie
    >>> print(C.output(attrs=[], header="Cookie:"))
    Cookie: rocky=road
    >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
    >>> C.load("chips=ahoy; vienna=finger") # load from a string (HTTP header)
    >>> print(C)
    Set-Cookie: chips=ahoy
    Set-Cookie: vienna=finger
    >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
    >>> C.load('keebler="E=everybody; L=\\"Loves\\"; fudge=\\012;";')
    >>> print(C)
    Set-Cookie: keebler="E=everybody; L=\"Loves\"; fudge=\012;"
    >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
    >>> C["oreo"] = "doublestuff"
    >>> C["oreo"]["path"] = "/"
    >>> print(C)
    Set-Cookie: oreo=doublestuff; Path=/
    >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
    >>> C["twix"] = "none for you"
    >>> C["twix"].value
    'none for you'
    >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
    >>> C["number"] = 7 # equivalent to C["number"] = str(7)
    >>> C["string"] = "seven"
    >>> C["number"].value
    '7'
    >>> C["string"].value
    'seven'
    >>> print(C)
    Set-Cookie: number=7
    Set-Cookie: string=seven
