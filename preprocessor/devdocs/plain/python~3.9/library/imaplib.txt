# imaplib — IMAP4 protocol client

Source code: Lib/imaplib.py

This module defines three classes, `IMAP4`, `IMAP4_SSL` and `IMAP4_stream`,
which encapsulate a connection to an IMAP4 server and implement a large subset
of the IMAP4rev1 client protocol as defined in RFC 2060. It is backward
compatible with IMAP4 (RFC 1730) servers, but note that the `STATUS` command
is not supported in IMAP4.

Three classes are provided by the `imaplib` module, `IMAP4` is the base class:

`class imaplib.IMAP4(host='', port=IMAP4_PORT, timeout=None)`

    
This class implements the actual IMAP4 protocol. The connection is created and
protocol version (IMAP4 or IMAP4rev1) is determined when the instance is
initialized. If host is not specified, `''` (the local host) is used. If port
is omitted, the standard IMAP4 port (143) is used. The optional timeout
parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for the connection attempt. If
timeout is not given or is None, the global default socket timeout is used.

The `IMAP4` class supports the `with` statement. When used like this, the
IMAP4 `LOGOUT` command is issued automatically when the `with` statement
exits. E.g.:

    
    >>> from imaplib import IMAP4
    >>> with IMAP4("domain.org") as M:
    ...     M.noop()
    ...
    ('OK', [b'Nothing Accomplished. d25if65hy903weo.87'])
    
Changed in version 3.5: Support for the `with` statement was added.

Changed in version 3.9: The optional timeout parameter was added.

Three exceptions are defined as attributes of the `IMAP4` class:

`exception IMAP4.error`

    
Exception raised on any errors. The reason for the exception is passed to the
constructor as a string.

`exception IMAP4.abort`

    
IMAP4 server errors cause this exception to be raised. This is a sub-class of
`IMAP4.error`. Note that closing the instance and instantiating a new one will
usually allow recovery from this exception.

`exception IMAP4.readonly`

    
This exception is raised when a writable mailbox has its status changed by the
server. This is a sub-class of `IMAP4.error`. Some other client now has write
permission, and the mailbox will need to be re-opened to re-obtain write
permission.

There’s also a subclass for secure connections:

`class imaplib.IMAP4_SSL(host='', port=IMAP4_SSL_PORT, keyfile=None,
certfile=None, ssl_context=None, timeout=None)`

    
This is a subclass derived from `IMAP4` that connects over an SSL encrypted
socket (to use this class you need a socket module that was compiled with SSL
support). If host is not specified, `''` (the local host) is used. If port is
omitted, the standard IMAP4-over-SSL port (993) is used. ssl_context is a
`ssl.SSLContext` object which allows bundling SSL configuration options,
certificates and private keys into a single (potentially long-lived)
structure. Please read Security considerations for best practices.

keyfile and certfile are a legacy alternative to ssl_context \- they can point
to PEM-formatted private key and certificate chain files for the SSL
connection. Note that the keyfile/certfile parameters are mutually exclusive
with ssl_context, a `ValueError` is raised if keyfile/certfile is provided
along with ssl_context.

The optional timeout parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for the
connection attempt. If timeout is not given or is None, the global default
socket timeout is used.

Changed in version 3.3: ssl_context parameter was added.

Changed in version 3.4: The class now supports hostname check with
`ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname` and Server Name Indication (see
`ssl.HAS_SNI`).

Deprecated since version 3.6: keyfile and certfile are deprecated in favor of
ssl_context. Please use `ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain()` instead, or let
`ssl.create_default_context()` select the system’s trusted CA certificates for
you.

Changed in version 3.9: The optional timeout parameter was added.

The second subclass allows for connections created by a child process:

`class imaplib.IMAP4_stream(command)`

    
This is a subclass derived from `IMAP4` that connects to the `stdin/stdout`
file descriptors created by passing command to `subprocess.Popen()`.

The following utility functions are defined:

`imaplib.Internaldate2tuple(datestr)`

    
Parse an IMAP4 `INTERNALDATE` string and return corresponding local time. The
return value is a `time.struct_time` tuple or `None` if the string has wrong
format.

`imaplib.Int2AP(num)`

    
Converts an integer into a bytes representation using characters from the set
[`A` .. `P`].

`imaplib.ParseFlags(flagstr)`

    
Converts an IMAP4 `FLAGS` response to a tuple of individual flags.

`imaplib.Time2Internaldate(date_time)`

    
Convert date_time to an IMAP4 `INTERNALDATE` representation. The return value
is a string in the form: `"DD-Mmm-YYYY HH:MM:SS +HHMM"` (including double-
quotes). The date_time argument can be a number (int or float) representing
seconds since epoch (as returned by `time.time()`), a 9-tuple representing
local time an instance of `time.struct_time` (as returned by
`time.localtime()`), an aware instance of `datetime.datetime`, or a double-
quoted string. In the last case, it is assumed to already be in the correct
format.

Note that IMAP4 message numbers change as the mailbox changes; in particular,
after an `EXPUNGE` command performs deletions the remaining messages are
renumbered. So it is highly advisable to use UIDs instead, with the UID
command.

At the end of the module, there is a test section that contains a more
extensive example of usage.

## IMAP4 Objects

All IMAP4rev1 commands are represented by methods of the same name, either
upper-case or lower-case.

All arguments to commands are converted to strings, except for `AUTHENTICATE`,
and the last argument to `APPEND` which is passed as an IMAP4 literal. If
necessary (the string contains IMAP4 protocol-sensitive characters and isn’t
enclosed with either parentheses or double quotes) each string is quoted.
However, the password argument to the `LOGIN` command is always quoted. If you
want to avoid having an argument string quoted (eg: the flags argument to
`STORE`) then enclose the string in parentheses (eg: `r'(\Deleted)'`).

Each command returns a tuple: `(type, [data, ...])` where type is usually
`'OK'` or `'NO'`, and data is either the text from the command response, or
mandated results from the command. Each data is either a `bytes`, or a tuple.
If a tuple, then the first part is the header of the response, and the second
part contains the data (ie: ‘literal’ value).

The message_set options to commands below is a string specifying one or more
messages to be acted upon. It may be a simple message number (`'1'`), a range
of message numbers (`'2:4'`), or a group of non-contiguous ranges separated by
commas (`'1:3,6:9'`). A range can contain an asterisk to indicate an infinite
upper bound (`'3:*'`).

An `IMAP4` instance has the following methods:

`IMAP4.append(mailbox, flags, date_time, message)`

    
Append message to named mailbox.

`IMAP4.authenticate(mechanism, authobject)`

    
Authenticate command — requires response processing.

mechanism specifies which authentication mechanism is to be used - it should
appear in the instance variable `capabilities` in the form `AUTH=mechanism`.

authobject must be a callable object:

    
    data = authobject(response)
    
It will be called to process server continuation responses; the response
argument it is passed will be `bytes`. It should return `bytes` data that will
be base64 encoded and sent to the server. It should return `None` if the
client abort response `*` should be sent instead.

Changed in version 3.5: string usernames and passwords are now encoded to
`utf-8` instead of being limited to ASCII.

`IMAP4.check()`

    
Checkpoint mailbox on server.

`IMAP4.close()`

    
Close currently selected mailbox. Deleted messages are removed from writable
mailbox. This is the recommended command before `LOGOUT`.

`IMAP4.copy(message_set, new_mailbox)`

    
Copy message_set messages onto end of new_mailbox.

`IMAP4.create(mailbox)`

    
Create new mailbox named mailbox.

`IMAP4.delete(mailbox)`

    
Delete old mailbox named mailbox.

`IMAP4.deleteacl(mailbox, who)`

    
Delete the ACLs (remove any rights) set for who on mailbox.

`IMAP4.enable(capability)`

    
Enable capability (see RFC 5161). Most capabilities do not need to be enabled.
Currently only the `UTF8=ACCEPT` capability is supported (see RFC 6855).

New in version 3.5: The `enable()` method itself, and RFC 6855 support.

`IMAP4.expunge()`

    
Permanently remove deleted items from selected mailbox. Generates an `EXPUNGE`
response for each deleted message. Returned data contains a list of `EXPUNGE`
message numbers in order received.

`IMAP4.fetch(message_set, message_parts)`

    
Fetch (parts of) messages. message_parts should be a string of message part
names enclosed within parentheses, eg: `"(UID BODY[TEXT])"`. Returned data are
tuples of message part envelope and data.

`IMAP4.getacl(mailbox)`

    
Get the `ACL`s for mailbox. The method is non-standard, but is supported by
the `Cyrus` server.

`IMAP4.getannotation(mailbox, entry, attribute)`

    
Retrieve the specified `ANNOTATION`s for mailbox. The method is non-standard,
but is supported by the `Cyrus` server.

`IMAP4.getquota(root)`

    
Get the `quota` root’s resource usage and limits. This method is part of the
IMAP4 QUOTA extension defined in rfc2087.

`IMAP4.getquotaroot(mailbox)`

    
Get the list of `quota` `roots` for the named mailbox. This method is part of
the IMAP4 QUOTA extension defined in rfc2087.

`IMAP4.list([directory[, pattern]])`

    
List mailbox names in directory matching pattern. directory defaults to the
top-level mail folder, and pattern defaults to match anything. Returned data
contains a list of `LIST` responses.

`IMAP4.login(user, password)`

    
Identify the client using a plaintext password. The password will be quoted.

`IMAP4.login_cram_md5(user, password)`

    
Force use of `CRAM-MD5` authentication when identifying the client to protect
the password. Will only work if the server `CAPABILITY` response includes the
phrase `AUTH=CRAM-MD5`.

`IMAP4.logout()`

    
Shutdown connection to server. Returns server `BYE` response.

Changed in version 3.8: The method no longer ignores silently arbitrary
exceptions.

`IMAP4.lsub(directory='""', pattern='*')`

    
List subscribed mailbox names in directory matching pattern. directory
defaults to the top level directory and pattern defaults to match any mailbox.
Returned data are tuples of message part envelope and data.

`IMAP4.myrights(mailbox)`

    
Show my ACLs for a mailbox (i.e. the rights that I have on mailbox).

`IMAP4.namespace()`

    
Returns IMAP namespaces as defined in RFC 2342.

`IMAP4.noop()`

    
Send `NOOP` to server.

`IMAP4.open(host, port, timeout=None)`

    
Opens socket to port at host. The optional timeout parameter specifies a
timeout in seconds for the connection attempt. If timeout is not given or is
None, the global default socket timeout is used. Also note that if the timeout
parameter is set to be zero, it will raise a `ValueError` to reject creating a
non-blocking socket. This method is implicitly called by the `IMAP4`
constructor. The connection objects established by this method will be used in
the `IMAP4.read()`, `IMAP4.readline()`, `IMAP4.send()`, and `IMAP4.shutdown()`
methods. You may override this method.

Raises an auditing event `imaplib.open` with arguments `self`, `host`, `port`.

Changed in version 3.9: The timeout parameter was added.

`IMAP4.partial(message_num, message_part, start, length)`

    
Fetch truncated part of a message. Returned data is a tuple of message part
envelope and data.

`IMAP4.proxyauth(user)`

    
Assume authentication as user. Allows an authorised administrator to proxy
into any user’s mailbox.

`IMAP4.read(size)`

    
Reads size bytes from the remote server. You may override this method.

`IMAP4.readline()`

    
Reads one line from the remote server. You may override this method.

`IMAP4.recent()`

    
Prompt server for an update. Returned data is `None` if no new messages, else
value of `RECENT` response.

`IMAP4.rename(oldmailbox, newmailbox)`

    
Rename mailbox named oldmailbox to newmailbox.

`IMAP4.response(code)`

    
Return data for response code if received, or `None`. Returns the given code,
instead of the usual type.

`IMAP4.search(charset, criterion[, ...])`

    
Search mailbox for matching messages. charset may be `None`, in which case no
`CHARSET` will be specified in the request to the server. The IMAP protocol
requires that at least one criterion be specified; an exception will be raised
when the server returns an error. charset must be `None` if the `UTF8=ACCEPT`
capability was enabled using the `enable()` command.

Example:

    
    # M is a connected IMAP4 instance...
    typ, msgnums = M.search(None, 'FROM', '"LDJ"')
    
    # or:
    typ, msgnums = M.search(None, '(FROM "LDJ")')
    
`IMAP4.select(mailbox='INBOX', readonly=False)`

    
Select a mailbox. Returned data is the count of messages in mailbox (`EXISTS`
response). The default mailbox is `'INBOX'`. If the readonly flag is set,
modifications to the mailbox are not allowed.

`IMAP4.send(data)`

    
Sends `data` to the remote server. You may override this method.

Raises an auditing event `imaplib.send` with arguments `self`, `data`.

`IMAP4.setacl(mailbox, who, what)`

    
Set an `ACL` for mailbox. The method is non-standard, but is supported by the
`Cyrus` server.

`IMAP4.setannotation(mailbox, entry, attribute[, ...])`

    
Set `ANNOTATION`s for mailbox. The method is non-standard, but is supported by
the `Cyrus` server.

`IMAP4.setquota(root, limits)`

    
Set the `quota` root’s resource limits. This method is part of the IMAP4 QUOTA
extension defined in rfc2087.

`IMAP4.shutdown()`

    
Close connection established in `open`. This method is implicitly called by
`IMAP4.logout()`. You may override this method.

`IMAP4.socket()`

    
Returns socket instance used to connect to server.

`IMAP4.sort(sort_criteria, charset, search_criterion[, ...])`

    
The `sort` command is a variant of `search` with sorting semantics for the
results. Returned data contains a space separated list of matching message
numbers.

Sort has two arguments before the search_criterion argument(s); a
parenthesized list of sort_criteria, and the searching charset. Note that
unlike `search`, the searching charset argument is mandatory. There is also a
`uid sort` command which corresponds to `sort` the way that `uid search`
corresponds to `search`. The `sort` command first searches the mailbox for
messages that match the given searching criteria using the charset argument
for the interpretation of strings in the searching criteria. It then returns
the numbers of matching messages.

This is an `IMAP4rev1` extension command.

`IMAP4.starttls(ssl_context=None)`

    
Send a `STARTTLS` command. The ssl_context argument is optional and should be
a `ssl.SSLContext` object. This will enable encryption on the IMAP connection.
Please read Security considerations for best practices.

New in version 3.2.

Changed in version 3.4: The method now supports hostname check with
`ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname` and Server Name Indication (see
`ssl.HAS_SNI`).

`IMAP4.status(mailbox, names)`

    
Request named status conditions for mailbox.

`IMAP4.store(message_set, command, flag_list)`

    
Alters flag dispositions for messages in mailbox. command is specified by
section 6.4.6 of RFC 2060 as being one of “FLAGS”, “+FLAGS”, or “-FLAGS”,
optionally with a suffix of “.SILENT”.

For example, to set the delete flag on all messages:

    
    typ, data = M.search(None, 'ALL')
    for num in data[0].split():
       M.store(num, '+FLAGS', '\\Deleted')
    M.expunge()
    
Note

Creating flags containing ‘]’ (for example: “[test]”) violates RFC 3501 (the
IMAP protocol). However, imaplib has historically allowed creation of such
tags, and popular IMAP servers, such as Gmail, accept and produce such flags.
There are non-Python programs which also create such tags. Although it is an
RFC violation and IMAP clients and servers are supposed to be strict, imaplib
nonetheless continues to allow such tags to be created for backward
compatibility reasons, and as of Python 3.6, handles them if they are sent
from the server, since this improves real-world compatibility.

`IMAP4.subscribe(mailbox)`

    
Subscribe to new mailbox.

`IMAP4.thread(threading_algorithm, charset, search_criterion[, ...])`

    
The `thread` command is a variant of `search` with threading semantics for the
results. Returned data contains a space separated list of thread members.

Thread members consist of zero or more messages numbers, delimited by spaces,
indicating successive parent and child.

Thread has two arguments before the search_criterion argument(s); a
threading_algorithm, and the searching charset. Note that unlike `search`, the
searching charset argument is mandatory. There is also a `uid thread` command
which corresponds to `thread` the way that `uid search` corresponds to
`search`. The `thread` command first searches the mailbox for messages that
match the given searching criteria using the charset argument for the
interpretation of strings in the searching criteria. It then returns the
matching messages threaded according to the specified threading algorithm.

This is an `IMAP4rev1` extension command.

`IMAP4.uid(command, arg[, ...])`

    
Execute command args with messages identified by UID, rather than message
number. Returns response appropriate to command. At least one argument must be
supplied; if none are provided, the server will return an error and an
exception will be raised.

`IMAP4.unsubscribe(mailbox)`

    
Unsubscribe from old mailbox.

`IMAP4.unselect()`

    
`imaplib.IMAP4.unselect()` frees server’s resources associated with the
selected mailbox and returns the server to the authenticated state. This
command performs the same actions as `imaplib.IMAP4.close()`, except that no
messages are permanently removed from the currently selected mailbox.

New in version 3.9.

`IMAP4.xatom(name[, ...])`

    
Allow simple extension commands notified by server in `CAPABILITY` response.

The following attributes are defined on instances of `IMAP4`:

`IMAP4.PROTOCOL_VERSION`

    
The most recent supported protocol in the `CAPABILITY` response from the
server.

`IMAP4.debug`

    
Integer value to control debugging output. The initialize value is taken from
the module variable `Debug`. Values greater than three trace each command.

`IMAP4.utf8_enabled`

    
Boolean value that is normally `False`, but is set to `True` if an `enable()`
command is successfully issued for the `UTF8=ACCEPT` capability.

New in version 3.5.

## IMAP4 Example

Here is a minimal example (without error checking) that opens a mailbox and
retrieves and prints all messages:

    
    import getpass, imaplib
    
    M = imaplib.IMAP4()
    M.login(getpass.getuser(), getpass.getpass())
    M.select()
    typ, data = M.search(None, 'ALL')
    for num in data[0].split():
        typ, data = M.fetch(num, '(RFC822)')
        print('Message %s\n%s\n' % (num, data[0][1]))
    M.close()
    M.logout()
