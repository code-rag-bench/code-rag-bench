# fractions — Rational numbers

Source code: Lib/fractions.py

The `fractions` module provides support for rational number arithmetic.

A Fraction instance can be constructed from a pair of integers, from another
rational number, or from a string.

`class fractions.Fraction(numerator=0, denominator=1)`

`class fractions.Fraction(other_fraction)`

`class fractions.Fraction(float)`

`class fractions.Fraction(decimal)`

`class fractions.Fraction(string)`

    
The first version requires that numerator and denominator are instances of
`numbers.Rational` and returns a new `Fraction` instance with value
`numerator/denominator`. If denominator is `0`, it raises a
`ZeroDivisionError`. The second version requires that other_fraction is an
instance of `numbers.Rational` and returns a `Fraction` instance with the same
value. The next two versions accept either a `float` or a `decimal.Decimal`
instance, and return a `Fraction` instance with exactly the same value. Note
that due to the usual issues with binary floating-point (see Floating Point
Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations), the argument to `Fraction(1.1)` is not
exactly equal to 11/10, and so `Fraction(1.1)` does not return `Fraction(11,
10)` as one might expect. (But see the documentation for the
`limit_denominator()` method below.) The last version of the constructor
expects a string or unicode instance. The usual form for this instance is:

    
    [sign] numerator ['/' denominator]
    
where the optional `sign` may be either ‘+’ or ‘-‘ and `numerator` and
`denominator` (if present) are strings of decimal digits. In addition, any
string that represents a finite value and is accepted by the `float`
constructor is also accepted by the `Fraction` constructor. In either form the
input string may also have leading and/or trailing whitespace. Here are some
examples:

    
    >>> from fractions import Fraction
    >>> Fraction(16, -10)
    Fraction(-8, 5)
    >>> Fraction(123)
    Fraction(123, 1)
    >>> Fraction()
    Fraction(0, 1)
    >>> Fraction('3/7')
    Fraction(3, 7)
    >>> Fraction(' -3/7 ')
    Fraction(-3, 7)
    >>> Fraction('1.414213 \t\n')
    Fraction(1414213, 1000000)
    >>> Fraction('-.125')
    Fraction(-1, 8)
    >>> Fraction('7e-6')
    Fraction(7, 1000000)
    >>> Fraction(2.25)
    Fraction(9, 4)
    >>> Fraction(1.1)
    Fraction(2476979795053773, 2251799813685248)
    >>> from decimal import Decimal
    >>> Fraction(Decimal('1.1'))
    Fraction(11, 10)
    
The `Fraction` class inherits from the abstract base class `numbers.Rational`,
and implements all of the methods and operations from that class. `Fraction`
instances are hashable, and should be treated as immutable. In addition,
`Fraction` has the following properties and methods:

Changed in version 3.2: The `Fraction` constructor now accepts `float` and
`decimal.Decimal` instances.

Changed in version 3.9: The `math.gcd()` function is now used to normalize the
numerator and denominator. `math.gcd()` always return a `int` type.
Previously, the GCD type depended on numerator and denominator.

`numerator`

    
Numerator of the Fraction in lowest term.

`denominator`

    
Denominator of the Fraction in lowest term.

`as_integer_ratio()`

    
Return a tuple of two integers, whose ratio is equal to the Fraction and with
a positive denominator.

New in version 3.8.

`from_float(flt)`

    
This class method constructs a `Fraction` representing the exact value of flt,
which must be a `float`. Beware that `Fraction.from_float(0.3)` is not the
same value as `Fraction(3, 10)`.

Note

From Python 3.2 onwards, you can also construct a `Fraction` instance directly
from a `float`.

`from_decimal(dec)`

    
This class method constructs a `Fraction` representing the exact value of dec,
which must be a `decimal.Decimal` instance.

Note

From Python 3.2 onwards, you can also construct a `Fraction` instance directly
from a `decimal.Decimal` instance.

`limit_denominator(max_denominator=1000000)`

    
Finds and returns the closest `Fraction` to `self` that has denominator at
most max_denominator. This method is useful for finding rational
approximations to a given floating-point number:

    
    >>> from fractions import Fraction
    >>> Fraction('3.1415926535897932').limit_denominator(1000)
    Fraction(355, 113)
    
or for recovering a rational number that’s represented as a float:

    
    >>> from math import pi, cos
    >>> Fraction(cos(pi/3))
    Fraction(4503599627370497, 9007199254740992)
    >>> Fraction(cos(pi/3)).limit_denominator()
    Fraction(1, 2)
    >>> Fraction(1.1).limit_denominator()
    Fraction(11, 10)
    
`__floor__()`

    
Returns the greatest `int` `<= self`. This method can also be accessed through
the `math.floor()` function:

    
    >>> from math import floor
    >>> floor(Fraction(355, 113))
    3
    
`__ceil__()`

    
Returns the least `int` `>= self`. This method can also be accessed through
the `math.ceil()` function.

`__round__()`

`__round__(ndigits)`

    
The first version returns the nearest `int` to `self`, rounding half to even.
The second version rounds `self` to the nearest multiple of `Fraction(1,
10**ndigits)` (logically, if `ndigits` is negative), again rounding half
toward even. This method can also be accessed through the `round()` function.
