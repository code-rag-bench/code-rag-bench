# trace — Trace or track Python statement execution

Source code: Lib/trace.py

The `trace` module allows you to trace program execution, generate annotated
statement coverage listings, print caller/callee relationships and list
functions executed during a program run. It can be used in another program or
from the command line.

See also

Coverage.py

    
A popular third-party coverage tool that provides HTML output along with
advanced features such as branch coverage.

## Command-Line Usage

The `trace` module can be invoked from the command line. It can be as simple
as

    
    python -m trace --count -C . somefile.py ...
    
The above will execute `somefile.py` and generate annotated listings of all
Python modules imported during the execution into the current directory.

`--help`

    
Display usage and exit.

`--version`

    
Display the version of the module and exit.

New in version 3.8: Added `--module` option that allows to run an executable
module.

### Main options

At least one of the following options must be specified when invoking `trace`.
The `--listfuncs` option is mutually exclusive with the `--trace` and
`--count` options. When `--listfuncs` is provided, neither `--count` nor
`--trace` are accepted, and vice versa.

`-c, --count`

    
Produce a set of annotated listing files upon program completion that shows
how many times each statement was executed. See also `--coverdir`, `--file`
and `--no-report` below.

`-t, --trace`

    
Display lines as they are executed.

`-l, --listfuncs`

    
Display the functions executed by running the program.

`-r, --report`

    
Produce an annotated list from an earlier program run that used the `--count`
and `--file` option. This does not execute any code.

`-T, --trackcalls`

    
Display the calling relationships exposed by running the program.

### Modifiers

`-f, --file=<file>`

    
Name of a file to accumulate counts over several tracing runs. Should be used
with the `--count` option.

`-C, --coverdir=<dir>`

    
Directory where the report files go. The coverage report for `package.module`
is written to file `dir/package/module.cover`.

`-m, --missing`

    
When generating annotated listings, mark lines which were not executed with
`>>>>>>`.

`-s, --summary`

    
When using `--count` or `--report`, write a brief summary to stdout for each
file processed.

`-R, --no-report`

    
Do not generate annotated listings. This is useful if you intend to make
several runs with `--count`, and then produce a single set of annotated
listings at the end.

`-g, --timing`

    
Prefix each line with the time since the program started. Only used while
tracing.

### Filters

These options may be repeated multiple times.

`--ignore-module=<mod>`

    
Ignore each of the given module names and its submodules (if it is a package).
The argument can be a list of names separated by a comma.

`--ignore-dir=<dir>`

    
Ignore all modules and packages in the named directory and subdirectories. The
argument can be a list of directories separated by `os.pathsep`.

## Programmatic Interface

`class trace.Trace(count=1, trace=1, countfuncs=0, countcallers=0,
ignoremods=(), ignoredirs=(), infile=None, outfile=None, timing=False)`

    
Create an object to trace execution of a single statement or expression. All
parameters are optional. count enables counting of line numbers. trace enables
line execution tracing. countfuncs enables listing of the functions called
during the run. countcallers enables call relationship tracking. ignoremods is
a list of modules or packages to ignore. ignoredirs is a list of directories
whose modules or packages should be ignored. infile is the name of the file
from which to read stored count information. outfile is the name of the file
in which to write updated count information. timing enables a timestamp
relative to when tracing was started to be displayed.

`run(cmd)`

    
Execute the command and gather statistics from the execution with the current
tracing parameters. cmd must be a string or code object, suitable for passing
into `exec()`.

`runctx(cmd, globals=None, locals=None)`

    
Execute the command and gather statistics from the execution with the current
tracing parameters, in the defined global and local environments. If not
defined, globals and locals default to empty dictionaries.

`runfunc(func, /, *args, **kwds)`

    
Call func with the given arguments under control of the `Trace` object with
the current tracing parameters.

`results()`

    
Return a `CoverageResults` object that contains the cumulative results of all
previous calls to `run`, `runctx` and `runfunc` for the given `Trace`
instance. Does not reset the accumulated trace results.

`class trace.CoverageResults`

    
A container for coverage results, created by `Trace.results()`. Should not be
created directly by the user.

`update(other)`

    
Merge in data from another `CoverageResults` object.

`write_results(show_missing=True, summary=False, coverdir=None)`

    
Write coverage results. Set show_missing to show lines that had no hits. Set
summary to include in the output the coverage summary per module. coverdir
specifies the directory into which the coverage result files will be output.
If `None`, the results for each source file are placed in its directory.

A simple example demonstrating the use of the programmatic interface:

    
    import sys
    import trace
    
    # create a Trace object, telling it what to ignore, and whether to
    # do tracing or line-counting or both.
    tracer = trace.Trace(
        ignoredirs=[sys.prefix, sys.exec_prefix],
        trace=0,
        count=1)
    
    # run the new command using the given tracer
    tracer.run('main()')
    
    # make a report, placing output in the current directory
    r = tracer.results()
    r.write_results(show_missing=True, coverdir=".")
