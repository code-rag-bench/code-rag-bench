# collections.abc — Abstract Base Classes for Containers

New in version 3.3: Formerly, this module was part of the `collections`
module.

Source code: Lib/_collections_abc.py

This module provides abstract base classes that can be used to test whether a
class provides a particular interface; for example, whether it is hashable or
whether it is a mapping.

## Collections Abstract Base Classes

The collections module offers the following ABCs:

`class collections.abc.Container`

    
ABC for classes that provide the `__contains__()` method.

`class collections.abc.Hashable`

    
ABC for classes that provide the `__hash__()` method.

`class collections.abc.Sized`

    
ABC for classes that provide the `__len__()` method.

`class collections.abc.Callable`

    
ABC for classes that provide the `__call__()` method.

`class collections.abc.Iterable`

    
ABC for classes that provide the `__iter__()` method.

Checking `isinstance(obj, Iterable)` detects classes that are registered as
`Iterable` or that have an `__iter__()` method, but it does not detect classes
that iterate with the `__getitem__()` method. The only reliable way to
determine whether an object is iterable is to call `iter(obj)`.

`class collections.abc.Collection`

    
ABC for sized iterable container classes.

New in version 3.6.

`class collections.abc.Iterator`

    
ABC for classes that provide the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. See
also the definition of iterator.

`class collections.abc.Reversible`

    
ABC for iterable classes that also provide the `__reversed__()` method.

New in version 3.6.

`class collections.abc.Generator`

    
ABC for generator classes that implement the protocol defined in PEP 342 that
extends iterators with the `send()`, `throw()` and `close()` methods. See also
the definition of generator.

New in version 3.5.

`class collections.abc.Sequence`

`class collections.abc.MutableSequence`

`class collections.abc.ByteString`

    
ABCs for read-only and mutable sequences.

Implementation note: Some of the mixin methods, such as `__iter__()`,
`__reversed__()` and `index()`, make repeated calls to the underlying
`__getitem__()` method. Consequently, if `__getitem__()` is implemented with
constant access speed, the mixin methods will have linear performance;
however, if the underlying method is linear (as it would be with a linked
list), the mixins will have quadratic performance and will likely need to be
overridden.

Changed in version 3.5: The index() method added support for stop and start
arguments.

`class collections.abc.Set`

`class collections.abc.MutableSet`

    
ABCs for read-only and mutable sets.

`class collections.abc.Mapping`

`class collections.abc.MutableMapping`

    
ABCs for read-only and mutable mappings.

`class collections.abc.MappingView`

`class collections.abc.ItemsView`

`class collections.abc.KeysView`

`class collections.abc.ValuesView`

    
ABCs for mapping, items, keys, and values views.

`class collections.abc.Awaitable`

    
ABC for awaitable objects, which can be used in `await` expressions. Custom
implementations must provide the `__await__()` method.

Coroutine objects and instances of the `Coroutine` ABC are all instances of
this ABC.

Note

In CPython, generator-based coroutines (generators decorated with
`types.coroutine()` or `asyncio.coroutine()`) are awaitables, even though they
do not have an `__await__()` method. Using `isinstance(gencoro, Awaitable)`
for them will return `False`. Use `inspect.isawaitable()` to detect them.

New in version 3.5.

`class collections.abc.Coroutine`

    
ABC for coroutine compatible classes. These implement the following methods,
defined in Coroutine Objects: `send()`, `throw()`, and `close()`. Custom
implementations must also implement `__await__()`. All `Coroutine` instances
are also instances of `Awaitable`. See also the definition of coroutine.

Note

In CPython, generator-based coroutines (generators decorated with
`types.coroutine()` or `asyncio.coroutine()`) are awaitables, even though they
do not have an `__await__()` method. Using `isinstance(gencoro, Coroutine)`
for them will return `False`. Use `inspect.isawaitable()` to detect them.

New in version 3.5.

`class collections.abc.AsyncIterable`

    
ABC for classes that provide `__aiter__` method. See also the definition of
asynchronous iterable.

New in version 3.5.

`class collections.abc.AsyncIterator`

    
ABC for classes that provide `__aiter__` and `__anext__` methods. See also the
definition of asynchronous iterator.

New in version 3.5.

`class collections.abc.AsyncGenerator`

    
ABC for asynchronous generator classes that implement the protocol defined in
PEP 525 and PEP 492.

New in version 3.6.

These ABCs allow us to ask classes or instances if they provide particular
functionality, for example:

    
    size = None
    if isinstance(myvar, collections.abc.Sized):
        size = len(myvar)
    
Several of the ABCs are also useful as mixins that make it easier to develop
classes supporting container APIs. For example, to write a class supporting
the full `Set` API, it is only necessary to supply the three underlying
abstract methods: `__contains__()`, `__iter__()`, and `__len__()`. The ABC
supplies the remaining methods such as `__and__()` and `isdisjoint()`:

    
    class ListBasedSet(collections.abc.Set):
        ''' Alternate set implementation favoring space over speed
            and not requiring the set elements to be hashable. '''
        def __init__(self, iterable):
            self.elements = lst = []
            for value in iterable:
                if value not in lst:
                    lst.append(value)
    
        def __iter__(self):
            return iter(self.elements)
    
        def __contains__(self, value):
            return value in self.elements
    
        def __len__(self):
            return len(self.elements)
    
    s1 = ListBasedSet('abcdef')
    s2 = ListBasedSet('defghi')
    overlap = s1 & s2            # The __and__() method is supported automatically
    
Notes on using `Set` and `MutableSet` as a mixin:

  1. Since some set operations create new sets, the default mixin methods need a way to create new instances from an iterable. The class constructor is assumed to have a signature in the form `ClassName(iterable)`. That assumption is factored-out to an internal classmethod called `_from_iterable()` which calls `cls(iterable)` to produce a new set. If the `Set` mixin is being used in a class with a different constructor signature, you will need to override `_from_iterable()` with a classmethod or regular method that can construct new instances from an iterable argument.
  2. To override the comparisons (presumably for speed, as the semantics are fixed), redefine `__le__()` and `__ge__()`, then the other operations will automatically follow suit.
  3. The `Set` mixin provides a `_hash()` method to compute a hash value for the set; however, `__hash__()` is not defined because not all sets are hashable or immutable. To add set hashability using mixins, inherit from both `Set()` and `Hashable()`, then define `__hash__ = Set._hash`.
