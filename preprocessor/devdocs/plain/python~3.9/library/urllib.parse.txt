# urllib.parse — Parse URLs into components

Source code: Lib/urllib/parse.py

This module defines a standard interface to break Uniform Resource Locator
(URL) strings up in components (addressing scheme, network location, path
etc.), to combine the components back into a URL string, and to convert a
“relative URL” to an absolute URL given a “base URL.”

The module has been designed to match the Internet RFC on Relative Uniform
Resource Locators. It supports the following URL schemes: `file`, `ftp`,
`gopher`, `hdl`, `http`, `https`, `imap`, `mailto`, `mms`, `news`, `nntp`,
`prospero`, `rsync`, `rtsp`, `rtspu`, `sftp`, `shttp`, `sip`, `sips`, `snews`,
`svn`, `svn+ssh`, `telnet`, `wais`, `ws`, `wss`.

The `urllib.parse` module defines functions that fall into two broad
categories: URL parsing and URL quoting. These are covered in detail in the
following sections.

## URL Parsing

The URL parsing functions focus on splitting a URL string into its components,
or on combining URL components into a URL string.

`urllib.parse.urlparse(urlstring, scheme='', allow_fragments=True)`

    
Parse a URL into six components, returning a 6-item named tuple. This
corresponds to the general structure of a URL:
`scheme://netloc/path;parameters?query#fragment`. Each tuple item is a string,
possibly empty. The components are not broken up into smaller parts (for
example, the network location is a single string), and % escapes are not
expanded. The delimiters as shown above are not part of the result, except for
a leading slash in the path component, which is retained if present. For
example:

    
    >>> from urllib.parse import urlparse
    >>> o = urlparse('http://www.cwi.nl:80/%7Eguido/Python.html')
    >>> o   
    ParseResult(scheme='http', netloc='www.cwi.nl:80', path='/%7Eguido/Python.html',
                params='', query='', fragment='')
    >>> o.scheme
    'http'
    >>> o.port
    80
    >>> o.geturl()
    'http://www.cwi.nl:80/%7Eguido/Python.html'
    
Following the syntax specifications in RFC 1808, urlparse recognizes a netloc
only if it is properly introduced by ‘//’. Otherwise the input is presumed to
be a relative URL and thus to start with a path component.

    
    >>> from urllib.parse import urlparse
    >>> urlparse('//www.cwi.nl:80/%7Eguido/Python.html')
    ParseResult(scheme='', netloc='www.cwi.nl:80', path='/%7Eguido/Python.html',
                params='', query='', fragment='')
    >>> urlparse('www.cwi.nl/%7Eguido/Python.html')
    ParseResult(scheme='', netloc='', path='www.cwi.nl/%7Eguido/Python.html',
                params='', query='', fragment='')
    >>> urlparse('help/Python.html')
    ParseResult(scheme='', netloc='', path='help/Python.html', params='',
                query='', fragment='')
    
The scheme argument gives the default addressing scheme, to be used only if
the URL does not specify one. It should be the same type (text or bytes) as
urlstring, except that the default value `''` is always allowed, and is
automatically converted to `b''` if appropriate.

If the allow_fragments argument is false, fragment identifiers are not
recognized. Instead, they are parsed as part of the path, parameters or query
component, and `fragment` is set to the empty string in the return value.

The return value is a named tuple, which means that its items can be accessed
by index or as named attributes, which are:

Attribute | Index | Value | Value if not present  
---|---|---|---  
`scheme` | 0 | URL scheme specifier | scheme parameter  
`netloc` | 1 | Network location part | empty string  
`path` | 2 | Hierarchical path | empty string  
`params` | 3 | Parameters for last path element | empty string  
`query` | 4 | Query component | empty string  
`fragment` | 5 | Fragment identifier | empty string  
`username` |  | User name | `None`  
`password` |  | Password | `None`  
`hostname` |  | Host name (lower case) | `None`  
`port` |  | Port number as integer, if present | `None`  
Reading the `port` attribute will raise a `ValueError` if an invalid port is
specified in the URL. See section Structured Parse Results for more
information on the result object.

Unmatched square brackets in the `netloc` attribute will raise a `ValueError`.

Characters in the `netloc` attribute that decompose under NFKC normalization
(as used by the IDNA encoding) into any of `/`, `?`, `#`, `@`, or `:` will
raise a `ValueError`. If the URL is decomposed before parsing, no error will
be raised.

As is the case with all named tuples, the subclass has a few additional
methods and attributes that are particularly useful. One such method is
`_replace()`. The `_replace()` method will return a new ParseResult object
replacing specified fields with new values.

    
    >>> from urllib.parse import urlparse
    >>> u = urlparse('//www.cwi.nl:80/%7Eguido/Python.html')
    >>> u
    ParseResult(scheme='', netloc='www.cwi.nl:80', path='/%7Eguido/Python.html',
                params='', query='', fragment='')
    >>> u._replace(scheme='http')
    ParseResult(scheme='http', netloc='www.cwi.nl:80', path='/%7Eguido/Python.html',
                params='', query='', fragment='')
    
Changed in version 3.2: Added IPv6 URL parsing capabilities.

Changed in version 3.3: The fragment is now parsed for all URL schemes (unless
allow_fragment is false), in accordance with RFC 3986. Previously, a whitelist
of schemes that support fragments existed.

Changed in version 3.6: Out-of-range port numbers now raise `ValueError`,
instead of returning `None`.

Changed in version 3.8: Characters that affect netloc parsing under NFKC
normalization will now raise `ValueError`.

`urllib.parse.parse_qs(qs, keep_blank_values=False, strict_parsing=False,
encoding='utf-8', errors='replace', max_num_fields=None, separator='&')`

    
Parse a query string given as a string argument (data of type
application/x-www-form-urlencoded). Data are returned as a dictionary. The
dictionary keys are the unique query variable names and the values are lists
of values for each name.

The optional argument keep_blank_values is a flag indicating whether blank
values in percent-encoded queries should be treated as blank strings. A true
value indicates that blanks should be retained as blank strings. The default
false value indicates that blank values are to be ignored and treated as if
they were not included.

The optional argument strict_parsing is a flag indicating what to do with
parsing errors. If false (the default), errors are silently ignored. If true,
errors raise a `ValueError` exception.

The optional encoding and errors parameters specify how to decode percent-
encoded sequences into Unicode characters, as accepted by the `bytes.decode()`
method.

The optional argument max_num_fields is the maximum number of fields to read.
If set, then throws a `ValueError` if there are more than max_num_fields
fields read.

The optional argument separator is the symbol to use for separating the query
arguments. It defaults to `&`.

Use the `urllib.parse.urlencode()` function (with the `doseq` parameter set to
`True`) to convert such dictionaries into query strings.

Changed in version 3.2: Add encoding and errors parameters.

Changed in version 3.8: Added max_num_fields parameter.

Changed in version 3.9.2: Added separator parameter with the default value of
`&`. Python versions earlier than Python 3.9.2 allowed using both `;` and `&`
as query parameter separator. This has been changed to allow only a single
separator key, with `&` as the default separator.

`urllib.parse.parse_qsl(qs, keep_blank_values=False, strict_parsing=False,
encoding='utf-8', errors='replace', max_num_fields=None, separator='&')`

    
Parse a query string given as a string argument (data of type
application/x-www-form-urlencoded). Data are returned as a list of name, value
pairs.

The optional argument keep_blank_values is a flag indicating whether blank
values in percent-encoded queries should be treated as blank strings. A true
value indicates that blanks should be retained as blank strings. The default
false value indicates that blank values are to be ignored and treated as if
they were not included.

The optional argument strict_parsing is a flag indicating what to do with
parsing errors. If false (the default), errors are silently ignored. If true,
errors raise a `ValueError` exception.

The optional encoding and errors parameters specify how to decode percent-
encoded sequences into Unicode characters, as accepted by the `bytes.decode()`
method.

The optional argument max_num_fields is the maximum number of fields to read.
If set, then throws a `ValueError` if there are more than max_num_fields
fields read.

The optional argument separator is the symbol to use for separating the query
arguments. It defaults to `&`.

Use the `urllib.parse.urlencode()` function to convert such lists of pairs
into query strings.

Changed in version 3.2: Add encoding and errors parameters.

Changed in version 3.8: Added max_num_fields parameter.

Changed in version 3.9.2: Added separator parameter with the default value of
`&`. Python versions earlier than Python 3.9.2 allowed using both `;` and `&`
as query parameter separator. This has been changed to allow only a single
separator key, with `&` as the default separator.

`urllib.parse.urlunparse(parts)`

    
Construct a URL from a tuple as returned by `urlparse()`. The parts argument
can be any six-item iterable. This may result in a slightly different, but
equivalent URL, if the URL that was parsed originally had unnecessary
delimiters (for example, a `?` with an empty query; the RFC states that these
are equivalent).

`urllib.parse.urlsplit(urlstring, scheme='', allow_fragments=True)`

    
This is similar to `urlparse()`, but does not split the params from the URL.
This should generally be used instead of `urlparse()` if the more recent URL
syntax allowing parameters to be applied to each segment of the path portion
of the URL (see RFC 2396) is wanted. A separate function is needed to separate
the path segments and parameters. This function returns a 5-item named tuple:

    
    (addressing scheme, network location, path, query, fragment identifier).
    
The return value is a named tuple, its items can be accessed by index or as
named attributes:

Attribute | Index | Value | Value if not present  
---|---|---|---  
`scheme` | 0 | URL scheme specifier | scheme parameter  
`netloc` | 1 | Network location part | empty string  
`path` | 2 | Hierarchical path | empty string  
`query` | 3 | Query component | empty string  
`fragment` | 4 | Fragment identifier | empty string  
`username` |  | User name | `None`  
`password` |  | Password | `None`  
`hostname` |  | Host name (lower case) | `None`  
`port` |  | Port number as integer, if present | `None`  
Reading the `port` attribute will raise a `ValueError` if an invalid port is
specified in the URL. See section Structured Parse Results for more
information on the result object.

Unmatched square brackets in the `netloc` attribute will raise a `ValueError`.

Characters in the `netloc` attribute that decompose under NFKC normalization
(as used by the IDNA encoding) into any of `/`, `?`, `#`, `@`, or `:` will
raise a `ValueError`. If the URL is decomposed before parsing, no error will
be raised.

Changed in version 3.6: Out-of-range port numbers now raise `ValueError`,
instead of returning `None`.

Changed in version 3.8: Characters that affect netloc parsing under NFKC
normalization will now raise `ValueError`.

`urllib.parse.urlunsplit(parts)`

    
Combine the elements of a tuple as returned by `urlsplit()` into a complete
URL as a string. The parts argument can be any five-item iterable. This may
result in a slightly different, but equivalent URL, if the URL that was parsed
originally had unnecessary delimiters (for example, a ? with an empty query;
the RFC states that these are equivalent).

`urllib.parse.urljoin(base, url, allow_fragments=True)`

    
Construct a full (“absolute”) URL by combining a “base URL” (base) with
another URL (url). Informally, this uses components of the base URL, in
particular the addressing scheme, the network location and (part of) the path,
to provide missing components in the relative URL. For example:

    
    >>> from urllib.parse import urljoin
    >>> urljoin('http://www.cwi.nl/%7Eguido/Python.html', 'FAQ.html')
    'http://www.cwi.nl/%7Eguido/FAQ.html'
    
The allow_fragments argument has the same meaning and default as for
`urlparse()`.

Note

If url is an absolute URL (that is, it starts with `//` or `scheme://`), the
url’s hostname and/or scheme will be present in the result. For example:

    
    >>> urljoin('http://www.cwi.nl/%7Eguido/Python.html',
    ...         '//www.python.org/%7Eguido')
    'http://www.python.org/%7Eguido'
    
If you do not want that behavior, preprocess the url with `urlsplit()` and
`urlunsplit()`, removing possible scheme and netloc parts.

Changed in version 3.5: Behavior updated to match the semantics defined in RFC
3986.

`urllib.parse.urldefrag(url)`

    
If url contains a fragment identifier, return a modified version of url with
no fragment identifier, and the fragment identifier as a separate string. If
there is no fragment identifier in url, return url unmodified and an empty
string.

The return value is a named tuple, its items can be accessed by index or as
named attributes:

Attribute | Index | Value | Value if not present  
---|---|---|---  
`url` | 0 | URL with no fragment | empty string  
`fragment` | 1 | Fragment identifier | empty string  
See section Structured Parse Results for more information on the result
object.

Changed in version 3.2: Result is a structured object rather than a simple
2-tuple.

`urllib.parse.unwrap(url)`

    
Extract the url from a wrapped URL (that is, a string formatted as
`<URL:scheme://host/path>`, `<scheme://host/path>`, `URL:scheme://host/path`
or `scheme://host/path`). If url is not a wrapped URL, it is returned without
changes.

## Parsing ASCII Encoded Bytes

The URL parsing functions were originally designed to operate on character
strings only. In practice, it is useful to be able to manipulate properly
quoted and encoded URLs as sequences of ASCII bytes. Accordingly, the URL
parsing functions in this module all operate on `bytes` and `bytearray`
objects in addition to `str` objects.

If `str` data is passed in, the result will also contain only `str` data. If
`bytes` or `bytearray` data is passed in, the result will contain only `bytes`
data.

Attempting to mix `str` data with `bytes` or `bytearray` in a single function
call will result in a `TypeError` being raised, while attempting to pass in
non-ASCII byte values will trigger `UnicodeDecodeError`.

To support easier conversion of result objects between `str` and `bytes`, all
return values from URL parsing functions provide either an `encode()` method
(when the result contains `str` data) or a `decode()` method (when the result
contains `bytes` data). The signatures of these methods match those of the
corresponding `str` and `bytes` methods (except that the default encoding is
`'ascii'` rather than `'utf-8'`). Each produces a value of a corresponding
type that contains either `bytes` data (for `encode()` methods) or `str` data
(for `decode()` methods).

Applications that need to operate on potentially improperly quoted URLs that
may contain non-ASCII data will need to do their own decoding from bytes to
characters before invoking the URL parsing methods.

The behaviour described in this section applies only to the URL parsing
functions. The URL quoting functions use their own rules when producing or
consuming byte sequences as detailed in the documentation of the individual
URL quoting functions.

Changed in version 3.2: URL parsing functions now accept ASCII encoded byte
sequences

## Structured Parse Results

The result objects from the `urlparse()`, `urlsplit()` and `urldefrag()`
functions are subclasses of the `tuple` type. These subclasses add the
attributes listed in the documentation for those functions, the encoding and
decoding support described in the previous section, as well as an additional
method:

`urllib.parse.SplitResult.geturl()`

    
Return the re-combined version of the original URL as a string. This may
differ from the original URL in that the scheme may be normalized to lower
case and empty components may be dropped. Specifically, empty parameters,
queries, and fragment identifiers will be removed.

For `urldefrag()` results, only empty fragment identifiers will be removed.
For `urlsplit()` and `urlparse()` results, all noted changes will be made to
the URL returned by this method.

The result of this method remains unchanged if passed back through the
original parsing function:

    
    >>> from urllib.parse import urlsplit
    >>> url = 'HTTP://www.Python.org/doc/#'
    >>> r1 = urlsplit(url)
    >>> r1.geturl()
    'http://www.Python.org/doc/'
    >>> r2 = urlsplit(r1.geturl())
    >>> r2.geturl()
    'http://www.Python.org/doc/'
    
The following classes provide the implementations of the structured parse
results when operating on `str` objects:

`class urllib.parse.DefragResult(url, fragment)`

    
Concrete class for `urldefrag()` results containing `str` data. The `encode()`
method returns a `DefragResultBytes` instance.

New in version 3.2.

`class urllib.parse.ParseResult(scheme, netloc, path, params, query,
fragment)`

    
Concrete class for `urlparse()` results containing `str` data. The `encode()`
method returns a `ParseResultBytes` instance.

`class urllib.parse.SplitResult(scheme, netloc, path, query, fragment)`

    
Concrete class for `urlsplit()` results containing `str` data. The `encode()`
method returns a `SplitResultBytes` instance.

The following classes provide the implementations of the parse results when
operating on `bytes` or `bytearray` objects:

`class urllib.parse.DefragResultBytes(url, fragment)`

    
Concrete class for `urldefrag()` results containing `bytes` data. The
`decode()` method returns a `DefragResult` instance.

New in version 3.2.

`class urllib.parse.ParseResultBytes(scheme, netloc, path, params, query,
fragment)`

    
Concrete class for `urlparse()` results containing `bytes` data. The
`decode()` method returns a `ParseResult` instance.

New in version 3.2.

`class urllib.parse.SplitResultBytes(scheme, netloc, path, query, fragment)`

    
Concrete class for `urlsplit()` results containing `bytes` data. The
`decode()` method returns a `SplitResult` instance.

New in version 3.2.

## URL Quoting

The URL quoting functions focus on taking program data and making it safe for
use as URL components by quoting special characters and appropriately encoding
non-ASCII text. They also support reversing these operations to recreate the
original data from the contents of a URL component if that task isn’t already
covered by the URL parsing functions above.

`urllib.parse.quote(string, safe='/', encoding=None, errors=None)`

    
Replace special characters in string using the `%xx` escape. Letters, digits,
and the characters `'_.-~'` are never quoted. By default, this function is
intended for quoting the path section of a URL. The optional safe parameter
specifies additional ASCII characters that should not be quoted — its default
value is `'/'`.

string may be either a `str` or a `bytes` object.

Changed in version 3.7: Moved from RFC 2396 to RFC 3986 for quoting URL
strings. “~” is now included in the set of unreserved characters.

The optional encoding and errors parameters specify how to deal with non-ASCII
characters, as accepted by the `str.encode()` method. encoding defaults to
`'utf-8'`. errors defaults to `'strict'`, meaning unsupported characters raise
a `UnicodeEncodeError`. encoding and errors must not be supplied if string is
a `bytes`, or a `TypeError` is raised.

Note that `quote(string, safe, encoding, errors)` is equivalent to
`quote_from_bytes(string.encode(encoding, errors), safe)`.

Example: `quote('/El Niño/')` yields `'/El%20Ni%C3%B1o/'`.

`urllib.parse.quote_plus(string, safe='', encoding=None, errors=None)`

    
Like `quote()`, but also replace spaces with plus signs, as required for
quoting HTML form values when building up a query string to go into a URL.
Plus signs in the original string are escaped unless they are included in
safe. It also does not have safe default to `'/'`.

Example: `quote_plus('/El Niño/')` yields `'%2FEl+Ni%C3%B1o%2F'`.

`urllib.parse.quote_from_bytes(bytes, safe='/')`

    
Like `quote()`, but accepts a `bytes` object rather than a `str`, and does not
perform string-to-bytes encoding.

Example: `quote_from_bytes(b'a&\xef')` yields `'a%26%EF'`.

`urllib.parse.unquote(string, encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')`

    
Replace `%xx` escapes with their single-character equivalent. The optional
encoding and errors parameters specify how to decode percent-encoded sequences
into Unicode characters, as accepted by the `bytes.decode()` method.

string may be either a `str` or a `bytes` object.

encoding defaults to `'utf-8'`. errors defaults to `'replace'`, meaning
invalid sequences are replaced by a placeholder character.

Example: `unquote('/El%20Ni%C3%B1o/')` yields `'/El Niño/'`.

Changed in version 3.9: string parameter supports bytes and str objects
(previously only str).

`urllib.parse.unquote_plus(string, encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')`

    
Like `unquote()`, but also replace plus signs with spaces, as required for
unquoting HTML form values.

string must be a `str`.

Example: `unquote_plus('/El+Ni%C3%B1o/')` yields `'/El Niño/'`.

`urllib.parse.unquote_to_bytes(string)`

    
Replace `%xx` escapes with their single-octet equivalent, and return a `bytes`
object.

string may be either a `str` or a `bytes` object.

If it is a `str`, unescaped non-ASCII characters in string are encoded into
UTF-8 bytes.

Example: `unquote_to_bytes('a%26%EF')` yields `b'a&\xef'`.

`urllib.parse.urlencode(query, doseq=False, safe='', encoding=None,
errors=None, quote_via=quote_plus)`

    
Convert a mapping object or a sequence of two-element tuples, which may
contain `str` or `bytes` objects, to a percent-encoded ASCII text string. If
the resultant string is to be used as a data for POST operation with the
`urlopen()` function, then it should be encoded to bytes, otherwise it would
result in a `TypeError`.

The resulting string is a series of `key=value` pairs separated by `'&'`
characters, where both key and value are quoted using the quote_via function.
By default, `quote_plus()` is used to quote the values, which means spaces are
quoted as a `'+'` character and ‘/’ characters are encoded as `%2F`, which
follows the standard for GET requests (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).
An alternate function that can be passed as quote_via is `quote()`, which will
encode spaces as `%20` and not encode ‘/’ characters. For maximum control of
what is quoted, use `quote` and specify a value for safe.

When a sequence of two-element tuples is used as the query argument, the first
element of each tuple is a key and the second is a value. The value element in
itself can be a sequence and in that case, if the optional parameter doseq
evaluates to `True`, individual `key=value` pairs separated by `'&'` are
generated for each element of the value sequence for the key. The order of
parameters in the encoded string will match the order of parameter tuples in
the sequence.

The safe, encoding, and errors parameters are passed down to quote_via (the
encoding and errors parameters are only passed when a query element is a
`str`).

To reverse this encoding process, `parse_qs()` and `parse_qsl()` are provided
in this module to parse query strings into Python data structures.

Refer to urllib examples to find out how the `urllib.parse.urlencode()` method
can be used for generating the query string of a URL or data for a POST
request.

Changed in version 3.2: query supports bytes and string objects.

New in version 3.5: quote_via parameter.
