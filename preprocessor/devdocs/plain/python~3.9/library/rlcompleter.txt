# rlcompleter — Completion function for GNU readline

Source code: Lib/rlcompleter.py

The `rlcompleter` module defines a completion function suitable for the
`readline` module by completing valid Python identifiers and keywords.

When this module is imported on a Unix platform with the `readline` module
available, an instance of the `Completer` class is automatically created and
its `complete()` method is set as the `readline` completer.

Example:

    
    >>> import rlcompleter
    >>> import readline
    >>> readline.parse_and_bind("tab: complete")
    >>> readline. <TAB PRESSED>
    readline.__doc__          readline.get_line_buffer(  readline.read_init_file(
    readline.__file__         readline.insert_text(      readline.set_completer(
    readline.__name__         readline.parse_and_bind(
    >>> readline.
    
The `rlcompleter` module is designed for use with Python’s interactive mode.
Unless Python is run with the `-S` option, the module is automatically
imported and configured (see Readline configuration).

On platforms without `readline`, the `Completer` class defined by this module
can still be used for custom purposes.

## Completer Objects

Completer objects have the following method:

`Completer.complete(text, state)`

    
Return the stateth completion for text.

If called for text that doesn’t include a period character (`'.'`), it will
complete from names currently defined in `__main__`, `builtins` and keywords
(as defined by the `keyword` module).

If called for a dotted name, it will try to evaluate anything without obvious
side-effects (functions will not be evaluated, but it can generate calls to
`__getattr__()`) up to the last part, and find matches for the rest via the
`dir()` function. Any exception raised during the evaluation of the expression
is caught, silenced and `None` is returned.
