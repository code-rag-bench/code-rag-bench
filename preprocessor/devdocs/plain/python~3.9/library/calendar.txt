# calendar — General calendar-related functions

Source code: Lib/calendar.py

This module allows you to output calendars like the Unix cal program, and
provides additional useful functions related to the calendar. By default,
these calendars have Monday as the first day of the week, and Sunday as the
last (the European convention). Use `setfirstweekday()` to set the first day
of the week to Sunday (6) or to any other weekday. Parameters that specify
dates are given as integers. For related functionality, see also the
`datetime` and `time` modules.

The functions and classes defined in this module use an idealized calendar,
the current Gregorian calendar extended indefinitely in both directions. This
matches the definition of the “proleptic Gregorian” calendar in Dershowitz and
Reingold’s book “Calendrical Calculations”, where it’s the base calendar for
all computations. Zero and negative years are interpreted as prescribed by the
ISO 8601 standard. Year 0 is 1 BC, year -1 is 2 BC, and so on.

`class calendar.Calendar(firstweekday=0)`

    
Creates a `Calendar` object. firstweekday is an integer specifying the first
day of the week. `0` is Monday (the default), `6` is Sunday.

A `Calendar` object provides several methods that can be used for preparing
the calendar data for formatting. This class doesn’t do any formatting itself.
This is the job of subclasses.

`Calendar` instances have the following methods:

`iterweekdays()`

    
Return an iterator for the week day numbers that will be used for one week.
The first value from the iterator will be the same as the value of the
`firstweekday` property.

`itermonthdates(year, month)`

    
Return an iterator for the month month (1–12) in the year year. This iterator
will return all days (as `datetime.date` objects) for the month and all days
before the start of the month or after the end of the month that are required
to get a complete week.

`itermonthdays(year, month)`

    
Return an iterator for the month month in the year year similar to
`itermonthdates()`, but not restricted by the `datetime.date` range. Days
returned will simply be day of the month numbers. For the days outside of the
specified month, the day number is `0`.

`itermonthdays2(year, month)`

    
Return an iterator for the month month in the year year similar to
`itermonthdates()`, but not restricted by the `datetime.date` range. Days
returned will be tuples consisting of a day of the month number and a week day
number.

`itermonthdays3(year, month)`

    
Return an iterator for the month month in the year year similar to
`itermonthdates()`, but not restricted by the `datetime.date` range. Days
returned will be tuples consisting of a year, a month and a day of the month
numbers.

New in version 3.7.

`itermonthdays4(year, month)`

    
Return an iterator for the month month in the year year similar to
`itermonthdates()`, but not restricted by the `datetime.date` range. Days
returned will be tuples consisting of a year, a month, a day of the month, and
a day of the week numbers.

New in version 3.7.

`monthdatescalendar(year, month)`

    
Return a list of the weeks in the month month of the year as full weeks. Weeks
are lists of seven `datetime.date` objects.

`monthdays2calendar(year, month)`

    
Return a list of the weeks in the month month of the year as full weeks. Weeks
are lists of seven tuples of day numbers and weekday numbers.

`monthdayscalendar(year, month)`

    
Return a list of the weeks in the month month of the year as full weeks. Weeks
are lists of seven day numbers.

`yeardatescalendar(year, width=3)`

    
Return the data for the specified year ready for formatting. The return value
is a list of month rows. Each month row contains up to width months
(defaulting to 3). Each month contains between 4 and 6 weeks and each week
contains 1–7 days. Days are `datetime.date` objects.

`yeardays2calendar(year, width=3)`

    
Return the data for the specified year ready for formatting (similar to
`yeardatescalendar()`). Entries in the week lists are tuples of day numbers
and weekday numbers. Day numbers outside this month are zero.

`yeardayscalendar(year, width=3)`

    
Return the data for the specified year ready for formatting (similar to
`yeardatescalendar()`). Entries in the week lists are day numbers. Day numbers
outside this month are zero.

`class calendar.TextCalendar(firstweekday=0)`

    
This class can be used to generate plain text calendars.

`TextCalendar` instances have the following methods:

`formatmonth(theyear, themonth, w=0, l=0)`

    
Return a month’s calendar in a multi-line string. If w is provided, it
specifies the width of the date columns, which are centered. If l is given, it
specifies the number of lines that each week will use. Depends on the first
weekday as specified in the constructor or set by the `setfirstweekday()`
method.

`prmonth(theyear, themonth, w=0, l=0)`

    
Print a month’s calendar as returned by `formatmonth()`.

`formatyear(theyear, w=2, l=1, c=6, m=3)`

    
Return a m-column calendar for an entire year as a multi-line string. Optional
parameters w, l, and c are for date column width, lines per week, and number
of spaces between month columns, respectively. Depends on the first weekday as
specified in the constructor or set by the `setfirstweekday()` method. The
earliest year for which a calendar can be generated is platform-dependent.

`pryear(theyear, w=2, l=1, c=6, m=3)`

    
Print the calendar for an entire year as returned by `formatyear()`.

`class calendar.HTMLCalendar(firstweekday=0)`

    
This class can be used to generate HTML calendars.

`HTMLCalendar` instances have the following methods:

`formatmonth(theyear, themonth, withyear=True)`

    
Return a month’s calendar as an HTML table. If withyear is true the year will
be included in the header, otherwise just the month name will be used.

`formatyear(theyear, width=3)`

    
Return a year’s calendar as an HTML table. width (defaulting to 3) specifies
the number of months per row.

`formatyearpage(theyear, width=3, css='calendar.css', encoding=None)`

    
Return a year’s calendar as a complete HTML page. width (defaulting to 3)
specifies the number of months per row. css is the name for the cascading
style sheet to be used. `None` can be passed if no style sheet should be used.
encoding specifies the encoding to be used for the output (defaulting to the
system default encoding).

`HTMLCalendar` has the following attributes you can override to customize the
CSS classes used by the calendar:

`cssclasses`

    
A list of CSS classes used for each weekday. The default class list is:

    
    cssclasses = ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun"]
    
more styles can be added for each day:

    
    cssclasses = ["mon text-bold", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun red"]
    
Note that the length of this list must be seven items.

`cssclass_noday`

    
The CSS class for a weekday occurring in the previous or coming month.

New in version 3.7.

`cssclasses_weekday_head`

    
A list of CSS classes used for weekday names in the header row. The default is
the same as `cssclasses`.

New in version 3.7.

`cssclass_month_head`

    
The month’s head CSS class (used by `formatmonthname()`). The default value is
`"month"`.

New in version 3.7.

`cssclass_month`

    
The CSS class for the whole month’s table (used by `formatmonth()`). The
default value is `"month"`.

New in version 3.7.

`cssclass_year`

    
The CSS class for the whole year’s table of tables (used by `formatyear()`).
The default value is `"year"`.

New in version 3.7.

`cssclass_year_head`

    
The CSS class for the table head for the whole year (used by `formatyear()`).
The default value is `"year"`.

New in version 3.7.

Note that although the naming for the above described class attributes is
singular (e.g. `cssclass_month` `cssclass_noday`), one can replace the single
CSS class with a space separated list of CSS classes, for example:

    
    "text-bold text-red"
    
Here is an example how `HTMLCalendar` can be customized:

    
    class CustomHTMLCal(calendar.HTMLCalendar):
        cssclasses = [style + " text-nowrap" for style in
                      calendar.HTMLCalendar.cssclasses]
        cssclass_month_head = "text-center month-head"
        cssclass_month = "text-center month"
        cssclass_year = "text-italic lead"
    
`class calendar.LocaleTextCalendar(firstweekday=0, locale=None)`

    
This subclass of `TextCalendar` can be passed a locale name in the constructor
and will return month and weekday names in the specified locale. If this
locale includes an encoding all strings containing month and weekday names
will be returned as unicode.

`class calendar.LocaleHTMLCalendar(firstweekday=0, locale=None)`

    
This subclass of `HTMLCalendar` can be passed a locale name in the constructor
and will return month and weekday names in the specified locale. If this
locale includes an encoding all strings containing month and weekday names
will be returned as unicode.

Note

The `formatweekday()` and `formatmonthname()` methods of these two classes
temporarily change the current locale to the given locale. Because the current
locale is a process-wide setting, they are not thread-safe.

For simple text calendars this module provides the following functions.

`calendar.setfirstweekday(weekday)`

    
Sets the weekday (`0` is Monday, `6` is Sunday) to start each week. The values
`MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`, `SATURDAY`, and
`SUNDAY` are provided for convenience. For example, to set the first weekday
to Sunday:

    
    import calendar
    calendar.setfirstweekday(calendar.SUNDAY)
    
`calendar.firstweekday()`

    
Returns the current setting for the weekday to start each week.

`calendar.isleap(year)`

    
Returns `True` if year is a leap year, otherwise `False`.

`calendar.leapdays(y1, y2)`

    
Returns the number of leap years in the range from y1 to y2 (exclusive), where
y1 and y2 are years.

This function works for ranges spanning a century change.

`calendar.weekday(year, month, day)`

    
Returns the day of the week (`0` is Monday) for year (`1970`–…), month
(`1`–`12`), day (`1`–`31`).

`calendar.weekheader(n)`

    
Return a header containing abbreviated weekday names. n specifies the width in
characters for one weekday.

`calendar.monthrange(year, month)`

    
Returns weekday of first day of the month and number of days in month, for the
specified year and month.

`calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)`

    
Returns a matrix representing a month’s calendar. Each row represents a week;
days outside of the month are represented by zeros. Each week begins with
Monday unless set by `setfirstweekday()`.

`calendar.prmonth(theyear, themonth, w=0, l=0)`

    
Prints a month’s calendar as returned by `month()`.

`calendar.month(theyear, themonth, w=0, l=0)`

    
Returns a month’s calendar in a multi-line string using the `formatmonth()` of
the `TextCalendar` class.

`calendar.prcal(year, w=0, l=0, c=6, m=3)`

    
Prints the calendar for an entire year as returned by `calendar()`.

`calendar.calendar(year, w=2, l=1, c=6, m=3)`

    
Returns a 3-column calendar for an entire year as a multi-line string using
the `formatyear()` of the `TextCalendar` class.

`calendar.timegm(tuple)`

    
An unrelated but handy function that takes a time tuple such as returned by
the `gmtime()` function in the `time` module, and returns the corresponding
Unix timestamp value, assuming an epoch of 1970, and the POSIX encoding. In
fact, `time.gmtime()` and `timegm()` are each others’ inverse.

The `calendar` module exports the following data attributes:

`calendar.day_name`

    
An array that represents the days of the week in the current locale.

`calendar.day_abbr`

    
An array that represents the abbreviated days of the week in the current
locale.

`calendar.month_name`

    
An array that represents the months of the year in the current locale. This
follows normal convention of January being month number 1, so it has a length
of 13 and `month_name[0]` is the empty string.

`calendar.month_abbr`

    
An array that represents the abbreviated months of the year in the current
locale. This follows normal convention of January being month number 1, so it
has a length of 13 and `month_abbr[0]` is the empty string.
