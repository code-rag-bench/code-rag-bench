# tabnanny — Detection of ambiguous indentation

Source code: Lib/tabnanny.py

For the time being this module is intended to be called as a script. However
it is possible to import it into an IDE and use the function `check()`
described below.

Note

The API provided by this module is likely to change in future releases; such
changes may not be backward compatible.

`tabnanny.check(file_or_dir)`

    
If file_or_dir is a directory and not a symbolic link, then recursively
descend the directory tree named by file_or_dir, checking all `.py` files
along the way. If file_or_dir is an ordinary Python source file, it is checked
for whitespace related problems. The diagnostic messages are written to
standard output using the `print()` function.

`tabnanny.verbose`

    
Flag indicating whether to print verbose messages. This is incremented by the
`-v` option if called as a script.

`tabnanny.filename_only`

    
Flag indicating whether to print only the filenames of files containing
whitespace related problems. This is set to true by the `-q` option if called
as a script.

`exception tabnanny.NannyNag`

    
Raised by `process_tokens()` if detecting an ambiguous indent. Captured and
handled in `check()`.

`tabnanny.process_tokens(tokens)`

    
This function is used by `check()` to process tokens generated by the
`tokenize` module.
