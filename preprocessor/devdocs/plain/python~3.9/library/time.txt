# time — Time access and conversions

This module provides various time-related functions. For related
functionality, see also the `datetime` and `calendar` modules.

Although this module is always available, not all functions are available on
all platforms. Most of the functions defined in this module call platform C
library functions with the same name. It may sometimes be helpful to consult
the platform documentation, because the semantics of these functions varies
among platforms.

An explanation of some terminology and conventions is in order.

  * The epoch is the point where the time starts, and is platform dependent. For Unix, the epoch is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC). To find out what the epoch is on a given platform, look at `time.gmtime(0)`.

  * The term seconds since the epoch refers to the total number of elapsed seconds since the epoch, typically excluding leap seconds. Leap seconds are excluded from this total on all POSIX-compliant platforms.

  * The functions in this module may not handle dates and times before the epoch or far in the future. The cut-off point in the future is determined by the C library; for 32-bit systems, it is typically in 2038.

  * Function `strptime()` can parse 2-digit years when given `%y` format code. When 2-digit years are parsed, they are converted according to the POSIX and ISO C standards: values 69–99 are mapped to 1969–1999, and values 0–68 are mapped to 2000–2068.

  * UTC is Coordinated Universal Time (formerly known as Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT). The acronym UTC is not a mistake but a compromise between English and French.

  * DST is Daylight Saving Time, an adjustment of the timezone by (usually) one hour during part of the year. DST rules are magic (determined by local law) and can change from year to year. The C library has a table containing the local rules (often it is read from a system file for flexibility) and is the only source of True Wisdom in this respect.
  * The precision of the various real-time functions may be less than suggested by the units in which their value or argument is expressed. E.g. on most Unix systems, the clock “ticks” only 50 or 100 times a second.
  * On the other hand, the precision of `time()` and `sleep()` is better than their Unix equivalents: times are expressed as floating point numbers, `time()` returns the most accurate time available (using Unix `gettimeofday()` where available), and `sleep()` will accept a time with a nonzero fraction (Unix `select()` is used to implement this, where available).
  * The time value as returned by `gmtime()`, `localtime()`, and `strptime()`, and accepted by `asctime()`, `mktime()` and `strftime()`, is a sequence of 9 integers. The return values of `gmtime()`, `localtime()`, and `strptime()` also offer attribute names for individual fields.
See `struct_time` for a description of these objects.

Changed in version 3.3: The `struct_time` type was extended to provide the
`tm_gmtoff` and `tm_zone` attributes when platform supports corresponding
`struct tm` members.

Changed in version 3.6: The `struct_time` attributes `tm_gmtoff` and `tm_zone`
are now available on all platforms.

  * Use the following functions to convert between time representations:
From | To | Use  
---|---|---  
seconds since the epoch | `struct_time` in UTC | `gmtime()`  
seconds since the epoch | `struct_time` in local time | `localtime()`  
`struct_time` in UTC | seconds since the epoch | `calendar.timegm()`  
`struct_time` in local time | seconds since the epoch | `mktime()`  

## Functions

`time.asctime([t])`

    
Convert a tuple or `struct_time` representing a time as returned by `gmtime()`
or `localtime()` to a string of the following form: `'Sun Jun 20 23:21:05
1993'`. The day field is two characters long and is space padded if the day is
a single digit, e.g.: `'Wed Jun 9 04:26:40 1993'`.

If t is not provided, the current time as returned by `localtime()` is used.
Locale information is not used by `asctime()`.

Note

Unlike the C function of the same name, `asctime()` does not add a trailing
newline.

`time.pthread_getcpuclockid(thread_id)`

    
Return the clk_id of the thread-specific CPU-time clock for the specified
thread_id.

Use `threading.get_ident()` or the `ident` attribute of `threading.Thread`
objects to get a suitable value for thread_id.

Warning

Passing an invalid or expired thread_id may result in undefined behavior, such
as segmentation fault.

Availability: Unix (see the man page for pthread_getcpuclockid(3) for further
information).

New in version 3.7.

`time.clock_getres(clk_id)`

    
Return the resolution (precision) of the specified clock clk_id. Refer to
Clock ID Constants for a list of accepted values for clk_id.

Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.

`time.clock_gettime(clk_id) → float`

    
Return the time of the specified clock clk_id. Refer to Clock ID Constants for
a list of accepted values for clk_id.

Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.

`time.clock_gettime_ns(clk_id) → int`

    
Similar to `clock_gettime()` but return time as nanoseconds.

Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.7.

`time.clock_settime(clk_id, time: float)`

    
Set the time of the specified clock clk_id. Currently, `CLOCK_REALTIME` is the
only accepted value for clk_id.

Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.

`time.clock_settime_ns(clk_id, time: int)`

    
Similar to `clock_settime()` but set time with nanoseconds.

Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.7.

`time.ctime([secs])`

    
Convert a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a string of a form:
`'Sun Jun 20 23:21:05 1993'` representing local time. The day field is two
characters long and is space padded if the day is a single digit, e.g.: `'Wed
Jun 9 04:26:40 1993'`.

If secs is not provided or `None`, the current time as returned by `time()` is
used. `ctime(secs)` is equivalent to `asctime(localtime(secs))`. Locale
information is not used by `ctime()`.

`time.get_clock_info(name)`

    
Get information on the specified clock as a namespace object. Supported clock
names and the corresponding functions to read their value are:

  * `'monotonic'`: `time.monotonic()`
  * `'perf_counter'`: `time.perf_counter()`
  * `'process_time'`: `time.process_time()`
  * `'thread_time'`: `time.thread_time()`
  * `'time'`: `time.time()`

The result has the following attributes:

  * adjustable: `True` if the clock can be changed automatically (e.g. by a NTP daemon) or manually by the system administrator, `False` otherwise
  * implementation: The name of the underlying C function used to get the clock value. Refer to Clock ID Constants for possible values.
  * monotonic: `True` if the clock cannot go backward, `False` otherwise
  * resolution: The resolution of the clock in seconds (`float`)

New in version 3.3.

`time.gmtime([secs])`

    
Convert a time expressed in seconds since the epoch to a `struct_time` in UTC
in which the dst flag is always zero. If secs is not provided or `None`, the
current time as returned by `time()` is used. Fractions of a second are
ignored. See above for a description of the `struct_time` object. See
`calendar.timegm()` for the inverse of this function.

`time.localtime([secs])`

    
Like `gmtime()` but converts to local time. If secs is not provided or `None`,
the current time as returned by `time()` is used. The dst flag is set to `1`
when DST applies to the given time.

`time.mktime(t)`

    
This is the inverse function of `localtime()`. Its argument is the
`struct_time` or full 9-tuple (since the dst flag is needed; use `-1` as the
dst flag if it is unknown) which expresses the time in local time, not UTC. It
returns a floating point number, for compatibility with `time()`. If the input
value cannot be represented as a valid time, either `OverflowError` or
`ValueError` will be raised (which depends on whether the invalid value is
caught by Python or the underlying C libraries). The earliest date for which
it can generate a time is platform-dependent.

`time.monotonic() → float`

    
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a monotonic clock, i.e. a clock
that cannot go backwards. The clock is not affected by system clock updates.
The reference point of the returned value is undefined, so that only the
difference between the results of two calls is valid.

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.5: The function is now always available and always
system-wide.

`time.monotonic_ns() → int`

    
Similar to `monotonic()`, but return time as nanoseconds.

New in version 3.7.

`time.perf_counter() → float`

    
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of a performance counter, i.e. a
clock with the highest available resolution to measure a short duration. It
does include time elapsed during sleep and is system-wide. The reference point
of the returned value is undefined, so that only the difference between the
results of two calls is valid.

New in version 3.3.

`time.perf_counter_ns() → int`

    
Similar to `perf_counter()`, but return time as nanoseconds.

New in version 3.7.

`time.process_time() → float`

    
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and user CPU
time of the current process. It does not include time elapsed during sleep. It
is process-wide by definition. The reference point of the returned value is
undefined, so that only the difference between the results of two calls is
valid.

New in version 3.3.

`time.process_time_ns() → int`

    
Similar to `process_time()` but return time as nanoseconds.

New in version 3.7.

`time.sleep(secs)`

    
Suspend execution of the calling thread for the given number of seconds. The
argument may be a floating point number to indicate a more precise sleep time.
The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any caught
signal will terminate the `sleep()` following execution of that signal’s
catching routine. Also, the suspension time may be longer than requested by an
arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity in the system.

Changed in version 3.5: The function now sleeps at least secs even if the
sleep is interrupted by a signal, except if the signal handler raises an
exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale).

`time.strftime(format[, t])`

    
Convert a tuple or `struct_time` representing a time as returned by `gmtime()`
or `localtime()` to a string as specified by the format argument. If t is not
provided, the current time as returned by `localtime()` is used. format must
be a string. `ValueError` is raised if any field in t is outside of the
allowed range.

0 is a legal argument for any position in the time tuple; if it is normally
illegal the value is forced to a correct one.

The following directives can be embedded in the format string. They are shown
without the optional field width and precision specification, and are replaced
by the indicated characters in the `strftime()` result:

Directive | Meaning | Notes  
---|---|---  
`%a` | Locale’s abbreviated weekday name. |   
`%A` | Locale’s full weekday name. |   
`%b` | Locale’s abbreviated month name. |   
`%B` | Locale’s full month name. |   
`%c` | Locale’s appropriate date and time representation. |   
`%d` | Day of the month as a decimal number [01,31]. |   
`%H` | Hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number [00,23]. |   
`%I` | Hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12]. |   
`%j` | Day of the year as a decimal number [001,366]. |   
`%m` | Month as a decimal number [01,12]. |   
`%M` | Minute as a decimal number [00,59]. |   
`%p` | Locale’s equivalent of either AM or PM. | (1)  
`%S` | Second as a decimal number [00,61]. | (2)  
`%U` | Week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number [00,53]. All days in a new year preceding the first Sunday are considered to be in week 0. | (3)  
`%w` | Weekday as a decimal number [0(Sunday),6]. |   
`%W` | Week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number [00,53]. All days in a new year preceding the first Monday are considered to be in week 0. | (3)  
`%x` | Locale’s appropriate date representation. |   
`%X` | Locale’s appropriate time representation. |   
`%y` | Year without century as a decimal number [00,99]. |   
`%Y` | Year with century as a decimal number. |   
`%z` | Time zone offset indicating a positive or negative time difference from UTC/GMT of the form +HHMM or -HHMM, where H represents decimal hour digits and M represents decimal minute digits [-23:59, +23:59]. |   
`%Z` | Time zone name (no characters if no time zone exists). |   
`%%` | A literal `'%'` character. |   
Notes:

  1. When used with the `strptime()` function, the `%p` directive only affects the output hour field if the `%I` directive is used to parse the hour.
  2. The range really is `0` to `61`; value `60` is valid in timestamps representing leap seconds and value `61` is supported for historical reasons.
  3. When used with the `strptime()` function, `%U` and `%W` are only used in calculations when the day of the week and the year are specified.

Here is an example, a format for dates compatible with that specified in the
RFC 2822 Internet email standard. 1

    
    >>> from time import gmtime, strftime
    >>> strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000", gmtime())
    'Thu, 28 Jun 2001 14:17:15 +0000'
    
Additional directives may be supported on certain platforms, but only the ones
listed here have a meaning standardized by ANSI C. To see the full set of
format codes supported on your platform, consult the strftime(3)
documentation.

On some platforms, an optional field width and precision specification can
immediately follow the initial `'%'` of a directive in the following order;
this is also not portable. The field width is normally 2 except for `%j` where
it is 3.

`time.strptime(string[, format])`

    
Parse a string representing a time according to a format. The return value is
a `struct_time` as returned by `gmtime()` or `localtime()`.

The format parameter uses the same directives as those used by `strftime()`;
it defaults to `"%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y"` which matches the formatting returned
by `ctime()`. If string cannot be parsed according to format, or if it has
excess data after parsing, `ValueError` is raised. The default values used to
fill in any missing data when more accurate values cannot be inferred are
`(1900, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1)`. Both string and format must be strings.

For example:

    
    >>> import time
    >>> time.strptime("30 Nov 00", "%d %b %y")   
    time.struct_time(tm_year=2000, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=30, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0,
                     tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=335, tm_isdst=-1)
    
Support for the `%Z` directive is based on the values contained in `tzname`
and whether `daylight` is true. Because of this, it is platform-specific
except for recognizing UTC and GMT which are always known (and are considered
to be non-daylight savings timezones).

Only the directives specified in the documentation are supported. Because
`strftime()` is implemented per platform it can sometimes offer more
directives than those listed. But `strptime()` is independent of any platform
and thus does not necessarily support all directives available that are not
documented as supported.

`class time.struct_time`

    
The type of the time value sequence returned by `gmtime()`, `localtime()`, and
`strptime()`. It is an object with a named tuple interface: values can be
accessed by index and by attribute name. The following values are present:

Index | Attribute | Values  
---|---|---  
0 | `tm_year` | (for example, 1993)  
1 | `tm_mon` | range [1, 12]  
2 | `tm_mday` | range [1, 31]  
3 | `tm_hour` | range [0, 23]  
4 | `tm_min` | range [0, 59]  
5 | `tm_sec` | range [0, 61]; see (2) in `strftime()` description  
6 | `tm_wday` | range [0, 6], Monday is 0  
7 | `tm_yday` | range [1, 366]  
8 | `tm_isdst` | 0, 1 or -1; see below  
N/A | `tm_zone` | abbreviation of timezone name  
N/A | `tm_gmtoff` | offset east of UTC in seconds  
Note that unlike the C structure, the month value is a range of [1, 12], not
[0, 11].

In calls to `mktime()`, `tm_isdst` may be set to 1 when daylight savings time
is in effect, and 0 when it is not. A value of -1 indicates that this is not
known, and will usually result in the correct state being filled in.

When a tuple with an incorrect length is passed to a function expecting a
`struct_time`, or having elements of the wrong type, a `TypeError` is raised.

`time.time() → float`

    
Return the time in seconds since the epoch as a floating point number. The
specific date of the epoch and the handling of leap seconds is platform
dependent. On Windows and most Unix systems, the epoch is January 1, 1970,
00:00:00 (UTC) and leap seconds are not counted towards the time in seconds
since the epoch. This is commonly referred to as Unix time. To find out what
the epoch is on a given platform, look at `gmtime(0)`.

Note that even though the time is always returned as a floating point number,
not all systems provide time with a better precision than 1 second. While this
function normally returns non-decreasing values, it can return a lower value
than a previous call if the system clock has been set back between the two
calls.

The number returned by `time()` may be converted into a more common time
format (i.e. year, month, day, hour, etc…) in UTC by passing it to `gmtime()`
function or in local time by passing it to the `localtime()` function. In both
cases a `struct_time` object is returned, from which the components of the
calendar date may be accessed as attributes.

`time.thread_time() → float`

    
Return the value (in fractional seconds) of the sum of the system and user CPU
time of the current thread. It does not include time elapsed during sleep. It
is thread-specific by definition. The reference point of the returned value is
undefined, so that only the difference between the results of two calls in the
same thread is valid.

Availability: Windows, Linux, Unix systems supporting
`CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID`.

New in version 3.7.

`time.thread_time_ns() → int`

    
Similar to `thread_time()` but return time as nanoseconds.

New in version 3.7.

`time.time_ns() → int`

    
Similar to `time()` but returns time as an integer number of nanoseconds since
the epoch.

New in version 3.7.

`time.tzset()`

    
Reset the time conversion rules used by the library routines. The environment
variable `TZ` specifies how this is done. It will also set the variables
`tzname` (from the `TZ` environment variable), `timezone` (non-DST seconds
West of UTC), `altzone` (DST seconds west of UTC) and `daylight` (to 0 if this
timezone does not have any daylight saving time rules, or to nonzero if there
is a time, past, present or future when daylight saving time applies).

Availability: Unix.

Note

Although in many cases, changing the `TZ` environment variable may affect the
output of functions like `localtime()` without calling `tzset()`, this
behavior should not be relied on.

The `TZ` environment variable should contain no whitespace.

The standard format of the `TZ` environment variable is (whitespace added for
clarity):

    
    std offset [dst [offset [,start[/time], end[/time]]]]
    
Where the components are:

`std and dst`

    
Three or more alphanumerics giving the timezone abbreviations. These will be
propagated into time.tzname

`offset`

    
The offset has the form: `± hh[:mm[:ss]]`. This indicates the value added the
local time to arrive at UTC. If preceded by a ‘-‘, the timezone is east of the
Prime Meridian; otherwise, it is west. If no offset follows dst, summer time
is assumed to be one hour ahead of standard time.

`start[/time], end[/time]`

    
Indicates when to change to and back from DST. The format of the start and end
dates are one of the following:

`Jn`

    
The Julian day n (1 <= n <= 365). Leap days are not counted, so in all years
February 28 is day 59 and March 1 is day 60.

`n`

    
The zero-based Julian day (0 <= n <= 365). Leap days are counted, and it is
possible to refer to February 29.

`Mm.n.d`

    
The d’th day (0 <= d <= 6) of week n of month m of the year (1 <= n <= 5, 1 <=
m <= 12, where week 5 means “the last d day in month m” which may occur in
either the fourth or the fifth week). Week 1 is the first week in which the
d’th day occurs. Day zero is a Sunday.

`time` has the same format as `offset` except that no leading sign (‘-‘ or
‘+’) is allowed. The default, if time is not given, is 02:00:00.

    
    >>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'EST+05EDT,M4.1.0,M10.5.0'
    >>> time.tzset()
    >>> time.strftime('%X %x %Z')
    '02:07:36 05/08/03 EDT'
    >>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'AEST-10AEDT-11,M10.5.0,M3.5.0'
    >>> time.tzset()
    >>> time.strftime('%X %x %Z')
    '16:08:12 05/08/03 AEST'
    
On many Unix systems (including *BSD, Linux, Solaris, and Darwin), it is more
convenient to use the system’s zoneinfo (tzfile(5)) database to specify the
timezone rules. To do this, set the `TZ` environment variable to the path of
the required timezone datafile, relative to the root of the systems ‘zoneinfo’
timezone database, usually located at `/usr/share/zoneinfo`. For example,
`'US/Eastern'`, `'Australia/Melbourne'`, `'Egypt'` or `'Europe/Amsterdam'`.

    
    >>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'US/Eastern'
    >>> time.tzset()
    >>> time.tzname
    ('EST', 'EDT')
    >>> os.environ['TZ'] = 'Egypt'
    >>> time.tzset()
    >>> time.tzname
    ('EET', 'EEST')
    
## Clock ID Constants

These constants are used as parameters for `clock_getres()` and
`clock_gettime()`.

`time.CLOCK_BOOTTIME`

    
Identical to `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, except it also includes any time that the
system is suspended.

This allows applications to get a suspend-aware monotonic clock without having
to deal with the complications of `CLOCK_REALTIME`, which may have
discontinuities if the time is changed using `settimeofday()` or similar.

Availability: Linux 2.6.39 or later.

New in version 3.7.

`time.CLOCK_HIGHRES`

    
The Solaris OS has a `CLOCK_HIGHRES` timer that attempts to use an optimal
hardware source, and may give close to nanosecond resolution. `CLOCK_HIGHRES`
is the nonadjustable, high-resolution clock.

Availability: Solaris.

New in version 3.3.

`time.CLOCK_MONOTONIC`

    
Clock that cannot be set and represents monotonic time since some unspecified
starting point.

Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.

`time.CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW`

    
Similar to `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`, but provides access to a raw hardware-based time
that is not subject to NTP adjustments.

Availability: Linux 2.6.28 and newer, macOS 10.12 and newer.

New in version 3.3.

`time.CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID`

    
High-resolution per-process timer from the CPU.

Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.

`time.CLOCK_PROF`

    
High-resolution per-process timer from the CPU.

Availability: FreeBSD, NetBSD 7 or later, OpenBSD.

New in version 3.7.

`time.CLOCK_TAI`

    
International Atomic Time

The system must have a current leap second table in order for this to give the
correct answer. PTP or NTP software can maintain a leap second table.

Availability: Linux.

New in version 3.9.

`time.CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID`

    
Thread-specific CPU-time clock.

Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.

`time.CLOCK_UPTIME`

    
Time whose absolute value is the time the system has been running and not
suspended, providing accurate uptime measurement, both absolute and interval.

Availability: FreeBSD, OpenBSD 5.5 or later.

New in version 3.7.

`time.CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW`

    
Clock that increments monotonically, tracking the time since an arbitrary
point, unaffected by frequency or time adjustments and not incremented while
the system is asleep.

Availability: macOS 10.12 and newer.

New in version 3.8.

The following constant is the only parameter that can be sent to
`clock_settime()`.

`time.CLOCK_REALTIME`

    
System-wide real-time clock. Setting this clock requires appropriate
privileges.

Availability: Unix.

New in version 3.3.

## Timezone Constants

`time.altzone`

    
The offset of the local DST timezone, in seconds west of UTC, if one is
defined. This is negative if the local DST timezone is east of UTC (as in
Western Europe, including the UK). Only use this if `daylight` is nonzero. See
note below.

`time.daylight`

    
Nonzero if a DST timezone is defined. See note below.

`time.timezone`

    
The offset of the local (non-DST) timezone, in seconds west of UTC (negative
in most of Western Europe, positive in the US, zero in the UK). See note
below.

`time.tzname`

    
A tuple of two strings: the first is the name of the local non-DST timezone,
the second is the name of the local DST timezone. If no DST timezone is
defined, the second string should not be used. See note below.

Note

For the above Timezone constants (`altzone`, `daylight`, `timezone`, and
`tzname`), the value is determined by the timezone rules in effect at module
load time or the last time `tzset()` is called and may be incorrect for times
in the past. It is recommended to use the `tm_gmtoff` and `tm_zone` results
from `localtime()` to obtain timezone information.

See also

`Module` `datetime`

    
More object-oriented interface to dates and times.

`Module` `locale`

    
Internationalization services. The locale setting affects the interpretation
of many format specifiers in `strftime()` and `strptime()`.

`Module` `calendar`

    
General calendar-related functions. `timegm()` is the inverse of `gmtime()`
from this module.

#### Footnotes

`1`

    
The use of `%Z` is now deprecated, but the `%z` escape that expands to the
preferred hour/minute offset is not supported by all ANSI C libraries. Also, a
strict reading of the original 1982 RFC 822 standard calls for a two-digit
year (%y rather than %Y), but practice moved to 4-digit years long before the
year 2000. After that, RFC 822 became obsolete and the 4-digit year has been
first recommended by RFC 1123 and then mandated by RFC 2822.
