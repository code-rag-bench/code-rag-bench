# tracemalloc — Trace memory allocations

New in version 3.4.

Source code: Lib/tracemalloc.py

The tracemalloc module is a debug tool to trace memory blocks allocated by
Python. It provides the following information:

  * Traceback where an object was allocated
  * Statistics on allocated memory blocks per filename and per line number: total size, number and average size of allocated memory blocks
  * Compute the differences between two snapshots to detect memory leaks

To trace most memory blocks allocated by Python, the module should be started
as early as possible by setting the `PYTHONTRACEMALLOC` environment variable
to `1`, or by using `-X` `tracemalloc` command line option. The
`tracemalloc.start()` function can be called at runtime to start tracing
Python memory allocations.

By default, a trace of an allocated memory block only stores the most recent
frame (1 frame). To store 25 frames at startup: set the `PYTHONTRACEMALLOC`
environment variable to `25`, or use the `-X` `tracemalloc=25` command line
option.

## Examples

### Display the top 10

Display the 10 files allocating the most memory:

    
    import tracemalloc
    
    tracemalloc.start()
    
    # ... run your application ...
    
    snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
    top_stats = snapshot.statistics('lineno')
    
    print("[ Top 10 ]")
    for stat in top_stats[:10]:
        print(stat)
    
Example of output of the Python test suite:

    
    [ Top 10 ]
    <frozen importlib._bootstrap>:716: size=4855 KiB, count=39328, average=126 B
    <frozen importlib._bootstrap>:284: size=521 KiB, count=3199, average=167 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/collections/__init__.py:368: size=244 KiB, count=2315, average=108 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/case.py:381: size=185 KiB, count=779, average=243 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/case.py:402: size=154 KiB, count=378, average=416 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/abc.py:133: size=88.7 KiB, count=347, average=262 B
    <frozen importlib._bootstrap>:1446: size=70.4 KiB, count=911, average=79 B
    <frozen importlib._bootstrap>:1454: size=52.0 KiB, count=25, average=2131 B
    <string>:5: size=49.7 KiB, count=148, average=344 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/sysconfig.py:411: size=48.0 KiB, count=1, average=48.0 KiB
    
We can see that Python loaded `4855 KiB` data (bytecode and constants) from
modules and that the `collections` module allocated `244 KiB` to build
`namedtuple` types.

See `Snapshot.statistics()` for more options.

### Compute differences

Take two snapshots and display the differences:

    
    import tracemalloc
    tracemalloc.start()
    # ... start your application ...
    
    snapshot1 = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
    # ... call the function leaking memory ...
    snapshot2 = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
    
    top_stats = snapshot2.compare_to(snapshot1, 'lineno')
    
    print("[ Top 10 differences ]")
    for stat in top_stats[:10]:
        print(stat)
    
Example of output before/after running some tests of the Python test suite:

    
    [ Top 10 differences ]
    <frozen importlib._bootstrap>:716: size=8173 KiB (+4428 KiB), count=71332 (+39369), average=117 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/linecache.py:127: size=940 KiB (+940 KiB), count=8106 (+8106), average=119 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/case.py:571: size=298 KiB (+298 KiB), count=589 (+589), average=519 B
    <frozen importlib._bootstrap>:284: size=1005 KiB (+166 KiB), count=7423 (+1526), average=139 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/mimetypes.py:217: size=112 KiB (+112 KiB), count=1334 (+1334), average=86 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/http/server.py:848: size=96.0 KiB (+96.0 KiB), count=1 (+1), average=96.0 KiB
    /usr/lib/python3.4/inspect.py:1465: size=83.5 KiB (+83.5 KiB), count=109 (+109), average=784 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/unittest/mock.py:491: size=77.7 KiB (+77.7 KiB), count=143 (+143), average=557 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/urllib/parse.py:476: size=71.8 KiB (+71.8 KiB), count=969 (+969), average=76 B
    /usr/lib/python3.4/contextlib.py:38: size=67.2 KiB (+67.2 KiB), count=126 (+126), average=546 B
    
We can see that Python has loaded `8173 KiB` of module data (bytecode and
constants), and that this is `4428 KiB` more than had been loaded before the
tests, when the previous snapshot was taken. Similarly, the `linecache` module
has cached `940 KiB` of Python source code to format tracebacks, all of it
since the previous snapshot.

If the system has little free memory, snapshots can be written on disk using
the `Snapshot.dump()` method to analyze the snapshot offline. Then use the
`Snapshot.load()` method reload the snapshot.

### Get the traceback of a memory block

Code to display the traceback of the biggest memory block:

    
    import tracemalloc
    
    # Store 25 frames
    tracemalloc.start(25)
    
    # ... run your application ...
    
    snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
    top_stats = snapshot.statistics('traceback')
    
    # pick the biggest memory block
    stat = top_stats[0]
    print("%s memory blocks: %.1f KiB" % (stat.count, stat.size / 1024))
    for line in stat.traceback.format():
        print(line)
    
Example of output of the Python test suite (traceback limited to 25 frames):

    
    903 memory blocks: 870.1 KiB
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 716
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 1036
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 934
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 1068
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 619
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 1581
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 1614
      File "/usr/lib/python3.4/doctest.py", line 101
        import pdb
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 284
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 938
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 1068
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 619
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 1581
      File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 1614
      File "/usr/lib/python3.4/test/support/__init__.py", line 1728
        import doctest
      File "/usr/lib/python3.4/test/test_pickletools.py", line 21
        support.run_doctest(pickletools)
      File "/usr/lib/python3.4/test/regrtest.py", line 1276
        test_runner()
      File "/usr/lib/python3.4/test/regrtest.py", line 976
        display_failure=not verbose)
      File "/usr/lib/python3.4/test/regrtest.py", line 761
        match_tests=ns.match_tests)
      File "/usr/lib/python3.4/test/regrtest.py", line 1563
        main()
      File "/usr/lib/python3.4/test/__main__.py", line 3
        regrtest.main_in_temp_cwd()
      File "/usr/lib/python3.4/runpy.py", line 73
        exec(code, run_globals)
      File "/usr/lib/python3.4/runpy.py", line 160
        "__main__", fname, loader, pkg_name)
    
We can see that the most memory was allocated in the `importlib` module to
load data (bytecode and constants) from modules: `870.1 KiB`. The traceback is
where the `importlib` loaded data most recently: on the `import pdb` line of
the `doctest` module. The traceback may change if a new module is loaded.

### Pretty top

Code to display the 10 lines allocating the most memory with a pretty output,
ignoring `<frozen importlib._bootstrap>` and `<unknown>` files:

    
    import linecache
    import os
    import tracemalloc
    
    def display_top(snapshot, key_type='lineno', limit=10):
        snapshot = snapshot.filter_traces((
            tracemalloc.Filter(False, "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>"),
            tracemalloc.Filter(False, "<unknown>"),
        ))
        top_stats = snapshot.statistics(key_type)
    
        print("Top %s lines" % limit)
        for index, stat in enumerate(top_stats[:limit], 1):
            frame = stat.traceback[0]
            print("#%s: %s:%s: %.1f KiB"
                  % (index, frame.filename, frame.lineno, stat.size / 1024))
            line = linecache.getline(frame.filename, frame.lineno).strip()
            if line:
                print('    %s' % line)
    
        other = top_stats[limit:]
        if other:
            size = sum(stat.size for stat in other)
            print("%s other: %.1f KiB" % (len(other), size / 1024))
        total = sum(stat.size for stat in top_stats)
        print("Total allocated size: %.1f KiB" % (total / 1024))
    
    tracemalloc.start()
    
    # ... run your application ...
    
    snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
    display_top(snapshot)
    
Example of output of the Python test suite:

#### Record the current and peak size of all traced memory blocks

The following code computes two sums like `0 + 1 + 2 + ...` inefficiently, by
creating a list of those numbers. This list consumes a lot of memory
temporarily. We can use `get_traced_memory()` and `reset_peak()` to observe
the small memory usage after the sum is computed as well as the peak memory
usage during the computations:

    
    import tracemalloc
    
    tracemalloc.start()
    
    # Example code: compute a sum with a large temporary list
    large_sum = sum(list(range(100000)))
    
    first_size, first_peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
    
    tracemalloc.reset_peak()
    
    # Example code: compute a sum with a small temporary list
    small_sum = sum(list(range(1000)))
    
    second_size, second_peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
    
    print(f"{first_size=}, {first_peak=}")
    print(f"{second_size=}, {second_peak=}")
    
Output:

    
    first_size=664, first_peak=3592984
    second_size=804, second_peak=29704
    
Using `reset_peak()` ensured we could accurately record the peak during the
computation of `small_sum`, even though it is much smaller than the overall
peak size of memory blocks since the `start()` call. Without the call to
`reset_peak()`, `second_peak` would still be the peak from the computation
`large_sum` (that is, equal to `first_peak`). In this case, both peaks are
much higher than the final memory usage, and which suggests we could optimise
(by removing the unnecessary call to `list`, and writing `sum(range(...))`).

## API

### Functions

`tracemalloc.clear_traces()`

    
Clear traces of memory blocks allocated by Python.

See also `stop()`.

`tracemalloc.get_object_traceback(obj)`

    
Get the traceback where the Python object obj was allocated. Return a
`Traceback` instance, or `None` if the `tracemalloc` module is not tracing
memory allocations or did not trace the allocation of the object.

See also `gc.get_referrers()` and `sys.getsizeof()` functions.

`tracemalloc.get_traceback_limit()`

    
Get the maximum number of frames stored in the traceback of a trace.

The `tracemalloc` module must be tracing memory allocations to get the limit,
otherwise an exception is raised.

The limit is set by the `start()` function.

`tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()`

    
Get the current size and peak size of memory blocks traced by the
`tracemalloc` module as a tuple: `(current: int, peak: int)`.

`tracemalloc.reset_peak()`

    
Set the peak size of memory blocks traced by the `tracemalloc` module to the
current size.

Do nothing if the `tracemalloc` module is not tracing memory allocations.

This function only modifies the recorded peak size, and does not modify or
clear any traces, unlike `clear_traces()`. Snapshots taken with
`take_snapshot()` before a call to `reset_peak()` can be meaningfully compared
to snapshots taken after the call.

See also `get_traced_memory()`.

New in version 3.9.

`tracemalloc.get_tracemalloc_memory()`

    
Get the memory usage in bytes of the `tracemalloc` module used to store traces
of memory blocks. Return an `int`.

`tracemalloc.is_tracing()`

    
`True` if the `tracemalloc` module is tracing Python memory allocations,
`False` otherwise.

See also `start()` and `stop()` functions.

`tracemalloc.start(nframe: int=1)`

    
Start tracing Python memory allocations: install hooks on Python memory
allocators. Collected tracebacks of traces will be limited to nframe frames.
By default, a trace of a memory block only stores the most recent frame: the
limit is `1`. nframe must be greater or equal to `1`.

You can still read the original number of total frames that composed the
traceback by looking at the `Traceback.total_nframe` attribute.

Storing more than `1` frame is only useful to compute statistics grouped by
`'traceback'` or to compute cumulative statistics: see the
`Snapshot.compare_to()` and `Snapshot.statistics()` methods.

Storing more frames increases the memory and CPU overhead of the `tracemalloc`
module. Use the `get_tracemalloc_memory()` function to measure how much memory
is used by the `tracemalloc` module.

The `PYTHONTRACEMALLOC` environment variable (`PYTHONTRACEMALLOC=NFRAME`) and
the `-X` `tracemalloc=NFRAME` command line option can be used to start tracing
at startup.

See also `stop()`, `is_tracing()` and `get_traceback_limit()` functions.

`tracemalloc.stop()`

    
Stop tracing Python memory allocations: uninstall hooks on Python memory
allocators. Also clears all previously collected traces of memory blocks
allocated by Python.

Call `take_snapshot()` function to take a snapshot of traces before clearing
them.

See also `start()`, `is_tracing()` and `clear_traces()` functions.

`tracemalloc.take_snapshot()`

    
Take a snapshot of traces of memory blocks allocated by Python. Return a new
`Snapshot` instance.

The snapshot does not include memory blocks allocated before the `tracemalloc`
module started to trace memory allocations.

Tracebacks of traces are limited to `get_traceback_limit()` frames. Use the
nframe parameter of the `start()` function to store more frames.

The `tracemalloc` module must be tracing memory allocations to take a
snapshot, see the `start()` function.

See also the `get_object_traceback()` function.

### DomainFilter

`class tracemalloc.DomainFilter(inclusive: bool, domain: int)`

    
Filter traces of memory blocks by their address space (domain).

New in version 3.6.

`inclusive`

    
If inclusive is `True` (include), match memory blocks allocated in the address
space `domain`.

If inclusive is `False` (exclude), match memory blocks not allocated in the
address space `domain`.

`domain`

    
Address space of a memory block (`int`). Read-only property.

### Filter

`class tracemalloc.Filter(inclusive: bool, filename_pattern: str, lineno:
int=None, all_frames: bool=False, domain: int=None)`

    
Filter on traces of memory blocks.

See the `fnmatch.fnmatch()` function for the syntax of filename_pattern. The
`'.pyc'` file extension is replaced with `'.py'`.

Examples:

  * `Filter(True, subprocess.__file__)` only includes traces of the `subprocess` module
  * `Filter(False, tracemalloc.__file__)` excludes traces of the `tracemalloc` module
  * `Filter(False, "<unknown>")` excludes empty tracebacks

Changed in version 3.5: The `'.pyo'` file extension is no longer replaced with
`'.py'`.

Changed in version 3.6: Added the `domain` attribute.

`domain`

    
Address space of a memory block (`int` or `None`).

tracemalloc uses the domain `0` to trace memory allocations made by Python. C
extensions can use other domains to trace other resources.

`inclusive`

    
If inclusive is `True` (include), only match memory blocks allocated in a file
with a name matching `filename_pattern` at line number `lineno`.

If inclusive is `False` (exclude), ignore memory blocks allocated in a file
with a name matching `filename_pattern` at line number `lineno`.

`lineno`

    
Line number (`int`) of the filter. If lineno is `None`, the filter matches any
line number.

`filename_pattern`

    
Filename pattern of the filter (`str`). Read-only property.

`all_frames`

    
If all_frames is `True`, all frames of the traceback are checked. If
all_frames is `False`, only the most recent frame is checked.

This attribute has no effect if the traceback limit is `1`. See the
`get_traceback_limit()` function and `Snapshot.traceback_limit` attribute.

### Frame

`class tracemalloc.Frame`

    
Frame of a traceback.

The `Traceback` class is a sequence of `Frame` instances.

`filename`

    
Filename (`str`).

`lineno`

    
Line number (`int`).

### Snapshot

`class tracemalloc.Snapshot`

    
Snapshot of traces of memory blocks allocated by Python.

The `take_snapshot()` function creates a snapshot instance.

`compare_to(old_snapshot: Snapshot, key_type: str, cumulative: bool=False)`

    
Compute the differences with an old snapshot. Get statistics as a sorted list
of `StatisticDiff` instances grouped by key_type.

See the `Snapshot.statistics()` method for key_type and cumulative parameters.

The result is sorted from the biggest to the smallest by: absolute value of
`StatisticDiff.size_diff`, `StatisticDiff.size`, absolute value of
`StatisticDiff.count_diff`, `Statistic.count` and then by
`StatisticDiff.traceback`.

`dump(filename)`

    
Write the snapshot into a file.

Use `load()` to reload the snapshot.

`filter_traces(filters)`

    
Create a new `Snapshot` instance with a filtered `traces` sequence, filters is
a list of `DomainFilter` and `Filter` instances. If filters is an empty list,
return a new `Snapshot` instance with a copy of the traces.

All inclusive filters are applied at once, a trace is ignored if no inclusive
filters match it. A trace is ignored if at least one exclusive filter matches
it.

Changed in version 3.6: `DomainFilter` instances are now also accepted in
filters.

`classmethod load(filename)`

    
Load a snapshot from a file.

See also `dump()`.

`statistics(key_type: str, cumulative: bool=False)`

    
Get statistics as a sorted list of `Statistic` instances grouped by key_type:

key_type | description  
---|---  
`'filename'` | filename  
`'lineno'` | filename and line number  
`'traceback'` | traceback  
If cumulative is `True`, cumulate size and count of memory blocks of all
frames of the traceback of a trace, not only the most recent frame. The
cumulative mode can only be used with key_type equals to `'filename'` and
`'lineno'`.

The result is sorted from the biggest to the smallest by: `Statistic.size`,
`Statistic.count` and then by `Statistic.traceback`.

`traceback_limit`

    
Maximum number of frames stored in the traceback of `traces`: result of the
`get_traceback_limit()` when the snapshot was taken.

`traces`

    
Traces of all memory blocks allocated by Python: sequence of `Trace`
instances.

The sequence has an undefined order. Use the `Snapshot.statistics()` method to
get a sorted list of statistics.

### Statistic

`class tracemalloc.Statistic`

    
Statistic on memory allocations.

`Snapshot.statistics()` returns a list of `Statistic` instances.

See also the `StatisticDiff` class.

`count`

    
Number of memory blocks (`int`).

`size`

    
Total size of memory blocks in bytes (`int`).

`traceback`

    
Traceback where the memory block was allocated, `Traceback` instance.

### StatisticDiff

`class tracemalloc.StatisticDiff`

    
Statistic difference on memory allocations between an old and a new `Snapshot`
instance.

`Snapshot.compare_to()` returns a list of `StatisticDiff` instances. See also
the `Statistic` class.

`count`

    
Number of memory blocks in the new snapshot (`int`): `0` if the memory blocks
have been released in the new snapshot.

`count_diff`

    
Difference of number of memory blocks between the old and the new snapshots
(`int`): `0` if the memory blocks have been allocated in the new snapshot.

`size`

    
Total size of memory blocks in bytes in the new snapshot (`int`): `0` if the
memory blocks have been released in the new snapshot.

`size_diff`

    
Difference of total size of memory blocks in bytes between the old and the new
snapshots (`int`): `0` if the memory blocks have been allocated in the new
snapshot.

`traceback`

    
Traceback where the memory blocks were allocated, `Traceback` instance.

### Trace

`class tracemalloc.Trace`

    
Trace of a memory block.

The `Snapshot.traces` attribute is a sequence of `Trace` instances.

Changed in version 3.6: Added the `domain` attribute.

`domain`

    
Address space of a memory block (`int`). Read-only property.

tracemalloc uses the domain `0` to trace memory allocations made by Python. C
extensions can use other domains to trace other resources.

`size`

    
Size of the memory block in bytes (`int`).

`traceback`

    
Traceback where the memory block was allocated, `Traceback` instance.

### Traceback

`class tracemalloc.Traceback`

    
Sequence of `Frame` instances sorted from the oldest frame to the most recent
frame.

A traceback contains at least `1` frame. If the `tracemalloc` module failed to
get a frame, the filename `"<unknown>"` at line number `0` is used.

When a snapshot is taken, tracebacks of traces are limited to
`get_traceback_limit()` frames. See the `take_snapshot()` function. The
original number of frames of the traceback is stored in the
`Traceback.total_nframe` attribute. That allows to know if a traceback has
been truncated by the traceback limit.

The `Trace.traceback` attribute is an instance of `Traceback` instance.

Changed in version 3.7: Frames are now sorted from the oldest to the most
recent, instead of most recent to oldest.

`total_nframe`

    
Total number of frames that composed the traceback before truncation. This
attribute can be set to `None` if the information is not available.

Changed in version 3.9: The `Traceback.total_nframe` attribute was added.

`format(limit=None, most_recent_first=False)`

    
Format the traceback as a list of lines with newlines. Use the `linecache`
module to retrieve lines from the source code. If limit is set, format the
limit most recent frames if limit is positive. Otherwise, format the
`abs(limit)` oldest frames. If most_recent_first is `True`, the order of the
formatted frames is reversed, returning the most recent frame first instead of
last.

Similar to the `traceback.format_tb()` function, except that `format()` does
not include newlines.

Example:

    
    print("Traceback (most recent call first):")
    for line in traceback:
        print(line)
    
Output:

    
    Traceback (most recent call first):
      File "test.py", line 9
        obj = Object()
      File "test.py", line 12
        tb = tracemalloc.get_object_traceback(f())
