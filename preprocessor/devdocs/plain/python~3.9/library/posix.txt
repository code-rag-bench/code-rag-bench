# posix — The most common POSIX system calls

This module provides access to operating system functionality that is
standardized by the C Standard and the POSIX standard (a thinly disguised Unix
interface).

Do not import this module directly. Instead, import the module `os`, which
provides a portable version of this interface. On Unix, the `os` module
provides a superset of the `posix` interface. On non-Unix operating systems
the `posix` module is not available, but a subset is always available through
the `os` interface. Once `os` is imported, there is no performance penalty in
using it instead of `posix`. In addition, `os` provides some additional
functionality, such as automatically calling `putenv()` when an entry in
`os.environ` is changed.

Errors are reported as exceptions; the usual exceptions are given for type
errors, while errors reported by the system calls raise `OSError`.

## Large File Support

Several operating systems (including AIX, HP-UX, Irix and Solaris) provide
support for files that are larger than 2 GiB from a C programming model where
`int` and `long` are 32-bit values. This is typically accomplished by defining
the relevant size and offset types as 64-bit values. Such files are sometimes
referred to as large files.

Large file support is enabled in Python when the size of an `off_t` is larger
than a `long` and the `long long` is at least as large as an `off_t`. It may
be necessary to configure and compile Python with certain compiler flags to
enable this mode. For example, it is enabled by default with recent versions
of Irix, but with Solaris 2.6 and 2.7 you need to do something like:

    
    CFLAGS="`getconf LFS_CFLAGS`" OPT="-g -O2 $CFLAGS" \
            ./configure
    
On large-file-capable Linux systems, this might work:

    
    CFLAGS='-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64' OPT="-g -O2 $CFLAGS" \
            ./configure
    
## Notable Module Contents

In addition to many functions described in the `os` module documentation,
`posix` defines the following data item:

`posix.environ`

    
A dictionary representing the string environment at the time the interpreter
was started. Keys and values are bytes on Unix and str on Windows. For
example, `environ[b'HOME']` (`environ['HOME']` on Windows) is the pathname of
your home directory, equivalent to `getenv("HOME")` in C.

Modifying this dictionary does not affect the string environment passed on by
`execv()`, `popen()` or `system()`; if you need to change the environment,
pass `environ` to `execve()` or add variable assignments and export statements
to the command string for `system()` or `popen()`.

Changed in version 3.2: On Unix, keys and values are bytes.

Note

The `os` module provides an alternate implementation of `environ` which
updates the environment on modification. Note also that updating `os.environ`
will render this dictionary obsolete. Use of the `os` module version of this
is recommended over direct access to the `posix` module.
