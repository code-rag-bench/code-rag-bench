# Synchronization Primitives

Source code: Lib/asyncio/locks.py

asyncio synchronization primitives are designed to be similar to those of the
`threading` module with two important caveats:

  * asyncio primitives are not thread-safe, therefore they should not be used for OS thread synchronization (use `threading` for that);
  * methods of these synchronization primitives do not accept the timeout argument; use the `asyncio.wait_for()` function to perform operations with timeouts.

asyncio has the following basic synchronization primitives:

  * `Lock`
  * `Event`
  * `Condition`
  * `Semaphore`
  * `BoundedSemaphore`

## Lock

`class asyncio.Lock(*, loop=None)`

    
Implements a mutex lock for asyncio tasks. Not thread-safe.

An asyncio lock can be used to guarantee exclusive access to a shared
resource.

The preferred way to use a Lock is an `async with` statement:

    
    lock = asyncio.Lock()
    
    # ... later
    async with lock:
        # access shared state
    
which is equivalent to:

    
    lock = asyncio.Lock()
    
    # ... later
    await lock.acquire()
    try:
        # access shared state
    finally:
        lock.release()
    
Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop
parameter.

`coroutine acquire()`

    
Acquire the lock.

This method waits until the lock is unlocked, sets it to locked and returns
`True`.

When more than one coroutine is blocked in `acquire()` waiting for the lock to
be unlocked, only one coroutine eventually proceeds.

Acquiring a lock is fair: the coroutine that proceeds will be the first
coroutine that started waiting on the lock.

`release()`

    
Release the lock.

When the lock is locked, reset it to unlocked and return.

If the lock is unlocked, a `RuntimeError` is raised.

`locked()`

    
Return `True` if the lock is locked.

## Event

`class asyncio.Event(*, loop=None)`

    
An event object. Not thread-safe.

An asyncio event can be used to notify multiple asyncio tasks that some event
has happened.

An Event object manages an internal flag that can be set to true with the
`set()` method and reset to false with the `clear()` method. The `wait()`
method blocks until the flag is set to true. The flag is set to false
initially.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop
parameter.

Example:

    
    async def waiter(event):
        print('waiting for it ...')
        await event.wait()
        print('... got it!')
    
    async def main():
        # Create an Event object.
        event = asyncio.Event()
    
        # Spawn a Task to wait until 'event' is set.
        waiter_task = asyncio.create_task(waiter(event))
    
        # Sleep for 1 second and set the event.
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        event.set()
    
        # Wait until the waiter task is finished.
        await waiter_task
    
    asyncio.run(main())
    
`coroutine wait()`

    
Wait until the event is set.

If the event is set, return `True` immediately. Otherwise block until another
task calls `set()`.

`set()`

    
Set the event.

All tasks waiting for event to be set will be immediately awakened.

`clear()`

    
Clear (unset) the event.

Tasks awaiting on `wait()` will now block until the `set()` method is called
again.

`is_set()`

    
Return `True` if the event is set.

## Condition

`class asyncio.Condition(lock=None, *, loop=None)`

    
A Condition object. Not thread-safe.

An asyncio condition primitive can be used by a task to wait for some event to
happen and then get exclusive access to a shared resource.

In essence, a Condition object combines the functionality of an `Event` and a
`Lock`. It is possible to have multiple Condition objects share one Lock,
which allows coordinating exclusive access to a shared resource between
different tasks interested in particular states of that shared resource.

The optional lock argument must be a `Lock` object or `None`. In the latter
case a new Lock object is created automatically.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop
parameter.

The preferred way to use a Condition is an `async with` statement:

    
    cond = asyncio.Condition()
    
    # ... later
    async with cond:
        await cond.wait()
    
which is equivalent to:

    
    cond = asyncio.Condition()
    
    # ... later
    await cond.acquire()
    try:
        await cond.wait()
    finally:
        cond.release()
    
`coroutine acquire()`

    
Acquire the underlying lock.

This method waits until the underlying lock is unlocked, sets it to locked and
returns `True`.

`notify(n=1)`

    
Wake up at most n tasks (1 by default) waiting on this condition. The method
is no-op if no tasks are waiting.

The lock must be acquired before this method is called and released shortly
after. If called with an unlocked lock a `RuntimeError` error is raised.

`locked()`

    
Return `True` if the underlying lock is acquired.

`notify_all()`

    
Wake up all tasks waiting on this condition.

This method acts like `notify()`, but wakes up all waiting tasks.

The lock must be acquired before this method is called and released shortly
after. If called with an unlocked lock a `RuntimeError` error is raised.

`release()`

    
Release the underlying lock.

When invoked on an unlocked lock, a `RuntimeError` is raised.

`coroutine wait()`

    
Wait until notified.

If the calling task has not acquired the lock when this method is called, a
`RuntimeError` is raised.

This method releases the underlying lock, and then blocks until it is awakened
by a `notify()` or `notify_all()` call. Once awakened, the Condition re-
acquires its lock and this method returns `True`.

`coroutine wait_for(predicate)`

    
Wait until a predicate becomes true.

The predicate must be a callable which result will be interpreted as a boolean
value. The final value is the return value.

## Semaphore

`class asyncio.Semaphore(value=1, *, loop=None)`

    
A Semaphore object. Not thread-safe.

A semaphore manages an internal counter which is decremented by each
`acquire()` call and incremented by each `release()` call. The counter can
never go below zero; when `acquire()` finds that it is zero, it blocks,
waiting until some task calls `release()`.

The optional value argument gives the initial value for the internal counter
(`1` by default). If the given value is less than `0` a `ValueError` is
raised.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop
parameter.

The preferred way to use a Semaphore is an `async with` statement:

    
    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(10)
    
    # ... later
    async with sem:
        # work with shared resource
    
which is equivalent to:

    
    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(10)
    
    # ... later
    await sem.acquire()
    try:
        # work with shared resource
    finally:
        sem.release()
    
`coroutine acquire()`

    
Acquire a semaphore.

If the internal counter is greater than zero, decrement it by one and return
`True` immediately. If it is zero, wait until a `release()` is called and
return `True`.

`locked()`

    
Returns `True` if semaphore can not be acquired immediately.

`release()`

    
Release a semaphore, incrementing the internal counter by one. Can wake up a
task waiting to acquire the semaphore.

Unlike `BoundedSemaphore`, `Semaphore` allows making more `release()` calls
than `acquire()` calls.

## BoundedSemaphore

`class asyncio.BoundedSemaphore(value=1, *, loop=None)`

    
A bounded semaphore object. Not thread-safe.

Bounded Semaphore is a version of `Semaphore` that raises a `ValueError` in
`release()` if it increases the internal counter above the initial value.

Deprecated since version 3.8, will be removed in version 3.10: The loop
parameter.

Changed in version 3.9: Acquiring a lock using `await lock` or `yield from
lock` and/or `with` statement (`with await lock`, `with (yield from lock)`)
was removed. Use `async with lock` instead.
