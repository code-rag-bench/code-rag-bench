# xml.dom.pulldom — Support for building partial DOM trees

Source code: Lib/xml/dom/pulldom.py

The `xml.dom.pulldom` module provides a “pull parser” which can also be asked
to produce DOM-accessible fragments of the document where necessary. The basic
concept involves pulling “events” from a stream of incoming XML and processing
them. In contrast to SAX which also employs an event-driven processing model
together with callbacks, the user of a pull parser is responsible for
explicitly pulling events from the stream, looping over those events until
either processing is finished or an error condition occurs.

Warning

The `xml.dom.pulldom` module is not secure against maliciously constructed
data. If you need to parse untrusted or unauthenticated data see XML
vulnerabilities.

Changed in version 3.7.1: The SAX parser no longer processes general external
entities by default to increase security by default. To enable processing of
external entities, pass a custom parser instance in:

    
    from xml.dom.pulldom import parse
    from xml.sax import make_parser
    from xml.sax.handler import feature_external_ges
    
    parser = make_parser()
    parser.setFeature(feature_external_ges, True)
    parse(filename, parser=parser)
    
Example:

    
    from xml.dom import pulldom
    
    doc = pulldom.parse('sales_items.xml')
    for event, node in doc:
        if event == pulldom.START_ELEMENT and node.tagName == 'item':
            if int(node.getAttribute('price')) > 50:
                doc.expandNode(node)
                print(node.toxml())
    
`event` is a constant and can be one of:

  * `START_ELEMENT`
  * `END_ELEMENT`
  * `COMMENT`
  * `START_DOCUMENT`
  * `END_DOCUMENT`
  * `CHARACTERS`
  * `PROCESSING_INSTRUCTION`
  * `IGNORABLE_WHITESPACE`

`node` is an object of type `xml.dom.minidom.Document`,
`xml.dom.minidom.Element` or `xml.dom.minidom.Text`.

Since the document is treated as a “flat” stream of events, the document
“tree” is implicitly traversed and the desired elements are found regardless
of their depth in the tree. In other words, one does not need to consider
hierarchical issues such as recursive searching of the document nodes,
although if the context of elements were important, one would either need to
maintain some context-related state (i.e. remembering where one is in the
document at any given point) or to make use of the
`DOMEventStream.expandNode()` method and switch to DOM-related processing.

`class xml.dom.pulldom.PullDom(documentFactory=None)`

    
Subclass of `xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler`.

`class xml.dom.pulldom.SAX2DOM(documentFactory=None)`

    
Subclass of `xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler`.

`xml.dom.pulldom.parse(stream_or_string, parser=None, bufsize=None)`

    
Return a `DOMEventStream` from the given input. stream_or_string may be either
a file name, or a file-like object. parser, if given, must be an `XMLReader`
object. This function will change the document handler of the parser and
activate namespace support; other parser configuration (like setting an entity
resolver) must have been done in advance.

If you have XML in a string, you can use the `parseString()` function instead:

`xml.dom.pulldom.parseString(string, parser=None)`

    
Return a `DOMEventStream` that represents the (Unicode) string.

`xml.dom.pulldom.default_bufsize`

    
Default value for the bufsize parameter to `parse()`.

The value of this variable can be changed before calling `parse()` and the new
value will take effect.

## DOMEventStream Objects

`class xml.dom.pulldom.DOMEventStream(stream, parser, bufsize)`

    
Deprecated since version 3.8: Support for `sequence protocol` is deprecated.

`getEvent()`

    
Return a tuple containing event and the current node as
`xml.dom.minidom.Document` if event equals `START_DOCUMENT`,
`xml.dom.minidom.Element` if event equals `START_ELEMENT` or `END_ELEMENT` or
`xml.dom.minidom.Text` if event equals `CHARACTERS`. The current node does not
contain information about its children, unless `expandNode()` is called.

`expandNode(node)`

    
Expands all children of node into node. Example:

    
    from xml.dom import pulldom
    
    xml = '<html><title>Foo</title> <p>Some text <div>and more</div></p> </html>'
    doc = pulldom.parseString(xml)
    for event, node in doc:
        if event == pulldom.START_ELEMENT and node.tagName == 'p':
            # Following statement only prints '<p/>'
            print(node.toxml())
            doc.expandNode(node)
            # Following statement prints node with all its children '<p>Some text <div>and more</div></p>'
            print(node.toxml())
    
`reset()`
