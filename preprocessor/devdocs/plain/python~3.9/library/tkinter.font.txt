# tkinter.font — Tkinter font wrapper

Source code: Lib/tkinter/font.py

The `tkinter.font` module provides the `Font` class for creating and using
named fonts.

The different font weights and slants are:

`tkinter.font.NORMAL`

`tkinter.font.BOLD`

`tkinter.font.ITALIC`

`tkinter.font.ROMAN`

`class tkinter.font.Font(root=None, font=None, name=None, exists=False,
**options)`

    
The `Font` class represents a named font. Font instances are given unique
names and can be specified by their family, size, and style configuration.
Named fonts are Tk’s method of creating and identifying fonts as a single
object, rather than specifying a font by its attributes with each occurrence.

arguments:

additional keyword options (ignored if font is specified):

`actual(option=None, displayof=None)`

    
Return the attributes of the font.

`cget(option)`

    
Retrieve an attribute of the font.

`config(**options)`

    
Modify attributes of the font.

`copy()`

    
Return new instance of the current font.

`measure(text, displayof=None)`

    
Return amount of space the text would occupy on the specified display when
formatted in the current font. If no display is specified then the main
application window is assumed.

`metrics(*options, **kw)`

    
Return font-specific data. Options include:

ascent \- distance between baseline and highest point that a

    
character of the font can occupy

descent \- distance between baseline and lowest point that a

    
character of the font can occupy

linespace \- minimum vertical separation necessary between any two

    
characters of the font that ensures no vertical overlap between lines.

fixed \- 1 if font is fixed-width else 0

`tkinter.font.families(root=None, displayof=None)`

    
Return the different font families.

`tkinter.font.names(root=None)`

    
Return the names of defined fonts.

`tkinter.font.nametofont(name)`

    
Return a `Font` representation of a tk named font.
