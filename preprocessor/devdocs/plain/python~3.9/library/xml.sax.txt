# xml.sax — Support for SAX2 parsers

Source code: Lib/xml/sax/__init__.py

The `xml.sax` package provides a number of modules which implement the Simple
API for XML (SAX) interface for Python. The package itself provides the SAX
exceptions and the convenience functions which will be most used by users of
the SAX API.

Warning

The `xml.sax` module is not secure against maliciously constructed data. If
you need to parse untrusted or unauthenticated data see XML vulnerabilities.

Changed in version 3.7.1: The SAX parser no longer processes general external
entities by default to increase security. Before, the parser created network
connections to fetch remote files or loaded local files from the file system
for DTD and entities. The feature can be enabled again with method
`setFeature()` on the parser object and argument `feature_external_ges`.

The convenience functions are:

`xml.sax.make_parser(parser_list=[])`

    
Create and return a SAX `XMLReader` object. The first parser found will be
used. If parser_list is provided, it must be an iterable of strings which name
modules that have a function named `create_parser()`. Modules listed in
parser_list will be used before modules in the default list of parsers.

Changed in version 3.8: The parser_list argument can be any iterable, not just
a list.

`xml.sax.parse(filename_or_stream, handler,
error_handler=handler.ErrorHandler())`

    
Create a SAX parser and use it to parse a document. The document, passed in as
filename_or_stream, can be a filename or a file object. The handler parameter
needs to be a SAX `ContentHandler` instance. If error_handler is given, it
must be a SAX `ErrorHandler` instance; if omitted, `SAXParseException` will be
raised on all errors. There is no return value; all work must be done by the
handler passed in.

`xml.sax.parseString(string, handler, error_handler=handler.ErrorHandler())`

    
Similar to `parse()`, but parses from a buffer string received as a parameter.
string must be a `str` instance or a bytes-like object.

Changed in version 3.5: Added support of `str` instances.

A typical SAX application uses three kinds of objects: readers, handlers and
input sources. “Reader” in this context is another term for parser, i.e. some
piece of code that reads the bytes or characters from the input source, and
produces a sequence of events. The events then get distributed to the handler
objects, i.e. the reader invokes a method on the handler. A SAX application
must therefore obtain a reader object, create or open the input sources,
create the handlers, and connect these objects all together. As the final step
of preparation, the reader is called to parse the input. During parsing,
methods on the handler objects are called based on structural and syntactic
events from the input data.

For these objects, only the interfaces are relevant; they are normally not
instantiated by the application itself. Since Python does not have an explicit
notion of interface, they are formally introduced as classes, but applications
may use implementations which do not inherit from the provided classes. The
`InputSource`, `Locator`, `Attributes`, `AttributesNS`, and `XMLReader`
interfaces are defined in the module `xml.sax.xmlreader`. The handler
interfaces are defined in `xml.sax.handler`. For convenience, `InputSource`
(which is often instantiated directly) and the handler classes are also
available from `xml.sax`. These interfaces are described below.

In addition to these classes, `xml.sax` provides the following exception
classes.

`exception xml.sax.SAXException(msg, exception=None)`

    
Encapsulate an XML error or warning. This class can contain basic error or
warning information from either the XML parser or the application: it can be
subclassed to provide additional functionality or to add localization. Note
that although the handlers defined in the `ErrorHandler` interface receive
instances of this exception, it is not required to actually raise the
exception — it is also useful as a container for information.

When instantiated, msg should be a human-readable description of the error.
The optional exception parameter, if given, should be `None` or an exception
that was caught by the parsing code and is being passed along as information.

This is the base class for the other SAX exception classes.

`exception xml.sax.SAXParseException(msg, exception, locator)`

    
Subclass of `SAXException` raised on parse errors. Instances of this class are
passed to the methods of the SAX `ErrorHandler` interface to provide
information about the parse error. This class supports the SAX `Locator`
interface as well as the `SAXException` interface.

`exception xml.sax.SAXNotRecognizedException(msg, exception=None)`

    
Subclass of `SAXException` raised when a SAX `XMLReader` is confronted with an
unrecognized feature or property. SAX applications and extensions may use this
class for similar purposes.

`exception xml.sax.SAXNotSupportedException(msg, exception=None)`

    
Subclass of `SAXException` raised when a SAX `XMLReader` is asked to enable a
feature that is not supported, or to set a property to a value that the
implementation does not support. SAX applications and extensions may use this
class for similar purposes.

## SAXException Objects

The `SAXException` exception class supports the following methods:

`SAXException.getMessage()`

    
Return a human-readable message describing the error condition.

`SAXException.getException()`

    
Return an encapsulated exception object, or `None`.
