# marshal — Internal Python object serialization

This module contains functions that can read and write Python values in a
binary format. The format is specific to Python, but independent of machine
architecture issues (e.g., you can write a Python value to a file on a PC,
transport the file to a Sun, and read it back there). Details of the format
are undocumented on purpose; it may change between Python versions (although
it rarely does). 1

This is not a general “persistence” module. For general persistence and
transfer of Python objects through RPC calls, see the modules `pickle` and
`shelve`. The `marshal` module exists mainly to support reading and writing
the “pseudo-compiled” code for Python modules of `.pyc` files. Therefore, the
Python maintainers reserve the right to modify the marshal format in backward
incompatible ways should the need arise. If you’re serializing and de-
serializing Python objects, use the `pickle` module instead – the performance
is comparable, version independence is guaranteed, and pickle supports a
substantially wider range of objects than marshal.

Warning

The `marshal` module is not intended to be secure against erroneous or
maliciously constructed data. Never unmarshal data received from an untrusted
or unauthenticated source.

Not all Python object types are supported; in general, only objects whose
value is independent from a particular invocation of Python can be written and
read by this module. The following types are supported: booleans, integers,
floating point numbers, complex numbers, strings, bytes, bytearrays, tuples,
lists, sets, frozensets, dictionaries, and code objects, where it should be
understood that tuples, lists, sets, frozensets and dictionaries are only
supported as long as the values contained therein are themselves supported.
The singletons `None`, `Ellipsis` and `StopIteration` can also be marshalled
and unmarshalled. For format version lower than 3, recursive lists, sets and
dictionaries cannot be written (see below).

There are functions that read/write files as well as functions operating on
bytes-like objects.

The module defines these functions:

`marshal.dump(value, file[, version])`

    
Write the value on the open file. The value must be a supported type. The file
must be a writeable binary file.

If the value has (or contains an object that has) an unsupported type, a
`ValueError` exception is raised — but garbage data will also be written to
the file. The object will not be properly read back by `load()`.

The version argument indicates the data format that `dump` should use (see
below).

`marshal.load(file)`

    
Read one value from the open file and return it. If no valid value is read
(e.g. because the data has a different Python version’s incompatible marshal
format), raise `EOFError`, `ValueError` or `TypeError`. The file must be a
readable binary file.

Note

If an object containing an unsupported type was marshalled with `dump()`,
`load()` will substitute `None` for the unmarshallable type.

`marshal.dumps(value[, version])`

    
Return the bytes object that would be written to a file by `dump(value,
file)`. The value must be a supported type. Raise a `ValueError` exception if
value has (or contains an object that has) an unsupported type.

The version argument indicates the data format that `dumps` should use (see
below).

`marshal.loads(bytes)`

    
Convert the bytes-like object to a value. If no valid value is found, raise
`EOFError`, `ValueError` or `TypeError`. Extra bytes in the input are ignored.

In addition, the following constants are defined:

`marshal.version`

    
Indicates the format that the module uses. Version 0 is the historical format,
version 1 shares interned strings and version 2 uses a binary format for
floating point numbers. Version 3 adds support for object instancing and
recursion. The current version is 4.

#### Footnotes

`1`

    
The name of this module stems from a bit of terminology used by the designers
of Modula-3 (amongst others), who use the term “marshalling” for shipping of
data around in a self-contained form. Strictly speaking, “to marshal” means to
convert some data from internal to external form (in an RPC buffer for
instance) and “unmarshalling” for the reverse process.
