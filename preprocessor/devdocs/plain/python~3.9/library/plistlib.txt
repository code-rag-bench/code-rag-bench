# plistlib — Generate and parse Apple .plist files

Source code: Lib/plistlib.py

This module provides an interface for reading and writing the “property list”
files used by Apple, primarily on macOS and iOS. This module supports both
binary and XML plist files.

The property list (`.plist`) file format is a simple serialization supporting
basic object types, like dictionaries, lists, numbers and strings. Usually the
top level object is a dictionary.

To write out and to parse a plist file, use the `dump()` and `load()`
functions.

To work with plist data in bytes objects, use `dumps()` and `loads()`.

Values can be strings, integers, floats, booleans, tuples, lists, dictionaries
(but only with string keys), `bytes`, `bytearray` or `datetime.datetime`
objects.

Changed in version 3.4: New API, old API deprecated. Support for binary format
plists added.

Changed in version 3.8: Support added for reading and writing `UID` tokens in
binary plists as used by NSKeyedArchiver and NSKeyedUnarchiver.

Changed in version 3.9: Old API removed.

PList manual page

    
Apple’s documentation of the file format.

This module defines the following functions:

`plistlib.load(fp, *, fmt=None, dict_type=dict)`

    
Read a plist file. fp should be a readable and binary file object. Return the
unpacked root object (which usually is a dictionary).

The fmt is the format of the file and the following values are valid:

  * `None`: Autodetect the file format
  * `FMT_XML`: XML file format
  * `FMT_BINARY`: Binary plist format

The dict_type is the type used for dictionaries that are read from the plist
file.

XML data for the `FMT_XML` format is parsed using the Expat parser from
`xml.parsers.expat` – see its documentation for possible exceptions on ill-
formed XML. Unknown elements will simply be ignored by the plist parser.

The parser for the binary format raises `InvalidFileException` when the file
cannot be parsed.

New in version 3.4.

`plistlib.loads(data, *, fmt=None, dict_type=dict)`

    
Load a plist from a bytes object. See `load()` for an explanation of the
keyword arguments.

New in version 3.4.

`plistlib.dump(value, fp, *, fmt=FMT_XML, sort_keys=True, skipkeys=False)`

    
Write value to a plist file. Fp should be a writable, binary file object.

The fmt argument specifies the format of the plist file and can be one of the
following values:

  * `FMT_XML`: XML formatted plist file
  * `FMT_BINARY`: Binary formatted plist file

When sort_keys is true (the default) the keys for dictionaries will be written
to the plist in sorted order, otherwise they will be written in the iteration
order of the dictionary.

When skipkeys is false (the default) the function raises `TypeError` when a
key of a dictionary is not a string, otherwise such keys are skipped.

A `TypeError` will be raised if the object is of an unsupported type or a
container that contains objects of unsupported types.

An `OverflowError` will be raised for integer values that cannot be
represented in (binary) plist files.

New in version 3.4.

`plistlib.dumps(value, *, fmt=FMT_XML, sort_keys=True, skipkeys=False)`

    
Return value as a plist-formatted bytes object. See the documentation for
`dump()` for an explanation of the keyword arguments of this function.

New in version 3.4.

The following classes are available:

`class plistlib.UID(data)`

    
Wraps an `int`. This is used when reading or writing NSKeyedArchiver encoded
data, which contains UID (see PList manual).

It has one attribute, `data`, which can be used to retrieve the int value of
the UID. `data` must be in the range `0 <= data < 2**64`.

New in version 3.8.

The following constants are available:

`plistlib.FMT_XML`

    
The XML format for plist files.

New in version 3.4.

`plistlib.FMT_BINARY`

    
The binary format for plist files

New in version 3.4.

## Examples

Generating a plist:

    
    pl = dict(
        aString = "Doodah",
        aList = ["A", "B", 12, 32.1, [1, 2, 3]],
        aFloat = 0.1,
        anInt = 728,
        aDict = dict(
            anotherString = "<hello & hi there!>",
            aThirdString = "M\xe4ssig, Ma\xdf",
            aTrueValue = True,
            aFalseValue = False,
        ),
        someData = b"<binary gunk>",
        someMoreData = b"<lots of binary gunk>" * 10,
        aDate = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(time.mktime(time.gmtime())),
    )
    with open(fileName, 'wb') as fp:
        dump(pl, fp)
    
Parsing a plist:

    
    with open(fileName, 'rb') as fp:
        pl = load(fp)
    print(pl["aKey"])
