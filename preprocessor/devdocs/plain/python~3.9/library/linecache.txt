# linecache — Random access to text lines

Source code: Lib/linecache.py

The `linecache` module allows one to get any line from a Python source file,
while attempting to optimize internally, using a cache, the common case where
many lines are read from a single file. This is used by the `traceback` module
to retrieve source lines for inclusion in the formatted traceback.

The `tokenize.open()` function is used to open files. This function uses
`tokenize.detect_encoding()` to get the encoding of the file; in the absence
of an encoding token, the file encoding defaults to UTF-8.

The `linecache` module defines the following functions:

`linecache.getline(filename, lineno, module_globals=None)`

    
Get line lineno from file named filename. This function will never raise an
exception — it will return `''` on errors (the terminating newline character
will be included for lines that are found).

If a file named filename is not found, the function first checks for a PEP 302
`__loader__` in module_globals. If there is such a loader and it defines a
`get_source` method, then that determines the source lines (if `get_source()`
returns `None`, then `''` is returned). Finally, if filename is a relative
filename, it is looked up relative to the entries in the module search path,
`sys.path`.

`linecache.clearcache()`

    
Clear the cache. Use this function if you no longer need lines from files
previously read using `getline()`.

`linecache.checkcache(filename=None)`

    
Check the cache for validity. Use this function if files in the cache may have
changed on disk, and you require the updated version. If filename is omitted,
it will check all the entries in the cache.

`linecache.lazycache(filename, module_globals)`

    
Capture enough detail about a non-file-based module to permit getting its
lines later via `getline()` even if module_globals is `None` in the later
call. This avoids doing I/O until a line is actually needed, without having to
carry the module globals around indefinitely.

New in version 3.5.

Example:

    
    >>> import linecache
    >>> linecache.getline(linecache.__file__, 8)
    'import sys\n'
