# glob — Unix style pathname pattern expansion

Source code: Lib/glob.py

The `glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern
according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned
in arbitrary order. No tilde expansion is done, but `*`, `?`, and character
ranges expressed with `[]` will be correctly matched. This is done by using
the `os.scandir()` and `fnmatch.fnmatch()` functions in concert, and not by
actually invoking a subshell. Note that unlike `fnmatch.fnmatch()`, `glob`
treats filenames beginning with a dot (`.`) as special cases. (For tilde and
shell variable expansion, use `os.path.expanduser()` and
`os.path.expandvars()`.)

For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets. For example,
`'[?]'` matches the character `'?'`.

The `pathlib` module offers high-level path objects.

`glob.glob(pathname, *, recursive=False)`

    
Return a possibly-empty list of path names that match pathname, which must be
a string containing a path specification. pathname can be either absolute
(like `/usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile`) or relative (like
`../../Tools/*/*.gif`), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken symlinks
are included in the results (as in the shell). Whether or not the results are
sorted depends on the file system. If a file that satisfies conditions is
removed or added during the call of this function, whether a path name for
that file be included is unspecified.

If recursive is true, the pattern “`**`” will match any files and zero or more
directories, subdirectories and symbolic links to directories. If the pattern
is followed by an `os.sep` or `os.altsep` then files will not match.

Raises an auditing event `glob.glob` with arguments `pathname`, `recursive`.

Note

Using the “`**`” pattern in large directory trees may consume an inordinate
amount of time.

Changed in version 3.5: Support for recursive globs using “`**`”.

`glob.iglob(pathname, *, recursive=False)`

    
Return an iterator which yields the same values as `glob()` without actually
storing them all simultaneously.

Raises an auditing event `glob.glob` with arguments `pathname`, `recursive`.

`glob.escape(pathname)`

    
Escape all special characters (`'?'`, `'*'` and `'['`). This is useful if you
want to match an arbitrary literal string that may have special characters in
it. Special characters in drive/UNC sharepoints are not escaped, e.g. on
Windows `escape('//?/c:/Quo vadis?.txt')` returns `'//?/c:/Quo vadis[?].txt'`.

New in version 3.4.

For example, consider a directory containing the following files: `1.gif`,
`2.txt`, `card.gif` and a subdirectory `sub` which contains only the file
`3.txt`. `glob()` will produce the following results. Notice how any leading
components of the path are preserved.

    
    >>> import glob
    >>> glob.glob('./[0-9].*')
    ['./1.gif', './2.txt']
    >>> glob.glob('*.gif')
    ['1.gif', 'card.gif']
    >>> glob.glob('?.gif')
    ['1.gif']
    >>> glob.glob('**/*.txt', recursive=True)
    ['2.txt', 'sub/3.txt']
    >>> glob.glob('./**/', recursive=True)
    ['./', './sub/']
    
If the directory contains files starting with `.` they won’t be matched by
default. For example, consider a directory containing `card.gif` and
`.card.gif`:

    
    >>> import glob
    >>> glob.glob('*.gif')
    ['card.gif']
    >>> glob.glob('.c*')
    ['.card.gif']
