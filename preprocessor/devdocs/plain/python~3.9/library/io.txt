# io — Core tools for working with streams

Source code: Lib/io.py

## Overview

The `io` module provides Python’s main facilities for dealing with various
types of I/O. There are three main types of I/O: text I/O, binary I/O and raw
I/O. These are generic categories, and various backing stores can be used for
each of them. A concrete object belonging to any of these categories is called
a file object. Other common terms are stream and file-like object.

Independent of its category, each concrete stream object will also have
various capabilities: it can be read-only, write-only, or read-write. It can
also allow arbitrary random access (seeking forwards or backwards to any
location), or only sequential access (for example in the case of a socket or
pipe).

All streams are careful about the type of data you give to them. For example
giving a `str` object to the `write()` method of a binary stream will raise a
`TypeError`. So will giving a `bytes` object to the `write()` method of a text
stream.

Changed in version 3.3: Operations that used to raise `IOError` now raise
`OSError`, since `IOError` is now an alias of `OSError`.

### Text I/O

Text I/O expects and produces `str` objects. This means that whenever the
backing store is natively made of bytes (such as in the case of a file),
encoding and decoding of data is made transparently as well as optional
translation of platform-specific newline characters.

The easiest way to create a text stream is with `open()`, optionally
specifying an encoding:

    
    f = open("myfile.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")
    
In-memory text streams are also available as `StringIO` objects:

    
    f = io.StringIO("some initial text data")
    
The text stream API is described in detail in the documentation of
`TextIOBase`.

### Binary I/O

Binary I/O (also called buffered I/O) expects bytes-like objects and produces
`bytes` objects. No encoding, decoding, or newline translation is performed.
This category of streams can be used for all kinds of non-text data, and also
when manual control over the handling of text data is desired.

The easiest way to create a binary stream is with `open()` with `'b'` in the
mode string:

    
    f = open("myfile.jpg", "rb")
    
In-memory binary streams are also available as `BytesIO` objects:

    
    f = io.BytesIO(b"some initial binary data: \x00\x01")
    
The binary stream API is described in detail in the docs of `BufferedIOBase`.

Other library modules may provide additional ways to create text or binary
streams. See `socket.socket.makefile()` for example.

### Raw I/O

Raw I/O (also called unbuffered I/O) is generally used as a low-level
building-block for binary and text streams; it is rarely useful to directly
manipulate a raw stream from user code. Nevertheless, you can create a raw
stream by opening a file in binary mode with buffering disabled:

    
    f = open("myfile.jpg", "rb", buffering=0)
    
The raw stream API is described in detail in the docs of `RawIOBase`.

## High-level Module Interface

`io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`

    
An int containing the default buffer size used by the module’s buffered I/O
classes. `open()` uses the file’s blksize (as obtained by `os.stat()`) if
possible.

`io.open(file, mode='r', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None,
newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)`

    
This is an alias for the builtin `open()` function.

This function raises an auditing event `open` with arguments `path`, `mode`
and `flags`. The `mode` and `flags` arguments may have been modified or
inferred from the original call.

`io.open_code(path)`

    
Opens the provided file with mode `'rb'`. This function should be used when
the intent is to treat the contents as executable code.

`path` should be a `str` and an absolute path.

The behavior of this function may be overridden by an earlier call to the
`PyFile_SetOpenCodeHook()`. However, assuming that `path` is a `str` and an
absolute path, `open_code(path)` should always behave the same as `open(path,
'rb')`. Overriding the behavior is intended for additional validation or
preprocessing of the file.

New in version 3.8.

`exception io.BlockingIOError`

    
This is a compatibility alias for the builtin `BlockingIOError` exception.

`exception io.UnsupportedOperation`

    
An exception inheriting `OSError` and `ValueError` that is raised when an
unsupported operation is called on a stream.

See also

`sys`

    
contains the standard IO streams: `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, and `sys.stderr`.

## Class hierarchy

The implementation of I/O streams is organized as a hierarchy of classes.
First abstract base classes (ABCs), which are used to specify the various
categories of streams, then concrete classes providing the standard stream
implementations.

Note

The abstract base classes also provide default implementations of some methods
in order to help implementation of concrete stream classes. For example,
`BufferedIOBase` provides unoptimized implementations of `readinto()` and
`readline()`.

At the top of the I/O hierarchy is the abstract base class `IOBase`. It
defines the basic interface to a stream. Note, however, that there is no
separation between reading and writing to streams; implementations are allowed
to raise `UnsupportedOperation` if they do not support a given operation.

The `RawIOBase` ABC extends `IOBase`. It deals with the reading and writing of
bytes to a stream. `FileIO` subclasses `RawIOBase` to provide an interface to
files in the machine’s file system.

The `BufferedIOBase` ABC extends `IOBase`. It deals with buffering on a raw
binary stream (`RawIOBase`). Its subclasses, `BufferedWriter`,
`BufferedReader`, and `BufferedRWPair` buffer raw binary streams that are
readable, writable, and both readable and writable, respectively.
`BufferedRandom` provides a buffered interface to seekable streams. Another
`BufferedIOBase` subclass, `BytesIO`, is a stream of in-memory bytes.

The `TextIOBase` ABC extends `IOBase`. It deals with streams whose bytes
represent text, and handles encoding and decoding to and from strings.
`TextIOWrapper`, which extends `TextIOBase`, is a buffered text interface to a
buffered raw stream (`BufferedIOBase`). Finally, `StringIO` is an in-memory
stream for text.

Argument names are not part of the specification, and only the arguments of
`open()` are intended to be used as keyword arguments.

The following table summarizes the ABCs provided by the `io` module:

ABC | Inherits | Stub Methods | Mixin Methods and Properties  
---|---|---|---  
`IOBase` |  | `fileno`, `seek`, and `truncate` | `close`, `closed`, `__enter__`, `__exit__`, `flush`, `isatty`, `__iter__`, `__next__`, `readable`, `readline`, `readlines`, `seekable`, `tell`, `writable`, and `writelines`  
`RawIOBase` | `IOBase` | `readinto` and `write` | Inherited `IOBase` methods, `read`, and `readall`  
`BufferedIOBase` | `IOBase` | `detach`, `read`, `read1`, and `write` | Inherited `IOBase` methods, `readinto`, and `readinto1`  
`TextIOBase` | `IOBase` | `detach`, `read`, `readline`, and `write` | Inherited `IOBase` methods, `encoding`, `errors`, and `newlines`  
### I/O Base Classes

`class io.IOBase`

    
The abstract base class for all I/O classes, acting on streams of bytes. There
is no public constructor.

This class provides empty abstract implementations for many methods that
derived classes can override selectively; the default implementations
represent a file that cannot be read, written or seeked.

Even though `IOBase` does not declare `read()` or `write()` because their
signatures will vary, implementations and clients should consider those
methods part of the interface. Also, implementations may raise a `ValueError`
(or `UnsupportedOperation`) when operations they do not support are called.

The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is `bytes`.
Other bytes-like objects are accepted as method arguments too. Text I/O
classes work with `str` data.

Note that calling any method (even inquiries) on a closed stream is undefined.
Implementations may raise `ValueError` in this case.

`IOBase` (and its subclasses) supports the iterator protocol, meaning that an
`IOBase` object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a stream. Lines are
defined slightly differently depending on whether the stream is a binary
stream (yielding bytes), or a text stream (yielding character strings). See
`readline()` below.

`IOBase` is also a context manager and therefore supports the `with`
statement. In this example, file is closed after the `with` statement’s suite
is finished—even if an exception occurs:

    
    with open('spam.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write('Spam and eggs!')
    
`IOBase` provides these data attributes and methods:

`close()`

    
Flush and close this stream. This method has no effect if the file is already
closed. Once the file is closed, any operation on the file (e.g. reading or
writing) will raise a `ValueError`.

As a convenience, it is allowed to call this method more than once; only the
first call, however, will have an effect.

`closed`

    
`True` if the stream is closed.

`fileno()`

    
Return the underlying file descriptor (an integer) of the stream if it exists.
An `OSError` is raised if the IO object does not use a file descriptor.

`flush()`

    
Flush the write buffers of the stream if applicable. This does nothing for
read-only and non-blocking streams.

`isatty()`

    
Return `True` if the stream is interactive (i.e., connected to a terminal/tty
device).

`readable()`

    
Return `True` if the stream can be read from. If `False`, `read()` will raise
`OSError`.

`readline(size=-1)`

    
Read and return one line from the stream. If size is specified, at most size
bytes will be read.

The line terminator is always `b'\n'` for binary files; for text files, the
newline argument to `open()` can be used to select the line terminator(s)
recognized.

`readlines(hint=-1)`

    
Read and return a list of lines from the stream. hint can be specified to
control the number of lines read: no more lines will be read if the total size
(in bytes/characters) of all lines so far exceeds hint.

Note that it’s already possible to iterate on file objects using `for line in
file: ...` without calling `file.readlines()`.

`seek(offset, whence=SEEK_SET)`

    
Change the stream position to the given byte offset. offset is interpreted
relative to the position indicated by whence. The default value for whence is
`SEEK_SET`. Values for whence are:

  * `SEEK_SET` or `0` – start of the stream (the default); offset should be zero or positive
  * `SEEK_CUR` or `1` – current stream position; offset may be negative
  * `SEEK_END` or `2` – end of the stream; offset is usually negative

Return the new absolute position.

New in version 3.1: The `SEEK_*` constants.

New in version 3.3: Some operating systems could support additional values,
like `os.SEEK_HOLE` or `os.SEEK_DATA`. The valid values for a file could
depend on it being open in text or binary mode.

`seekable()`

    
Return `True` if the stream supports random access. If `False`, `seek()`,
`tell()` and `truncate()` will raise `OSError`.

`tell()`

    
Return the current stream position.

`truncate(size=None)`

    
Resize the stream to the given size in bytes (or the current position if size
is not specified). The current stream position isn’t changed. This resizing
can extend or reduce the current file size. In case of extension, the contents
of the new file area depend on the platform (on most systems, additional bytes
are zero-filled). The new file size is returned.

Changed in version 3.5: Windows will now zero-fill files when extending.

`writable()`

    
Return `True` if the stream supports writing. If `False`, `write()` and
`truncate()` will raise `OSError`.

`writelines(lines)`

    
Write a list of lines to the stream. Line separators are not added, so it is
usual for each of the lines provided to have a line separator at the end.

`__del__()`

    
Prepare for object destruction. `IOBase` provides a default implementation of
this method that calls the instance’s `close()` method.

`class io.RawIOBase`

    
Base class for raw binary streams. It inherits `IOBase`. There is no public
constructor.

Raw binary streams typically provide low-level access to an underlying OS
device or API, and do not try to encapsulate it in high-level primitives (this
functionality is done at a higher-level in buffered binary streams and text
streams, described later in this page).

`RawIOBase` provides these methods in addition to those from `IOBase`:

`read(size=-1)`

    
Read up to size bytes from the object and return them. As a convenience, if
size is unspecified or -1, all bytes until EOF are returned. Otherwise, only
one system call is ever made. Fewer than size bytes may be returned if the
operating system call returns fewer than size bytes.

If 0 bytes are returned, and size was not 0, this indicates end of file. If
the object is in non-blocking mode and no bytes are available, `None` is
returned.

The default implementation defers to `readall()` and `readinto()`.

`readall()`

    
Read and return all the bytes from the stream until EOF, using multiple calls
to the stream if necessary.

`readinto(b)`

    
Read bytes into a pre-allocated, writable bytes-like object b, and return the
number of bytes read. For example, b might be a `bytearray`. If the object is
in non-blocking mode and no bytes are available, `None` is returned.

`write(b)`

    
Write the given bytes-like object, b, to the underlying raw stream, and return
the number of bytes written. This can be less than the length of b in bytes,
depending on specifics of the underlying raw stream, and especially if it is
in non-blocking mode. `None` is returned if the raw stream is set not to block
and no single byte could be readily written to it. The caller may release or
mutate b after this method returns, so the implementation should only access b
during the method call.

`class io.BufferedIOBase`

    
Base class for binary streams that support some kind of buffering. It inherits
`IOBase`. There is no public constructor.

The main difference with `RawIOBase` is that methods `read()`, `readinto()`
and `write()` will try (respectively) to read as much input as requested or to
consume all given output, at the expense of making perhaps more than one
system call.

In addition, those methods can raise `BlockingIOError` if the underlying raw
stream is in non-blocking mode and cannot take or give enough data; unlike
their `RawIOBase` counterparts, they will never return `None`.

Besides, the `read()` method does not have a default implementation that
defers to `readinto()`.

A typical `BufferedIOBase` implementation should not inherit from a
`RawIOBase` implementation, but wrap one, like `BufferedWriter` and
`BufferedReader` do.

`BufferedIOBase` provides or overrides these data attributes and methods in
addition to those from `IOBase`:

`raw`

    
The underlying raw stream (a `RawIOBase` instance) that `BufferedIOBase` deals
with. This is not part of the `BufferedIOBase` API and may not exist on some
implementations.

`detach()`

    
Separate the underlying raw stream from the buffer and return it.

After the raw stream has been detached, the buffer is in an unusable state.

Some buffers, like `BytesIO`, do not have the concept of a single raw stream
to return from this method. They raise `UnsupportedOperation`.

New in version 3.1.

`read(size=-1)`

    
Read and return up to size bytes. If the argument is omitted, `None`, or
negative, data is read and returned until EOF is reached. An empty `bytes`
object is returned if the stream is already at EOF.

If the argument is positive, and the underlying raw stream is not interactive,
multiple raw reads may be issued to satisfy the byte count (unless EOF is
reached first). But for interactive raw streams, at most one raw read will be
issued, and a short result does not imply that EOF is imminent.

A `BlockingIOError` is raised if the underlying raw stream is in non blocking-
mode, and has no data available at the moment.

`read1([size])`

    
Read and return up to size bytes, with at most one call to the underlying raw
stream’s `read()` (or `readinto()`) method. This can be useful if you are
implementing your own buffering on top of a `BufferedIOBase` object.

If size is `-1` (the default), an arbitrary number of bytes are returned (more
than zero unless EOF is reached).

`readinto(b)`

    
Read bytes into a pre-allocated, writable bytes-like object b and return the
number of bytes read. For example, b might be a `bytearray`.

Like `read()`, multiple reads may be issued to the underlying raw stream,
unless the latter is interactive.

A `BlockingIOError` is raised if the underlying raw stream is in non blocking-
mode, and has no data available at the moment.

`readinto1(b)`

    
Read bytes into a pre-allocated, writable bytes-like object b, using at most
one call to the underlying raw stream’s `read()` (or `readinto()`) method.
Return the number of bytes read.

A `BlockingIOError` is raised if the underlying raw stream is in non blocking-
mode, and has no data available at the moment.

New in version 3.5.

`write(b)`

    
Write the given bytes-like object, b, and return the number of bytes written
(always equal to the length of b in bytes, since if the write fails an
`OSError` will be raised). Depending on the actual implementation, these bytes
may be readily written to the underlying stream, or held in a buffer for
performance and latency reasons.

When in non-blocking mode, a `BlockingIOError` is raised if the data needed to
be written to the raw stream but it couldn’t accept all the data without
blocking.

The caller may release or mutate b after this method returns, so the
implementation should only access b during the method call.

### Raw File I/O

`class io.FileIO(name, mode='r', closefd=True, opener=None)`

    
A raw binary stream representing an OS-level file containing bytes data. It
inherits `RawIOBase`.

The name can be one of two things:

  * a character string or `bytes` object representing the path to the file which will be opened. In this case closefd must be `True` (the default) otherwise an error will be raised.
  * an integer representing the number of an existing OS-level file descriptor to which the resulting `FileIO` object will give access. When the FileIO object is closed this fd will be closed as well, unless closefd is set to `False`.

The mode can be `'r'`, `'w'`, `'x'` or `'a'` for reading (default), writing,
exclusive creation or appending. The file will be created if it doesn’t exist
when opened for writing or appending; it will be truncated when opened for
writing. `FileExistsError` will be raised if it already exists when opened for
creating. Opening a file for creating implies writing, so this mode behaves in
a similar way to `'w'`. Add a `'+'` to the mode to allow simultaneous reading
and writing.

The `read()` (when called with a positive argument), `readinto()` and
`write()` methods on this class will only make one system call.

A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as opener. The underlying
file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by calling opener with
(name, flags). opener must return an open file descriptor (passing `os.open`
as opener results in functionality similar to passing `None`).

The newly created file is non-inheritable.

See the `open()` built-in function for examples on using the opener parameter.

Changed in version 3.3: The opener parameter was added. The `'x'` mode was
added.

Changed in version 3.4: The file is now non-inheritable.

`FileIO` provides these data attributes in addition to those from `RawIOBase`
and `IOBase`:

`mode`

    
The mode as given in the constructor.

`name`

    
The file name. This is the file descriptor of the file when no name is given
in the constructor.

### Buffered Streams

Buffered I/O streams provide a higher-level interface to an I/O device than
raw I/O does.

`class io.BytesIO([initial_bytes])`

    
A binary stream using an in-memory bytes buffer. It inherits `BufferedIOBase`.
The buffer is discarded when the `close()` method is called.

The optional argument initial_bytes is a bytes-like object that contains
initial data.

`BytesIO` provides or overrides these methods in addition to those from
`BufferedIOBase` and `IOBase`:

`getbuffer()`

    
Return a readable and writable view over the contents of the buffer without
copying them. Also, mutating the view will transparently update the contents
of the buffer:

    
    >>> b = io.BytesIO(b"abcdef")
    >>> view = b.getbuffer()
    >>> view[2:4] = b"56"
    >>> b.getvalue()
    b'ab56ef'
    
Note

As long as the view exists, the `BytesIO` object cannot be resized or closed.

New in version 3.2.

`getvalue()`

    
Return `bytes` containing the entire contents of the buffer.

`read1([size])`

    
In `BytesIO`, this is the same as `read()`.

Changed in version 3.7: The size argument is now optional.

`readinto1(b)`

    
In `BytesIO`, this is the same as `readinto()`.

New in version 3.5.

`class io.BufferedReader(raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)`

    
A buffered binary stream providing higher-level access to a readable, non
seekable `RawIOBase` raw binary stream. It inherits `BufferedIOBase`.

When reading data from this object, a larger amount of data may be requested
from the underlying raw stream, and kept in an internal buffer. The buffered
data can then be returned directly on subsequent reads.

The constructor creates a `BufferedReader` for the given readable raw stream
and buffer_size. If buffer_size is omitted, `DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE` is used.

`BufferedReader` provides or overrides these methods in addition to those from
`BufferedIOBase` and `IOBase`:

`peek([size])`

    
Return bytes from the stream without advancing the position. At most one
single read on the raw stream is done to satisfy the call. The number of bytes
returned may be less or more than requested.

`read([size])`

    
Read and return size bytes, or if size is not given or negative, until EOF or
if the read call would block in non-blocking mode.

`read1([size])`

    
Read and return up to size bytes with only one call on the raw stream. If at
least one byte is buffered, only buffered bytes are returned. Otherwise, one
raw stream read call is made.

Changed in version 3.7: The size argument is now optional.

`class io.BufferedWriter(raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)`

    
A buffered binary stream providing higher-level access to a writeable, non
seekable `RawIOBase` raw binary stream. It inherits `BufferedIOBase`.

When writing to this object, data is normally placed into an internal buffer.
The buffer will be written out to the underlying `RawIOBase` object under
various conditions, including:

  * when the buffer gets too small for all pending data;
  * when `flush()` is called;
  * when a `seek()` is requested (for `BufferedRandom` objects);
  * when the `BufferedWriter` object is closed or destroyed.

The constructor creates a `BufferedWriter` for the given writeable raw stream.
If the buffer_size is not given, it defaults to `DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`.

`BufferedWriter` provides or overrides these methods in addition to those from
`BufferedIOBase` and `IOBase`:

`flush()`

    
Force bytes held in the buffer into the raw stream. A `BlockingIOError` should
be raised if the raw stream blocks.

`write(b)`

    
Write the bytes-like object, b, and return the number of bytes written. When
in non-blocking mode, a `BlockingIOError` is raised if the buffer needs to be
written out but the raw stream blocks.

`class io.BufferedRandom(raw, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)`

    
A buffered binary stream providing higher-level access to a seekable
`RawIOBase` raw binary stream. It inherits `BufferedReader` and
`BufferedWriter`.

The constructor creates a reader and writer for a seekable raw stream, given
in the first argument. If the buffer_size is omitted it defaults to
`DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`.

`BufferedRandom` is capable of anything `BufferedReader` or `BufferedWriter`
can do. In addition, `seek()` and `tell()` are guaranteed to be implemented.

`class io.BufferedRWPair(reader, writer, buffer_size=DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE)`

    
A buffered binary stream providing higher-level access to two non seekable
`RawIOBase` raw binary streams—one readable, the other writeable. It inherits
`BufferedIOBase`.

reader and writer are `RawIOBase` objects that are readable and writeable
respectively. If the buffer_size is omitted it defaults to
`DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE`.

`BufferedRWPair` implements all of `BufferedIOBase`’s methods except for
`detach()`, which raises `UnsupportedOperation`.

Warning

`BufferedRWPair` does not attempt to synchronize accesses to its underlying
raw streams. You should not pass it the same object as reader and writer; use
`BufferedRandom` instead.

### Text I/O

`class io.TextIOBase`

    
Base class for text streams. This class provides a character and line based
interface to stream I/O. It inherits `IOBase`. There is no public constructor.

`TextIOBase` provides or overrides these data attributes and methods in
addition to those from `IOBase`:

`encoding`

    
The name of the encoding used to decode the stream’s bytes into strings, and
to encode strings into bytes.

`errors`

    
The error setting of the decoder or encoder.

`newlines`

    
A string, a tuple of strings, or `None`, indicating the newlines translated so
far. Depending on the implementation and the initial constructor flags, this
may not be available.

`buffer`

    
The underlying binary buffer (a `BufferedIOBase` instance) that `TextIOBase`
deals with. This is not part of the `TextIOBase` API and may not exist in some
implementations.

`detach()`

    
Separate the underlying binary buffer from the `TextIOBase` and return it.

After the underlying buffer has been detached, the `TextIOBase` is in an
unusable state.

Some `TextIOBase` implementations, like `StringIO`, may not have the concept
of an underlying buffer and calling this method will raise
`UnsupportedOperation`.

New in version 3.1.

`read(size=-1)`

    
Read and return at most size characters from the stream as a single `str`. If
size is negative or `None`, reads until EOF.

`readline(size=-1)`

    
Read until newline or EOF and return a single `str`. If the stream is already
at EOF, an empty string is returned.

If size is specified, at most size characters will be read.

`seek(offset, whence=SEEK_SET)`

    
Change the stream position to the given offset. Behaviour depends on the
whence parameter. The default value for whence is `SEEK_SET`.

  * `SEEK_SET` or `0`: seek from the start of the stream (the default); offset must either be a number returned by `TextIOBase.tell()`, or zero. Any other offset value produces undefined behaviour.
  * `SEEK_CUR` or `1`: “seek” to the current position; offset must be zero, which is a no-operation (all other values are unsupported).
  * `SEEK_END` or `2`: seek to the end of the stream; offset must be zero (all other values are unsupported).

Return the new absolute position as an opaque number.

New in version 3.1: The `SEEK_*` constants.

`tell()`

    
Return the current stream position as an opaque number. The number does not
usually represent a number of bytes in the underlying binary storage.

`write(s)`

    
Write the string s to the stream and return the number of characters written.

`class io.TextIOWrapper(buffer, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None,
line_buffering=False, write_through=False)`

    
A buffered text stream providing higher-level access to a `BufferedIOBase`
buffered binary stream. It inherits `TextIOBase`.

encoding gives the name of the encoding that the stream will be decoded or
encoded with. It defaults to `locale.getpreferredencoding(False)`.

errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors
are to be handled. Pass `'strict'` to raise a `ValueError` exception if there
is an encoding error (the default of `None` has the same effect), or pass
`'ignore'` to ignore errors. (Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to
data loss.) `'replace'` causes a replacement marker (such as `'?'`) to be
inserted where there is malformed data. `'backslashreplace'` causes malformed
data to be replaced by a backslashed escape sequence. When writing,
`'xmlcharrefreplace'` (replace with the appropriate XML character reference)
or `'namereplace'` (replace with `\N{...}` escape sequences) can be used. Any
other error handling name that has been registered with
`codecs.register_error()` is also valid.

newline controls how line endings are handled. It can be `None`, `''`, `'\n'`,
`'\r'`, and `'\r\n'`. It works as follows:

  * When reading input from the stream, if newline is `None`, universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in `'\n'`, `'\r'`, or `'\r\n'`, and these are translated into `'\n'` before being returned to the caller. If newline is `''`, universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If newline has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.
  * When writing output to the stream, if newline is `None`, any `'\n'` characters written are translated to the system default line separator, `os.linesep`. If newline is `''` or `'\n'`, no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any `'\n'` characters written are translated to the given string.

If line_buffering is `True`, `flush()` is implied when a call to write
contains a newline character or a carriage return.

If write_through is `True`, calls to `write()` are guaranteed not to be
buffered: any data written on the `TextIOWrapper` object is immediately
handled to its underlying binary buffer.

Changed in version 3.3: The write_through argument has been added.

Changed in version 3.3: The default encoding is now
`locale.getpreferredencoding(False)` instead of
`locale.getpreferredencoding()`. Don’t change temporary the locale encoding
using `locale.setlocale()`, use the current locale encoding instead of the
user preferred encoding.

`TextIOWrapper` provides these data attributes and methods in addition to
those from `TextIOBase` and `IOBase`:

`line_buffering`

    
Whether line buffering is enabled.

`write_through`

    
Whether writes are passed immediately to the underlying binary buffer.

New in version 3.7.

`reconfigure(*[, encoding][, errors][, newline][, line_buffering][,
write_through])`

    
Reconfigure this text stream using new settings for encoding, errors, newline,
line_buffering and write_through.

Parameters not specified keep current settings, except `errors='strict'` is
used when encoding is specified but errors is not specified.

It is not possible to change the encoding or newline if some data has already
been read from the stream. On the other hand, changing encoding after write is
possible.

This method does an implicit stream flush before setting the new parameters.

New in version 3.7.

`class io.StringIO(initial_value='', newline='\n')`

    
A text stream using an in-memory text buffer. It inherits `TextIOBase`.

The text buffer is discarded when the `close()` method is called.

The initial value of the buffer can be set by providing initial_value. If
newline translation is enabled, newlines will be encoded as if by `write()`.
The stream is positioned at the start of the buffer.

The newline argument works like that of `TextIOWrapper`, except that when
writing output to the stream, if newline is `None`, newlines are written as
`\n` on all platforms.

`StringIO` provides this method in addition to those from `TextIOBase` and
`IOBase`:

`getvalue()`

    
Return a `str` containing the entire contents of the buffer. Newlines are
decoded as if by `read()`, although the stream position is not changed.

Example usage:

    
    import io
    
    output = io.StringIO()
    output.write('First line.\n')
    print('Second line.', file=output)
    
    # Retrieve file contents -- this will be
    # 'First line.\nSecond line.\n'
    contents = output.getvalue()
    
    # Close object and discard memory buffer --
    # .getvalue() will now raise an exception.
    output.close()
    
`class io.IncrementalNewlineDecoder`

    
A helper codec that decodes newlines for universal newlines mode. It inherits
`codecs.IncrementalDecoder`.

## Performance

This section discusses the performance of the provided concrete I/O
implementations.

### Binary I/O

By reading and writing only large chunks of data even when the user asks for a
single byte, buffered I/O hides any inefficiency in calling and executing the
operating system’s unbuffered I/O routines. The gain depends on the OS and the
kind of I/O which is performed. For example, on some modern OSes such as
Linux, unbuffered disk I/O can be as fast as buffered I/O. The bottom line,
however, is that buffered I/O offers predictable performance regardless of the
platform and the backing device. Therefore, it is almost always preferable to
use buffered I/O rather than unbuffered I/O for binary data.

### Text I/O

Text I/O over a binary storage (such as a file) is significantly slower than
binary I/O over the same storage, because it requires conversions between
unicode and binary data using a character codec. This can become noticeable
handling huge amounts of text data like large log files. Also,
`TextIOWrapper.tell()` and `TextIOWrapper.seek()` are both quite slow due to
the reconstruction algorithm used.

`StringIO`, however, is a native in-memory unicode container and will exhibit
similar speed to `BytesIO`.

### Multi-threading

`FileIO` objects are thread-safe to the extent that the operating system calls
(such as `read(2)` under Unix) they wrap are thread-safe too.

Binary buffered objects (instances of `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`,
`BufferedRandom` and `BufferedRWPair`) protect their internal structures using
a lock; it is therefore safe to call them from multiple threads at once.

`TextIOWrapper` objects are not thread-safe.

### Reentrancy

Binary buffered objects (instances of `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`,
`BufferedRandom` and `BufferedRWPair`) are not reentrant. While reentrant
calls will not happen in normal situations, they can arise from doing I/O in a
`signal` handler. If a thread tries to re-enter a buffered object which it is
already accessing, a `RuntimeError` is raised. Note this doesn’t prohibit a
different thread from entering the buffered object.

The above implicitly extends to text files, since the `open()` function will
wrap a buffered object inside a `TextIOWrapper`. This includes standard
streams and therefore affects the built-in `print()` function as well.
