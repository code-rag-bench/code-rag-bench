# inspect — Inspect live objects

Source code: Lib/inspect.py

The `inspect` module provides several useful functions to help get information
about live objects such as modules, classes, methods, functions, tracebacks,
frame objects, and code objects. For example, it can help you examine the
contents of a class, retrieve the source code of a method, extract and format
the argument list for a function, or get all the information you need to
display a detailed traceback.

There are four main kinds of services provided by this module: type checking,
getting source code, inspecting classes and functions, and examining the
interpreter stack.

## Types and members

The `getmembers()` function retrieves the members of an object such as a class
or module. The functions whose names begin with “is” are mainly provided as
convenient choices for the second argument to `getmembers()`. They also help
you determine when you can expect to find the following special attributes:

Type | Attribute | Description  
---|---|---  
module | __doc__ | documentation string  
| __file__ | filename (missing for built-in modules)  
class | __doc__ | documentation string  
| __name__ | name with which this class was defined  
| __qualname__ | qualified name  
| __module__ | name of module in which this class was defined

| __name__ | name with which this method was defined  
| __qualname__ | qualified name  
| __func__ | function object containing implementation of method  
| __self__ | instance to which this method is bound, or `None`  
| __module__ | name of module in which this method was defined  
function | __doc__ | documentation string  
| __name__ | name with which this function was defined  
| __qualname__ | qualified name

| __defaults__ | tuple of any default values for positional or keyword parameters  
| __kwdefaults__ | mapping of any default values for keyword-only parameters  
| __globals__ | global namespace in which this function was defined  
| __annotations__ | mapping of parameters names to annotations; `"return"` key is reserved for return annotations.  
| __module__ | name of module in which this function was defined  
traceback | tb_frame | frame object at this level  
| tb_lasti | index of last attempted instruction in bytecode  
| tb_lineno | current line number in Python source code  
| tb_next | next inner traceback object (called by this level)  
frame | f_back | next outer frame object (this frame’s caller)  
| f_builtins | builtins namespace seen by this frame  
| f_code | code object being executed in this frame  
| f_globals | global namespace seen by this frame  
| f_lasti | index of last attempted instruction in bytecode  
| f_lineno | current line number in Python source code  
| f_locals | local namespace seen by this frame  
| f_trace | tracing function for this frame, or `None`  
code | co_argcount | number of arguments (not including keyword only arguments, * or ** args)  
| co_code | string of raw compiled bytecode  
| co_cellvars | tuple of names of cell variables (referenced by containing scopes)

| co_filename | name of file in which this code object was created  
| co_firstlineno | number of first line in Python source code  
| co_flags | bitmap of `CO_*` flags, read more here  
| co_lnotab | encoded mapping of line numbers to bytecode indices  
| co_freevars | tuple of names of free variables (referenced via a function’s closure)  
| co_posonlyargcount | number of positional only arguments  
| co_kwonlyargcount | number of keyword only arguments (not including ** arg)  
| co_name | name with which this code object was defined  
| co_names | tuple of names of local variables  
| co_nlocals | number of local variables  
| co_stacksize | virtual machine stack space required  
| co_varnames | tuple of names of arguments and local variables  
generator | __name__ | name  
| __qualname__ | qualified name  
| gi_frame | frame  
| gi_running | is the generator running?  
| gi_code | code  
| gi_yieldfrom | object being iterated by `yield from`, or `None`  
coroutine | __name__ | name  
| __qualname__ | qualified name  
| cr_await | object being awaited on, or `None`  
| cr_frame | frame  
| cr_running | is the coroutine running?  
| cr_code | code  
| cr_origin | where coroutine was created, or `None`. See `sys.set_coroutine_origin_tracking_depth()`  
builtin | __doc__ | documentation string  
| __name__ | original name of this function or method  
| __qualname__ | qualified name  
| __self__ | instance to which a method is bound, or `None`  
Changed in version 3.5: Add `__qualname__` and `gi_yieldfrom` attributes to
generators.

The `__name__` attribute of generators is now set from the function name,
instead of the code name, and it can now be modified.

Changed in version 3.7: Add `cr_origin` attribute to coroutines.

`inspect.getmembers(object[, predicate])`

    
Return all the members of an object in a list of `(name, value)` pairs sorted
by name. If the optional predicate argument—which will be called with the
`value` object of each member—is supplied, only members for which the
predicate returns a true value are included.

Note

`getmembers()` will only return class attributes defined in the metaclass when
the argument is a class and those attributes have been listed in the
metaclass’ custom `__dir__()`.

`inspect.getmodulename(path)`

    
Return the name of the module named by the file path, without including the
names of enclosing packages. The file extension is checked against all of the
entries in `importlib.machinery.all_suffixes()`. If it matches, the final path
component is returned with the extension removed. Otherwise, `None` is
returned.

Note that this function only returns a meaningful name for actual Python
modules - paths that potentially refer to Python packages will still return
`None`.

Changed in version 3.3: The function is based directly on `importlib`.

`inspect.ismodule(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a module.

`inspect.isclass(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a class, whether built-in or created in Python
code.

`inspect.ismethod(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a bound method written in Python.

`inspect.isfunction(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a Python function, which includes functions
created by a lambda expression.

`inspect.isgeneratorfunction(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a Python generator function.

Changed in version 3.8: Functions wrapped in `functools.partial()` now return
`True` if the wrapped function is a Python generator function.

`inspect.isgenerator(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a generator.

`inspect.iscoroutinefunction(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a coroutine function (a function defined with
an `async def` syntax).

New in version 3.5.

Changed in version 3.8: Functions wrapped in `functools.partial()` now return
`True` if the wrapped function is a coroutine function.

`inspect.iscoroutine(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a coroutine created by an `async def` function.

New in version 3.5.

`inspect.isawaitable(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object can be used in `await` expression.

Can also be used to distinguish generator-based coroutines from regular
generators:

    
    def gen():
        yield
    @types.coroutine
    def gen_coro():
        yield
    
    assert not isawaitable(gen())
    assert isawaitable(gen_coro())
    
New in version 3.5.

`inspect.isasyncgenfunction(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is an asynchronous generator function, for
example:

    
    >>> async def agen():
    ...     yield 1
    ...
    >>> inspect.isasyncgenfunction(agen)
    True
    
New in version 3.6.

Changed in version 3.8: Functions wrapped in `functools.partial()` now return
`True` if the wrapped function is a asynchronous generator function.

`inspect.isasyncgen(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is an asynchronous generator iterator created by
an asynchronous generator function.

New in version 3.6.

`inspect.istraceback(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a traceback.

`inspect.isframe(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a frame.

`inspect.iscode(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a code.

`inspect.isbuiltin(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a built-in function or a bound built-in method.

`inspect.isroutine(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a user-defined or built-in function or method.

`inspect.isabstract(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is an abstract base class.

`inspect.ismethoddescriptor(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a method descriptor, but not if `ismethod()`,
`isclass()`, `isfunction()` or `isbuiltin()` are true.

This, for example, is true of `int.__add__`. An object passing this test has a
`__get__()` method but not a `__set__()` method, but beyond that the set of
attributes varies. A `__name__` attribute is usually sensible, and `__doc__`
often is.

Methods implemented via descriptors that also pass one of the other tests
return `False` from the `ismethoddescriptor()` test, simply because the other
tests promise more – you can, e.g., count on having the `__func__` attribute
(etc) when an object passes `ismethod()`.

`inspect.isdatadescriptor(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a data descriptor.

Data descriptors have a `__set__` or a `__delete__` method. Examples are
properties (defined in Python), getsets, and members. The latter two are
defined in C and there are more specific tests available for those types,
which is robust across Python implementations. Typically, data descriptors
will also have `__name__` and `__doc__` attributes (properties, getsets, and
members have both of these attributes), but this is not guaranteed.

`inspect.isgetsetdescriptor(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a getset descriptor.

CPython implementation detail: getsets are attributes defined in extension
modules via `PyGetSetDef` structures. For Python implementations without such
types, this method will always return `False`.

`inspect.ismemberdescriptor(object)`

    
Return `True` if the object is a member descriptor.

CPython implementation detail: Member descriptors are attributes defined in
extension modules via `PyMemberDef` structures. For Python implementations
without such types, this method will always return `False`.

## Retrieving source code

`inspect.getdoc(object)`

    
Get the documentation string for an object, cleaned up with `cleandoc()`. If
the documentation string for an object is not provided and the object is a
class, a method, a property or a descriptor, retrieve the documentation string
from the inheritance hierarchy.

Changed in version 3.5: Documentation strings are now inherited if not
overridden.

`inspect.getcomments(object)`

    
Return in a single string any lines of comments immediately preceding the
object’s source code (for a class, function, or method), or at the top of the
Python source file (if the object is a module). If the object’s source code is
unavailable, return `None`. This could happen if the object has been defined
in C or the interactive shell.

`inspect.getfile(object)`

    
Return the name of the (text or binary) file in which an object was defined.
This will fail with a `TypeError` if the object is a built-in module, class,
or function.

`inspect.getmodule(object)`

    
Try to guess which module an object was defined in.

`inspect.getsourcefile(object)`

    
Return the name of the Python source file in which an object was defined. This
will fail with a `TypeError` if the object is a built-in module, class, or
function.

`inspect.getsourcelines(object)`

    
Return a list of source lines and starting line number for an object. The
argument may be a module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code
object. The source code is returned as a list of the lines corresponding to
the object and the line number indicates where in the original source file the
first line of code was found. An `OSError` is raised if the source code cannot
be retrieved.

Changed in version 3.3: `OSError` is raised instead of `IOError`, now an alias
of the former.

`inspect.getsource(object)`

    
Return the text of the source code for an object. The argument may be a
module, class, method, function, traceback, frame, or code object. The source
code is returned as a single string. An `OSError` is raised if the source code
cannot be retrieved.

Changed in version 3.3: `OSError` is raised instead of `IOError`, now an alias
of the former.

`inspect.cleandoc(doc)`

    
Clean up indentation from docstrings that are indented to line up with blocks
of code.

All leading whitespace is removed from the first line. Any leading whitespace
that can be uniformly removed from the second line onwards is removed. Empty
lines at the beginning and end are subsequently removed. Also, all tabs are
expanded to spaces.

## Introspecting callables with the Signature object

New in version 3.3.

The Signature object represents the call signature of a callable object and
its return annotation. To retrieve a Signature object, use the `signature()`
function.

`inspect.signature(callable, *, follow_wrapped=True)`

    
Return a `Signature` object for the given `callable`:

    
    >>> from inspect import signature
    >>> def foo(a, *, b:int, **kwargs):
    ...     pass
    
    >>> sig = signature(foo)
    
    >>> str(sig)
    '(a, *, b:int, **kwargs)'
    
    >>> str(sig.parameters['b'])
    'b:int'
    
    >>> sig.parameters['b'].annotation
    <class 'int'>
    
Accepts a wide range of Python callables, from plain functions and classes to
`functools.partial()` objects.

Raises `ValueError` if no signature can be provided, and `TypeError` if that
type of object is not supported.

A slash(/) in the signature of a function denotes that the parameters prior to
it are positional-only. For more info, see the FAQ entry on positional-only
parameters.

New in version 3.5: `follow_wrapped` parameter. Pass `False` to get a
signature of `callable` specifically (`callable.__wrapped__` will not be used
to unwrap decorated callables.)

Note

Some callables may not be introspectable in certain implementations of Python.
For example, in CPython, some built-in functions defined in C provide no
metadata about their arguments.

`class inspect.Signature(parameters=None, *,
return_annotation=Signature.empty)`

    
A Signature object represents the call signature of a function and its return
annotation. For each parameter accepted by the function it stores a
`Parameter` object in its `parameters` collection.

The optional parameters argument is a sequence of `Parameter` objects, which
is validated to check that there are no parameters with duplicate names, and
that the parameters are in the right order, i.e. positional-only first, then
positional-or-keyword, and that parameters with defaults follow parameters
without defaults.

The optional return_annotation argument, can be an arbitrary Python object, is
the “return” annotation of the callable.

Signature objects are immutable. Use `Signature.replace()` to make a modified
copy.

Changed in version 3.5: Signature objects are picklable and hashable.

`empty`

    
A special class-level marker to specify absence of a return annotation.

`parameters`

    
An ordered mapping of parameters’ names to the corresponding `Parameter`
objects. Parameters appear in strict definition order, including keyword-only
parameters.

Changed in version 3.7: Python only explicitly guaranteed that it preserved
the declaration order of keyword-only parameters as of version 3.7, although
in practice this order had always been preserved in Python 3.

`return_annotation`

    
The “return” annotation for the callable. If the callable has no “return”
annotation, this attribute is set to `Signature.empty`.

`bind(*args, **kwargs)`

    
Create a mapping from positional and keyword arguments to parameters. Returns
`BoundArguments` if `*args` and `**kwargs` match the signature, or raises a
`TypeError`.

`bind_partial(*args, **kwargs)`

    
Works the same way as `Signature.bind()`, but allows the omission of some
required arguments (mimics `functools.partial()` behavior.) Returns
`BoundArguments`, or raises a `TypeError` if the passed arguments do not match
the signature.

`replace(*[, parameters][, return_annotation])`

    
Create a new Signature instance based on the instance replace was invoked on.
It is possible to pass different `parameters` and/or `return_annotation` to
override the corresponding properties of the base signature. To remove
return_annotation from the copied Signature, pass in `Signature.empty`.

    
    >>> def test(a, b):
    ...     pass
    >>> sig = signature(test)
    >>> new_sig = sig.replace(return_annotation="new return anno")
    >>> str(new_sig)
    "(a, b) -> 'new return anno'"
    
`classmethod from_callable(obj, *, follow_wrapped=True)`

    
Return a `Signature` (or its subclass) object for a given callable `obj`. Pass
`follow_wrapped=False` to get a signature of `obj` without unwrapping its
`__wrapped__` chain.

This method simplifies subclassing of `Signature`:

    
    class MySignature(Signature):
        pass
    sig = MySignature.from_callable(min)
    assert isinstance(sig, MySignature)
    
New in version 3.5.

`class inspect.Parameter(name, kind, *, default=Parameter.empty,
annotation=Parameter.empty)`

    
Parameter objects are immutable. Instead of modifying a Parameter object, you
can use `Parameter.replace()` to create a modified copy.

Changed in version 3.5: Parameter objects are picklable and hashable.

`empty`

    
A special class-level marker to specify absence of default values and
annotations.

`name`

    
The name of the parameter as a string. The name must be a valid Python
identifier.

CPython implementation detail: CPython generates implicit parameter names of
the form `.0` on the code objects used to implement comprehensions and
generator expressions.

Changed in version 3.6: These parameter names are exposed by this module as
names like `implicit0`.

`default`

    
The default value for the parameter. If the parameter has no default value,
this attribute is set to `Parameter.empty`.

`annotation`

    
The annotation for the parameter. If the parameter has no annotation, this
attribute is set to `Parameter.empty`.

`kind`

    
Describes how argument values are bound to the parameter. Possible values
(accessible via `Parameter`, like `Parameter.KEYWORD_ONLY`):

Name | Meaning  
---|---  
POSITIONAL_ONLY | Value must be supplied as a positional argument. Positional only parameters are those which appear before a `/` entry (if present) in a Python function definition.  
POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD | Value may be supplied as either a keyword or positional argument (this is the standard binding behaviour for functions implemented in Python.)  
VAR_POSITIONAL | A tuple of positional arguments that aren’t bound to any other parameter. This corresponds to a `*args` parameter in a Python function definition.  
KEYWORD_ONLY | Value must be supplied as a keyword argument. Keyword only parameters are those which appear after a `*` or `*args` entry in a Python function definition.  
VAR_KEYWORD | A dict of keyword arguments that aren’t bound to any other parameter. This corresponds to a `**kwargs` parameter in a Python function definition.  
Example: print all keyword-only arguments without default values:

    
    >>> def foo(a, b, *, c, d=10):
    ...     pass
    
    >>> sig = signature(foo)
    >>> for param in sig.parameters.values():
    ...     if (param.kind == param.KEYWORD_ONLY and
    ...                        param.default is param.empty):
    ...         print('Parameter:', param)
    Parameter: c
    
`kind.description`

    
Describes a enum value of Parameter.kind.

New in version 3.8.

Example: print all descriptions of arguments:

    
    >>> def foo(a, b, *, c, d=10):
    ...     pass
    
    >>> sig = signature(foo)
    >>> for param in sig.parameters.values():
    ...     print(param.kind.description)
    positional or keyword
    positional or keyword
    keyword-only
    keyword-only
    
`replace(*[, name][, kind][, default][, annotation])`

    
Create a new Parameter instance based on the instance replaced was invoked on.
To override a `Parameter` attribute, pass the corresponding argument. To
remove a default value or/and an annotation from a Parameter, pass
`Parameter.empty`.

    
    >>> from inspect import Parameter
    >>> param = Parameter('foo', Parameter.KEYWORD_ONLY, default=42)
    >>> str(param)
    'foo=42'
    
    >>> str(param.replace()) # Will create a shallow copy of 'param'
    'foo=42'
    
    >>> str(param.replace(default=Parameter.empty, annotation='spam'))
    "foo:'spam'"
    
Changed in version 3.4: In Python 3.3 Parameter objects were allowed to have
`name` set to `None` if their `kind` was set to `POSITIONAL_ONLY`. This is no
longer permitted.

`class inspect.BoundArguments`

    
Result of a `Signature.bind()` or `Signature.bind_partial()` call. Holds the
mapping of arguments to the function’s parameters.

`arguments`

    
A mutable mapping of parameters’ names to arguments’ values. Contains only
explicitly bound arguments. Changes in `arguments` will reflect in `args` and
`kwargs`.

Should be used in conjunction with `Signature.parameters` for any argument
processing purposes.

Note

Arguments for which `Signature.bind()` or `Signature.bind_partial()` relied on
a default value are skipped. However, if needed, use
`BoundArguments.apply_defaults()` to add them.

Changed in version 3.9: `arguments` is now of type `dict`. Formerly, it was of
type `collections.OrderedDict`.

`args`

    
A tuple of positional arguments values. Dynamically computed from the
`arguments` attribute.

`kwargs`

    
A dict of keyword arguments values. Dynamically computed from the `arguments`
attribute.

`signature`

    
A reference to the parent `Signature` object.

`apply_defaults()`

    
Set default values for missing arguments.

For variable-positional arguments (`*args`) the default is an empty tuple.

For variable-keyword arguments (`**kwargs`) the default is an empty dict.

    
    >>> def foo(a, b='ham', *args): pass
    >>> ba = inspect.signature(foo).bind('spam')
    >>> ba.apply_defaults()
    >>> ba.arguments
    {'a': 'spam', 'b': 'ham', 'args': ()}
    
New in version 3.5.

The `args` and `kwargs` properties can be used to invoke functions:

    
    def test(a, *, b):
        ...
    
    sig = signature(test)
    ba = sig.bind(10, b=20)
    test(*ba.args, **ba.kwargs)

## Classes and functions

`inspect.getclasstree(classes, unique=False)`

    
Arrange the given list of classes into a hierarchy of nested lists. Where a
nested list appears, it contains classes derived from the class whose entry
immediately precedes the list. Each entry is a 2-tuple containing a class and
a tuple of its base classes. If the unique argument is true, exactly one entry
appears in the returned structure for each class in the given list. Otherwise,
classes using multiple inheritance and their descendants will appear multiple
times.

`inspect.getargspec(func)`

    
Get the names and default values of a Python function’s parameters. A named
tuple `ArgSpec(args, varargs, keywords, defaults)` is returned. args is a list
of the parameter names. varargs and keywords are the names of the `*` and `**`
parameters or `None`. defaults is a tuple of default argument values or `None`
if there are no default arguments; if this tuple has n elements, they
correspond to the last n elements listed in args.

Deprecated since version 3.0: Use `getfullargspec()` for an updated API that
is usually a drop-in replacement, but also correctly handles function
annotations and keyword-only parameters.

Alternatively, use `signature()` and Signature Object, which provide a more
structured introspection API for callables.

`inspect.getfullargspec(func)`

    
Get the names and default values of a Python function’s parameters. A named
tuple is returned:

`FullArgSpec(args, varargs, varkw, defaults, kwonlyargs, kwonlydefaults,
annotations)`

args is a list of the positional parameter names. varargs is the name of the
`*` parameter or `None` if arbitrary positional arguments are not accepted.
varkw is the name of the `**` parameter or `None` if arbitrary keyword
arguments are not accepted. defaults is an n-tuple of default argument values
corresponding to the last n positional parameters, or `None` if there are no
such defaults defined. kwonlyargs is a list of keyword-only parameter names in
declaration order. kwonlydefaults is a dictionary mapping parameter names from
kwonlyargs to the default values used if no argument is supplied. annotations
is a dictionary mapping parameter names to annotations. The special key
`"return"` is used to report the function return value annotation (if any).

Note that `signature()` and Signature Object provide the recommended API for
callable introspection, and support additional behaviours (like positional-
only arguments) that are sometimes encountered in extension module APIs. This
function is retained primarily for use in code that needs to maintain
compatibility with the Python 2 `inspect` module API.

Changed in version 3.4: This function is now based on `signature()`, but still
ignores `__wrapped__` attributes and includes the already bound first
parameter in the signature output for bound methods.

Changed in version 3.6: This method was previously documented as deprecated in
favour of `signature()` in Python 3.5, but that decision has been reversed in
order to restore a clearly supported standard interface for single-source
Python 2/3 code migrating away from the legacy `getargspec()` API.

Changed in version 3.7: Python only explicitly guaranteed that it preserved
the declaration order of keyword-only parameters as of version 3.7, although
in practice this order had always been preserved in Python 3.

`inspect.getargvalues(frame)`

    
Get information about arguments passed into a particular frame. A named tuple
`ArgInfo(args, varargs, keywords, locals)` is returned. args is a list of the
argument names. varargs and keywords are the names of the `*` and `**`
arguments or `None`. locals is the locals dictionary of the given frame.

Note

This function was inadvertently marked as deprecated in Python 3.5.

`inspect.formatargspec(args[, varargs, varkw, defaults, kwonlyargs,
kwonlydefaults, annotations[, formatarg, formatvarargs, formatvarkw,
formatvalue, formatreturns, formatannotations]])`

    
Format a pretty argument spec from the values returned by `getfullargspec()`.

The first seven arguments are (`args`, `varargs`, `varkw`, `defaults`,
`kwonlyargs`, `kwonlydefaults`, `annotations`).

The other six arguments are functions that are called to turn argument names,
`*` argument name, `**` argument name, default values, return annotation and
individual annotations into strings, respectively.

For example:

    
    >>> from inspect import formatargspec, getfullargspec
    >>> def f(a: int, b: float):
    ...     pass
    ...
    >>> formatargspec(*getfullargspec(f))
    '(a: int, b: float)'
    
Deprecated since version 3.5: Use `signature()` and Signature Object, which
provide a better introspecting API for callables.

`inspect.formatargvalues(args[, varargs, varkw, locals, formatarg,
formatvarargs, formatvarkw, formatvalue])`

    
Format a pretty argument spec from the four values returned by
`getargvalues()`. The format* arguments are the corresponding optional
formatting functions that are called to turn names and values into strings.

Note

This function was inadvertently marked as deprecated in Python 3.5.

`inspect.getmro(cls)`

    
Return a tuple of class cls’s base classes, including cls, in method
resolution order. No class appears more than once in this tuple. Note that the
method resolution order depends on cls’s type. Unless a very peculiar user-
defined metatype is in use, cls will be the first element of the tuple.

`inspect.getcallargs(func, /, *args, **kwds)`

    
Bind the args and kwds to the argument names of the Python function or method
func, as if it was called with them. For bound methods, bind also the first
argument (typically named `self`) to the associated instance. A dict is
returned, mapping the argument names (including the names of the `*` and `**`
arguments, if any) to their values from args and kwds. In case of invoking
func incorrectly, i.e. whenever `func(*args, **kwds)` would raise an exception
because of incompatible signature, an exception of the same type and the same
or similar message is raised. For example:

    
    >>> from inspect import getcallargs
    >>> def f(a, b=1, *pos, **named):
    ...     pass
    >>> getcallargs(f, 1, 2, 3) == {'a': 1, 'named': {}, 'b': 2, 'pos': (3,)}
    True
    >>> getcallargs(f, a=2, x=4) == {'a': 2, 'named': {'x': 4}, 'b': 1, 'pos': ()}
    True
    >>> getcallargs(f)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: f() missing 1 required positional argument: 'a'
    
New in version 3.2.

Deprecated since version 3.5: Use `Signature.bind()` and
`Signature.bind_partial()` instead.

`inspect.getclosurevars(func)`

    
Get the mapping of external name references in a Python function or method
func to their current values. A named tuple `ClosureVars(nonlocals, globals,
builtins, unbound)` is returned. nonlocals maps referenced names to lexical
closure variables, globals to the function’s module globals and builtins to
the builtins visible from the function body. unbound is the set of names
referenced in the function that could not be resolved at all given the current
module globals and builtins.

`TypeError` is raised if func is not a Python function or method.

New in version 3.3.

`inspect.unwrap(func, *, stop=None)`

    
Get the object wrapped by func. It follows the chain of `__wrapped__`
attributes returning the last object in the chain.

stop is an optional callback accepting an object in the wrapper chain as its
sole argument that allows the unwrapping to be terminated early if the
callback returns a true value. If the callback never returns a true value, the
last object in the chain is returned as usual. For example, `signature()` uses
this to stop unwrapping if any object in the chain has a `__signature__`
attribute defined.

`ValueError` is raised if a cycle is encountered.

New in version 3.4.

## The interpreter stack

When the following functions return “frame records,” each record is a named
tuple `FrameInfo(frame, filename, lineno, function, code_context, index)`. The
tuple contains the frame object, the filename, the line number of the current
line, the function name, a list of lines of context from the source code, and
the index of the current line within that list.

Changed in version 3.5: Return a named tuple instead of a tuple.

Note

Keeping references to frame objects, as found in the first element of the
frame records these functions return, can cause your program to create
reference cycles. Once a reference cycle has been created, the lifespan of all
objects which can be accessed from the objects which form the cycle can become
much longer even if Python’s optional cycle detector is enabled. If such
cycles must be created, it is important to ensure they are explicitly broken
to avoid the delayed destruction of objects and increased memory consumption
which occurs.

Though the cycle detector will catch these, destruction of the frames (and
local variables) can be made deterministic by removing the cycle in a
`finally` clause. This is also important if the cycle detector was disabled
when Python was compiled or using `gc.disable()`. For example:

    
    def handle_stackframe_without_leak():
        frame = inspect.currentframe()
        try:
            # do something with the frame
        finally:
            del frame
    
If you want to keep the frame around (for example to print a traceback later),
you can also break reference cycles by using the `frame.clear()` method.

The optional context argument supported by most of these functions specifies
the number of lines of context to return, which are centered around the
current line.

`inspect.getframeinfo(frame, context=1)`

    
Get information about a frame or traceback object. A named tuple
`Traceback(filename, lineno, function, code_context, index)` is returned.

`inspect.getouterframes(frame, context=1)`

    
Get a list of frame records for a frame and all outer frames. These frames
represent the calls that lead to the creation of frame. The first entry in the
returned list represents frame; the last entry represents the outermost call
on frame’s stack.

Changed in version 3.5: A list of named tuples `FrameInfo(frame, filename,
lineno, function, code_context, index)` is returned.

`inspect.getinnerframes(traceback, context=1)`

    
Get a list of frame records for a traceback’s frame and all inner frames.
These frames represent calls made as a consequence of frame. The first entry
in the list represents traceback; the last entry represents where the
exception was raised.

Changed in version 3.5: A list of named tuples `FrameInfo(frame, filename,
lineno, function, code_context, index)` is returned.

`inspect.currentframe()`

    
Return the frame object for the caller’s stack frame.

CPython implementation detail: This function relies on Python stack frame
support in the interpreter, which isn’t guaranteed to exist in all
implementations of Python. If running in an implementation without Python
stack frame support this function returns `None`.

`inspect.stack(context=1)`

    
Return a list of frame records for the caller’s stack. The first entry in the
returned list represents the caller; the last entry represents the outermost
call on the stack.

Changed in version 3.5: A list of named tuples `FrameInfo(frame, filename,
lineno, function, code_context, index)` is returned.

`inspect.trace(context=1)`

    
Return a list of frame records for the stack between the current frame and the
frame in which an exception currently being handled was raised in. The first
entry in the list represents the caller; the last entry represents where the
exception was raised.

Changed in version 3.5: A list of named tuples `FrameInfo(frame, filename,
lineno, function, code_context, index)` is returned.

## Fetching attributes statically

Both `getattr()` and `hasattr()` can trigger code execution when fetching or
checking for the existence of attributes. Descriptors, like properties, will
be invoked and `__getattr__()` and `__getattribute__()` may be called.

For cases where you want passive introspection, like documentation tools, this
can be inconvenient. `getattr_static()` has the same signature as `getattr()`
but avoids executing code when it fetches attributes.

`inspect.getattr_static(obj, attr, default=None)`

    
Retrieve attributes without triggering dynamic lookup via the descriptor
protocol, `__getattr__()` or `__getattribute__()`.

Note: this function may not be able to retrieve all attributes that getattr
can fetch (like dynamically created attributes) and may find attributes that
getattr can’t (like descriptors that raise AttributeError). It can also return
descriptors objects instead of instance members.

If the instance `__dict__` is shadowed by another member (for example a
property) then this function will be unable to find instance members.

New in version 3.2.

`getattr_static()` does not resolve descriptors, for example slot descriptors
or getset descriptors on objects implemented in C. The descriptor object is
returned instead of the underlying attribute.

You can handle these with code like the following. Note that for arbitrary
getset descriptors invoking these may trigger code execution:

    
    # example code for resolving the builtin descriptor types
    class _foo:
        __slots__ = ['foo']
    
    slot_descriptor = type(_foo.foo)
    getset_descriptor = type(type(open(__file__)).name)
    wrapper_descriptor = type(str.__dict__['__add__'])
    descriptor_types = (slot_descriptor, getset_descriptor, wrapper_descriptor)
    
    result = getattr_static(some_object, 'foo')
    if type(result) in descriptor_types:
        try:
            result = result.__get__()
        except AttributeError:
            # descriptors can raise AttributeError to
            # indicate there is no underlying value
            # in which case the descriptor itself will
            # have to do
            pass
    
## Current State of Generators and Coroutines

When implementing coroutine schedulers and for other advanced uses of
generators, it is useful to determine whether a generator is currently
executing, is waiting to start or resume or execution, or has already
terminated. `getgeneratorstate()` allows the current state of a generator to
be determined easily.

`inspect.getgeneratorstate(generator)`

    
Get current state of a generator-iterator.

Possible states are:

    
  * GEN_CREATED: Waiting to start execution.
  * GEN_RUNNING: Currently being executed by the interpreter.
  * GEN_SUSPENDED: Currently suspended at a yield expression.
  * GEN_CLOSED: Execution has completed.

New in version 3.2.

`inspect.getcoroutinestate(coroutine)`

    
Get current state of a coroutine object. The function is intended to be used
with coroutine objects created by `async def` functions, but will accept any
coroutine-like object that has `cr_running` and `cr_frame` attributes.

Possible states are:

    
  * CORO_CREATED: Waiting to start execution.
  * CORO_RUNNING: Currently being executed by the interpreter.
  * CORO_SUSPENDED: Currently suspended at an await expression.
  * CORO_CLOSED: Execution has completed.

New in version 3.5.

The current internal state of the generator can also be queried. This is
mostly useful for testing purposes, to ensure that internal state is being
updated as expected:

`inspect.getgeneratorlocals(generator)`

    
Get the mapping of live local variables in generator to their current values.
A dictionary is returned that maps from variable names to values. This is the
equivalent of calling `locals()` in the body of the generator, and all the
same caveats apply.

If generator is a generator with no currently associated frame, then an empty
dictionary is returned. `TypeError` is raised if generator is not a Python
generator object.

CPython implementation detail: This function relies on the generator exposing
a Python stack frame for introspection, which isn’t guaranteed to be the case
in all implementations of Python. In such cases, this function will always
return an empty dictionary.

New in version 3.3.

`inspect.getcoroutinelocals(coroutine)`

    
This function is analogous to `getgeneratorlocals()`, but works for coroutine
objects created by `async def` functions.

New in version 3.5.

## Code Objects Bit Flags

Python code objects have a `co_flags` attribute, which is a bitmap of the
following flags:

`inspect.CO_OPTIMIZED`

    
The code object is optimized, using fast locals.

`inspect.CO_NEWLOCALS`

    
If set, a new dict will be created for the frame’s `f_locals` when the code
object is executed.

`inspect.CO_VARARGS`

    
The code object has a variable positional parameter (`*args`-like).

`inspect.CO_VARKEYWORDS`

    
The code object has a variable keyword parameter (`**kwargs`-like).

`inspect.CO_NESTED`

    
The flag is set when the code object is a nested function.

`inspect.CO_GENERATOR`

    
The flag is set when the code object is a generator function, i.e. a generator
object is returned when the code object is executed.

`inspect.CO_NOFREE`

    
The flag is set if there are no free or cell variables.

`inspect.CO_COROUTINE`

    
The flag is set when the code object is a coroutine function. When the code
object is executed it returns a coroutine object. See PEP 492 for more
details.

New in version 3.5.

`inspect.CO_ITERABLE_COROUTINE`

    
The flag is used to transform generators into generator-based coroutines.
Generator objects with this flag can be used in `await` expression, and can
`yield from` coroutine objects. See PEP 492 for more details.

New in version 3.5.

`inspect.CO_ASYNC_GENERATOR`

    
The flag is set when the code object is an asynchronous generator function.
When the code object is executed it returns an asynchronous generator object.
See PEP 525 for more details.

New in version 3.6.

Note

The flags are specific to CPython, and may not be defined in other Python
implementations. Furthermore, the flags are an implementation detail, and can
be removed or deprecated in future Python releases. It’s recommended to use
public APIs from the `inspect` module for any introspection needs.

## Command Line Interface

The `inspect` module also provides a basic introspection capability from the
command line.

By default, accepts the name of a module and prints the source of that module.
A class or function within the module can be printed instead by appended a
colon and the qualified name of the target object.

`--details`

    
Print information about the specified object rather than the source code
