# shelve — Python object persistence

Source code: Lib/shelve.py

A “shelf” is a persistent, dictionary-like object. The difference with “dbm”
databases is that the values (not the keys!) in a shelf can be essentially
arbitrary Python objects — anything that the `pickle` module can handle. This
includes most class instances, recursive data types, and objects containing
lots of shared sub-objects. The keys are ordinary strings.

`shelve.open(filename, flag='c', protocol=None, writeback=False)`

    
Open a persistent dictionary. The filename specified is the base filename for
the underlying database. As a side-effect, an extension may be added to the
filename and more than one file may be created. By default, the underlying
database file is opened for reading and writing. The optional flag parameter
has the same interpretation as the flag parameter of `dbm.open()`.

By default, version 3 pickles are used to serialize values. The version of the
pickle protocol can be specified with the protocol parameter.

Because of Python semantics, a shelf cannot know when a mutable persistent-
dictionary entry is modified. By default modified objects are written only
when assigned to the shelf (see Example). If the optional writeback parameter
is set to `True`, all entries accessed are also cached in memory, and written
back on `sync()` and `close()`; this can make it handier to mutate mutable
entries in the persistent dictionary, but, if many entries are accessed, it
can consume vast amounts of memory for the cache, and it can make the close
operation very slow since all accessed entries are written back (there is no
way to determine which accessed entries are mutable, nor which ones were
actually mutated).

Note

Do not rely on the shelf being closed automatically; always call `close()`
explicitly when you don’t need it any more, or use `shelve.open()` as a
context manager:

    
    with shelve.open('spam') as db:
        db['eggs'] = 'eggs'
    
Warning

Because the `shelve` module is backed by `pickle`, it is insecure to load a
shelf from an untrusted source. Like with pickle, loading a shelf can execute
arbitrary code.

Shelf objects support all methods supported by dictionaries. This eases the
transition from dictionary based scripts to those requiring persistent
storage.

Two additional methods are supported:

`Shelf.sync()`

    
Write back all entries in the cache if the shelf was opened with writeback set
to `True`. Also empty the cache and synchronize the persistent dictionary on
disk, if feasible. This is called automatically when the shelf is closed with
`close()`.

`Shelf.close()`

    
Synchronize and close the persistent dict object. Operations on a closed shelf
will fail with a `ValueError`.

## Restrictions

  * The choice of which database package will be used (such as `dbm.ndbm` or `dbm.gnu`) depends on which interface is available. Therefore it is not safe to open the database directly using `dbm`. The database is also (unfortunately) subject to the limitations of `dbm`, if it is used — this means that (the pickled representation of) the objects stored in the database should be fairly small, and in rare cases key collisions may cause the database to refuse updates.
  * The `shelve` module does not support concurrent read/write access to shelved objects. (Multiple simultaneous read accesses are safe.) When a program has a shelf open for writing, no other program should have it open for reading or writing. Unix file locking can be used to solve this, but this differs across Unix versions and requires knowledge about the database implementation used.

`class shelve.Shelf(dict, protocol=None, writeback=False,
keyencoding='utf-8')`

    
A subclass of `collections.abc.MutableMapping` which stores pickled values in
the dict object.

By default, version 3 pickles are used to serialize values. The version of the
pickle protocol can be specified with the protocol parameter. See the `pickle`
documentation for a discussion of the pickle protocols.

If the writeback parameter is `True`, the object will hold a cache of all
entries accessed and write them back to the dict at sync and close times. This
allows natural operations on mutable entries, but can consume much more memory
and make sync and close take a long time.

The keyencoding parameter is the encoding used to encode keys before they are
used with the underlying dict.

A `Shelf` object can also be used as a context manager, in which case it will
be automatically closed when the `with` block ends.

Changed in version 3.2: Added the keyencoding parameter; previously, keys were
always encoded in UTF-8.

Changed in version 3.4: Added context manager support.

`class shelve.BsdDbShelf(dict, protocol=None, writeback=False,
keyencoding='utf-8')`

    
A subclass of `Shelf` which exposes `first()`, `next()`, `previous()`,
`last()` and `set_location()` which are available in the third-party `bsddb`
module from pybsddb but not in other database modules. The dict object passed
to the constructor must support those methods. This is generally accomplished
by calling one of `bsddb.hashopen()`, `bsddb.btopen()` or `bsddb.rnopen()`.
The optional protocol, writeback, and keyencoding parameters have the same
interpretation as for the `Shelf` class.

`class shelve.DbfilenameShelf(filename, flag='c', protocol=None,
writeback=False)`

    
A subclass of `Shelf` which accepts a filename instead of a dict-like object.
The underlying file will be opened using `dbm.open()`. By default, the file
will be created and opened for both read and write. The optional flag
parameter has the same interpretation as for the `open()` function. The
optional protocol and writeback parameters have the same interpretation as for
the `Shelf` class.

## Example

To summarize the interface (`key` is a string, `data` is an arbitrary object):

    
    import shelve
    
    d = shelve.open(filename)  # open -- file may get suffix added by low-level
                               # library
    
    d[key] = data              # store data at key (overwrites old data if
                               # using an existing key)
    data = d[key]              # retrieve a COPY of data at key (raise KeyError
                               # if no such key)
    del d[key]                 # delete data stored at key (raises KeyError
                               # if no such key)
    
    flag = key in d            # true if the key exists
    klist = list(d.keys())     # a list of all existing keys (slow!)
    
    # as d was opened WITHOUT writeback=True, beware:
    d['xx'] = [0, 1, 2]        # this works as expected, but...
    d['xx'].append(3)          # *this doesn't!* -- d['xx'] is STILL [0, 1, 2]!
    
    # having opened d without writeback=True, you need to code carefully:
    temp = d['xx']             # extracts the copy
    temp.append(5)             # mutates the copy
    d['xx'] = temp             # stores the copy right back, to persist it
    
    # or, d=shelve.open(filename,writeback=True) would let you just code
    # d['xx'].append(5) and have it work as expected, BUT it would also
    # consume more memory and make the d.close() operation slower.
    
    d.close()                  # close it
