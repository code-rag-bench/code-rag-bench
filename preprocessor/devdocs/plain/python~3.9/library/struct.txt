# struct — Interpret bytes as packed binary data

Source code: Lib/struct.py

This module performs conversions between Python values and C structs
represented as Python `bytes` objects. This can be used in handling binary
data stored in files or from network connections, among other sources. It uses
Format Strings as compact descriptions of the layout of the C structs and the
intended conversion to/from Python values.

Note

By default, the result of packing a given C struct includes pad bytes in order
to maintain proper alignment for the C types involved; similarly, alignment is
taken into account when unpacking. This behavior is chosen so that the bytes
of a packed struct correspond exactly to the layout in memory of the
corresponding C struct. To handle platform-independent data formats or omit
implicit pad bytes, use `standard` size and alignment instead of `native` size
and alignment: see Byte Order, Size, and Alignment for details.

Several `struct` functions (and methods of `Struct`) take a buffer argument.
This refers to objects that implement the Buffer Protocol and provide either a
readable or read-writable buffer. The most common types used for that purpose
are `bytes` and `bytearray`, but many other types that can be viewed as an
array of bytes implement the buffer protocol, so that they can be read/filled
without additional copying from a `bytes` object.

## Functions and Exceptions

The module defines the following exception and functions:

`exception struct.error`

    
Exception raised on various occasions; argument is a string describing what is
wrong.

`struct.pack(format, v1, v2, ...)`

    
Return a bytes object containing the values v1, v2, … packed according to the
format string format. The arguments must match the values required by the
format exactly.

`struct.pack_into(format, buffer, offset, v1, v2, ...)`

    
Pack the values v1, v2, … according to the format string format and write the
packed bytes into the writable buffer buffer starting at position offset. Note
that offset is a required argument.

`struct.unpack(format, buffer)`

    
Unpack from the buffer buffer (presumably packed by `pack(format, ...)`)
according to the format string format. The result is a tuple even if it
contains exactly one item. The buffer’s size in bytes must match the size
required by the format, as reflected by `calcsize()`.

`struct.unpack_from(format, /, buffer, offset=0)`

    
Unpack from buffer starting at position offset, according to the format string
format. The result is a tuple even if it contains exactly one item. The
buffer’s size in bytes, starting at position offset, must be at least the size
required by the format, as reflected by `calcsize()`.

`struct.iter_unpack(format, buffer)`

    
Iteratively unpack from the buffer buffer according to the format string
format. This function returns an iterator which will read equally-sized chunks
from the buffer until all its contents have been consumed. The buffer’s size
in bytes must be a multiple of the size required by the format, as reflected
by `calcsize()`.

Each iteration yields a tuple as specified by the format string.

New in version 3.4.

`struct.calcsize(format)`

    
Return the size of the struct (and hence of the bytes object produced by
`pack(format, ...)`) corresponding to the format string format.

## Format Strings

Format strings are the mechanism used to specify the expected layout when
packing and unpacking data. They are built up from Format Characters, which
specify the type of data being packed/unpacked. In addition, there are special
characters for controlling the Byte Order, Size, and Alignment.

### Byte Order, Size, and Alignment

By default, C types are represented in the machine’s native format and byte
order, and properly aligned by skipping pad bytes if necessary (according to
the rules used by the C compiler).

Alternatively, the first character of the format string can be used to
indicate the byte order, size and alignment of the packed data, according to
the following table:

Character | Byte order | Size | Alignment  
---|---|---|---  
`@` | native | native | native  
`=` | native | standard | none  
`<` | little-endian | standard | none  
`>` | big-endian | standard | none  
`!` | network (= big-endian) | standard | none  
If the first character is not one of these, `'@'` is assumed.

Native byte order is big-endian or little-endian, depending on the host
system. For example, Intel x86 and AMD64 (x86-64) are little-endian; Motorola
68000 and PowerPC G5 are big-endian; ARM and Intel Itanium feature switchable
endianness (bi-endian). Use `sys.byteorder` to check the endianness of your
system.

Native size and alignment are determined using the C compiler’s `sizeof`
expression. This is always combined with native byte order.

Standard size depends only on the format character; see the table in the
Format Characters section.

Note the difference between `'@'` and `'='`: both use native byte order, but
the size and alignment of the latter is standardized.

The form `'!'` represents the network byte order which is always big-endian as
defined in IETF RFC 1700.

There is no way to indicate non-native byte order (force byte-swapping); use
the appropriate choice of `'<'` or `'>'`.

Notes:

  1. Padding is only automatically added between successive structure members. No padding is added at the beginning or the end of the encoded struct.
  2. No padding is added when using non-native size and alignment, e.g. with ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘=’, and ‘!’.
  3. To align the end of a structure to the alignment requirement of a particular type, end the format with the code for that type with a repeat count of zero. See Examples.

### Format Characters

Format characters have the following meaning; the conversion between C and
Python values should be obvious given their types. The ‘Standard size’ column
refers to the size of the packed value in bytes when using standard size; that
is, when the format string starts with one of `'<'`, `'>'`, `'!'` or `'='`.
When using native size, the size of the packed value is platform-dependent.

Format | C Type | Python type | Standard size | Notes  
---|---|---|---|---  
`x` | pad byte | no value |  |   
`c` | `char` | bytes of length 1 | 1 |   
`b` | `signed char` | integer | 1 | (1), (2)  
`B` | `unsigned char` | integer | 1 | (2)  
`?` | `_Bool` | bool | 1 | (1)  
`h` | `short` | integer | 2 | (2)  
`H` | `unsigned short` | integer | 2 | (2)  
`i` | `int` | integer | 4 | (2)  
`I` | `unsigned int` | integer | 4 | (2)  
`l` | `long` | integer | 4 | (2)  
`L` | `unsigned long` | integer | 4 | (2)  
`q` | `long long` | integer | 8 | (2)  
`Q` | `unsigned long long` | integer | 8 | (2)  
`n` | `ssize_t` | integer |  | (3)  
`N` | `size_t` | integer |  | (3)  
`e` | (6) | float | 2 | (4)  
`f` | `float` | float | 4 | (4)  
`d` | `double` | float | 8 | (4)  
`s` | `char[]` | bytes |  |   
`p` | `char[]` | bytes |  |   
`P` | `void *` | integer |  | (5)  
Changed in version 3.3: Added support for the `'n'` and `'N'` formats.

Changed in version 3.6: Added support for the `'e'` format.

Notes:

  1. The `'?'` conversion code corresponds to the `_Bool` type defined by C99. If this type is not available, it is simulated using a `char`. In standard mode, it is always represented by one byte. 
  2. When attempting to pack a non-integer using any of the integer conversion codes, if the non-integer has a `__index__()` method then that method is called to convert the argument to an integer before packing.
Changed in version 3.2: Added use of the `__index__()` method for non-
integers.

  3. The `'n'` and `'N'` conversion codes are only available for the native size (selected as the default or with the `'@'` byte order character). For the standard size, you can use whichever of the other integer formats fits your application.
  4. For the `'f'`, `'d'` and `'e'` conversion codes, the packed representation uses the IEEE 754 binary32, binary64 or binary16 format (for `'f'`, `'d'` or `'e'` respectively), regardless of the floating-point format used by the platform.
  5. The `'P'` format character is only available for the native byte ordering (selected as the default or with the `'@'` byte order character). The byte order character `'='` chooses to use little- or big-endian ordering based on the host system. The struct module does not interpret this as native ordering, so the `'P'` format is not available.
  6. The IEEE 754 binary16 “half precision” type was introduced in the 2008 revision of the IEEE 754 standard. It has a sign bit, a 5-bit exponent and 11-bit precision (with 10 bits explicitly stored), and can represent numbers between approximately `6.1e-05` and `6.5e+04` at full precision. This type is not widely supported by C compilers: on a typical machine, an unsigned short can be used for storage, but not for math operations. See the Wikipedia page on the half-precision floating-point format for more information.

A format character may be preceded by an integral repeat count. For example,
the format string `'4h'` means exactly the same as `'hhhh'`.

Whitespace characters between formats are ignored; a count and its format must
not contain whitespace though.

For the `'s'` format character, the count is interpreted as the length of the
bytes, not a repeat count like for the other format characters; for example,
`'10s'` means a single 10-byte string, while `'10c'` means 10 characters. If a
count is not given, it defaults to 1. For packing, the string is truncated or
padded with null bytes as appropriate to make it fit. For unpacking, the
resulting bytes object always has exactly the specified number of bytes. As a
special case, `'0s'` means a single, empty string (while `'0c'` means 0
characters).

When packing a value `x` using one of the integer formats (`'b'`, `'B'`,
`'h'`, `'H'`, `'i'`, `'I'`, `'l'`, `'L'`, `'q'`, `'Q'`), if `x` is outside the
valid range for that format then `struct.error` is raised.

Changed in version 3.1: Previously, some of the integer formats wrapped out-
of-range values and raised `DeprecationWarning` instead of `struct.error`.

The `'p'` format character encodes a “Pascal string”, meaning a short
variable-length string stored in a fixed number of bytes, given by the count.
The first byte stored is the length of the string, or 255, whichever is
smaller. The bytes of the string follow. If the string passed in to `pack()`
is too long (longer than the count minus 1), only the leading `count-1` bytes
of the string are stored. If the string is shorter than `count-1`, it is
padded with null bytes so that exactly count bytes in all are used. Note that
for `unpack()`, the `'p'` format character consumes `count` bytes, but that
the string returned can never contain more than 255 bytes.

For the `'?'` format character, the return value is either `True` or `False`.
When packing, the truth value of the argument object is used. Either 0 or 1 in
the native or standard bool representation will be packed, and any non-zero
value will be `True` when unpacking.

### Examples

Note

All examples assume a native byte order, size, and alignment with a big-endian
machine.

A basic example of packing/unpacking three integers:

    
    >>> from struct import *
    >>> pack('hhl', 1, 2, 3)
    b'\x00\x01\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03'
    >>> unpack('hhl', b'\x00\x01\x00\x02\x00\x00\x00\x03')
    (1, 2, 3)
    >>> calcsize('hhl')
    8
    
Unpacked fields can be named by assigning them to variables or by wrapping the
result in a named tuple:

    
    >>> record = b'raymond   \x32\x12\x08\x01\x08'
    >>> name, serialnum, school, gradelevel = unpack('<10sHHb', record)
    
    >>> from collections import namedtuple
    >>> Student = namedtuple('Student', 'name serialnum school gradelevel')
    >>> Student._make(unpack('<10sHHb', record))
    Student(name=b'raymond   ', serialnum=4658, school=264, gradelevel=8)
    
The ordering of format characters may have an impact on size since the padding
needed to satisfy alignment requirements is different:

    
    >>> pack('ci', b'*', 0x12131415)
    b'*\x00\x00\x00\x12\x13\x14\x15'
    >>> pack('ic', 0x12131415, b'*')
    b'\x12\x13\x14\x15*'
    >>> calcsize('ci')
    8
    >>> calcsize('ic')
    5
    
The following format `'llh0l'` specifies two pad bytes at the end, assuming
longs are aligned on 4-byte boundaries:

    
    >>> pack('llh0l', 1, 2, 3)
    b'\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x03\x00\x00'
    
This only works when native size and alignment are in effect; standard size
and alignment does not enforce any alignment.

## Classes

The `struct` module also defines the following type:

`class struct.Struct(format)`

    
Return a new Struct object which writes and reads binary data according to the
format string format. Creating a Struct object once and calling its methods is
more efficient than calling the `struct` functions with the same format since
the format string only needs to be compiled once.

Note

The compiled versions of the most recent format strings passed to `Struct` and
the module-level functions are cached, so programs that use only a few format
strings needn’t worry about reusing a single `Struct` instance.

Compiled Struct objects support the following methods and attributes:

`pack(v1, v2, ...)`

    
Identical to the `pack()` function, using the compiled format. (`len(result)`
will equal `size`.)

`pack_into(buffer, offset, v1, v2, ...)`

    
Identical to the `pack_into()` function, using the compiled format.

`unpack(buffer)`

    
Identical to the `unpack()` function, using the compiled format. The buffer’s
size in bytes must equal `size`.

`unpack_from(buffer, offset=0)`

    
Identical to the `unpack_from()` function, using the compiled format. The
buffer’s size in bytes, starting at position offset, must be at least `size`.

`iter_unpack(buffer)`

    
Identical to the `iter_unpack()` function, using the compiled format. The
buffer’s size in bytes must be a multiple of `size`.

New in version 3.4.

`format`

    
The format string used to construct this Struct object.

Changed in version 3.7: The format string type is now `str` instead of
`bytes`.

`size`

    
The calculated size of the struct (and hence of the bytes object produced by
the `pack()` method) corresponding to `format`.
