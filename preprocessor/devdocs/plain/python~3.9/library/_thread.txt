# _thread — Low-level threading API

This module provides low-level primitives for working with multiple threads
(also called light-weight processes or tasks) — multiple threads of control
sharing their global data space. For synchronization, simple locks (also
called mutexes or binary semaphores) are provided. The `threading` module
provides an easier to use and higher-level threading API built on top of this
module.

Changed in version 3.7: This module used to be optional, it is now always
available.

This module defines the following constants and functions:

`exception _thread.error`

    
Raised on thread-specific errors.

Changed in version 3.3: This is now a synonym of the built-in `RuntimeError`.

`_thread.LockType`

    
This is the type of lock objects.

`_thread.start_new_thread(function, args[, kwargs])`

    
Start a new thread and return its identifier. The thread executes the function
function with the argument list args (which must be a tuple). The optional
kwargs argument specifies a dictionary of keyword arguments.

When the function returns, the thread silently exits.

When the function terminates with an unhandled exception,
`sys.unraisablehook()` is called to handle the exception. The object attribute
of the hook argument is function. By default, a stack trace is printed and
then the thread exits (but other threads continue to run).

When the function raises a `SystemExit` exception, it is silently ignored.

Changed in version 3.8: `sys.unraisablehook()` is now used to handle unhandled
exceptions.

`_thread.interrupt_main()`

    
Simulate the effect of a `signal.SIGINT` signal arriving in the main thread. A
thread can use this function to interrupt the main thread.

If `signal.SIGINT` isn’t handled by Python (it was set to `signal.SIG_DFL` or
`signal.SIG_IGN`), this function does nothing.

`_thread.exit()`

    
Raise the `SystemExit` exception. When not caught, this will cause the thread
to exit silently.

`_thread.allocate_lock()`

    
Return a new lock object. Methods of locks are described below. The lock is
initially unlocked.

`_thread.get_ident()`

    
Return the ‘thread identifier’ of the current thread. This is a nonzero
integer. Its value has no direct meaning; it is intended as a magic cookie to
be used e.g. to index a dictionary of thread-specific data. Thread identifiers
may be recycled when a thread exits and another thread is created.

`_thread.get_native_id()`

    
Return the native integral Thread ID of the current thread assigned by the
kernel. This is a non-negative integer. Its value may be used to uniquely
identify this particular thread system-wide (until the thread terminates,
after which the value may be recycled by the OS).

Availability: Windows, FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, OpenBSD, NetBSD, AIX.

New in version 3.8.

`_thread.stack_size([size])`

    
Return the thread stack size used when creating new threads. The optional size
argument specifies the stack size to be used for subsequently created threads,
and must be 0 (use platform or configured default) or a positive integer value
of at least 32,768 (32 KiB). If size is not specified, 0 is used. If changing
the thread stack size is unsupported, a `RuntimeError` is raised. If the
specified stack size is invalid, a `ValueError` is raised and the stack size
is unmodified. 32 KiB is currently the minimum supported stack size value to
guarantee sufficient stack space for the interpreter itself. Note that some
platforms may have particular restrictions on values for the stack size, such
as requiring a minimum stack size > 32 KiB or requiring allocation in
multiples of the system memory page size - platform documentation should be
referred to for more information (4 KiB pages are common; using multiples of
4096 for the stack size is the suggested approach in the absence of more
specific information).

Availability: Windows, systems with POSIX threads.

`_thread.TIMEOUT_MAX`

    
The maximum value allowed for the timeout parameter of `Lock.acquire()`.
Specifying a timeout greater than this value will raise an `OverflowError`.

New in version 3.2.

Lock objects have the following methods:

`lock.acquire(waitflag=1, timeout=-1)`

    
Without any optional argument, this method acquires the lock unconditionally,
if necessary waiting until it is released by another thread (only one thread
at a time can acquire a lock — that’s their reason for existence).

If the integer waitflag argument is present, the action depends on its value:
if it is zero, the lock is only acquired if it can be acquired immediately
without waiting, while if it is nonzero, the lock is acquired unconditionally
as above.

If the floating-point timeout argument is present and positive, it specifies
the maximum wait time in seconds before returning. A negative timeout argument
specifies an unbounded wait. You cannot specify a timeout if waitflag is zero.

The return value is `True` if the lock is acquired successfully, `False` if
not.

Changed in version 3.2: The timeout parameter is new.

Changed in version 3.2: Lock acquires can now be interrupted by signals on
POSIX.

`lock.release()`

    
Releases the lock. The lock must have been acquired earlier, but not
necessarily by the same thread.

`lock.locked()`

    
Return the status of the lock: `True` if it has been acquired by some thread,
`False` if not.

In addition to these methods, lock objects can also be used via the `with`
statement, e.g.:

    
    import _thread
    
    a_lock = _thread.allocate_lock()
    
    with a_lock:
        print("a_lock is locked while this executes")
    
Caveats:

  * Threads interact strangely with interrupts: the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception will be received by an arbitrary thread. (When the `signal` module is available, interrupts always go to the main thread.)
  * Calling `sys.exit()` or raising the `SystemExit` exception is equivalent to calling `_thread.exit()`.
  * It is not possible to interrupt the `acquire()` method on a lock — the `KeyboardInterrupt` exception will happen after the lock has been acquired.
  * When the main thread exits, it is system defined whether the other threads survive. On most systems, they are killed without executing `try` … `finally` clauses or executing object destructors.
  * When the main thread exits, it does not do any of its usual cleanup (except that `try` … `finally` clauses are honored), and the standard I/O files are not flushed.
