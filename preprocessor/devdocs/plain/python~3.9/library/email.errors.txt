# email.errors: Exception and Defect classes

Source code: Lib/email/errors.py

The following exception classes are defined in the `email.errors` module:

`exception email.errors.MessageError`

    
This is the base class for all exceptions that the `email` package can raise.
It is derived from the standard `Exception` class and defines no additional
methods.

`exception email.errors.MessageParseError`

    
This is the base class for exceptions raised by the `Parser` class. It is
derived from `MessageError`. This class is also used internally by the parser
used by `headerregistry`.

`exception email.errors.HeaderParseError`

    
Raised under some error conditions when parsing the RFC 5322 headers of a
message, this class is derived from `MessageParseError`. The `set_boundary()`
method will raise this error if the content type is unknown when the method is
called. `Header` may raise this error for certain base64 decoding errors, and
when an attempt is made to create a header that appears to contain an embedded
header (that is, there is what is supposed to be a continuation line that has
no leading whitespace and looks like a header).

`exception email.errors.BoundaryError`

    
Deprecated and no longer used.

`exception email.errors.MultipartConversionError`

    
Raised when a payload is added to a `Message` object using `add_payload()`,
but the payload is already a scalar and the message’s Content-Type main type
is not either multipart or missing. `MultipartConversionError` multiply
inherits from `MessageError` and the built-in `TypeError`.

Since `Message.add_payload()` is deprecated, this exception is rarely raised
in practice. However the exception may also be raised if the `attach()` method
is called on an instance of a class derived from `MIMENonMultipart` (e.g.
`MIMEImage`).

Here is the list of the defects that the `FeedParser` can find while parsing
messages. Note that the defects are added to the message where the problem was
found, so for example, if a message nested inside a multipart/alternative had
a malformed header, that nested message object would have a defect, but the
containing messages would not.

All defect classes are subclassed from `email.errors.MessageDefect`.

  * `NoBoundaryInMultipartDefect` – A message claimed to be a multipart, but had no boundary parameter.
  * `StartBoundaryNotFoundDefect` – The start boundary claimed in the Content-Type header was never found.
  * `CloseBoundaryNotFoundDefect` – A start boundary was found, but no corresponding close boundary was ever found.
New in version 3.3.

  * `FirstHeaderLineIsContinuationDefect` – The message had a continuation line as its first header line.
  * `MisplacedEnvelopeHeaderDefect` \- A “Unix From” header was found in the middle of a header block.
  * `MissingHeaderBodySeparatorDefect` \- A line was found while parsing headers that had no leading white space but contained no ‘:’. Parsing continues assuming that the line represents the first line of the body.
New in version 3.3.

  * `MalformedHeaderDefect` – A header was found that was missing a colon, or was otherwise malformed.
Deprecated since version 3.3: This defect has not been used for several Python
versions.

  * `MultipartInvariantViolationDefect` – A message claimed to be a multipart, but no subparts were found. Note that when a message has this defect, its `is_multipart()` method may return `False` even though its content type claims to be multipart.
  * `InvalidBase64PaddingDefect` – When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, the padding was not correct. Enough padding is added to perform the decode, but the resulting decoded bytes may be invalid.
  * `InvalidBase64CharactersDefect` – When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, characters outside the base64 alphabet were encountered. The characters are ignored, but the resulting decoded bytes may be invalid.
  * `InvalidBase64LengthDefect` – When decoding a block of base64 encoded bytes, the number of non-padding base64 characters was invalid (1 more than a multiple of 4). The encoded block was kept as-is.
