# pwd — The password database

This module provides access to the Unix user account and password database. It
is available on all Unix versions.

Password database entries are reported as a tuple-like object, whose
attributes correspond to the members of the `passwd` structure (Attribute
field below, see `<pwd.h>`):

Index | Attribute | Meaning  
---|---|---  
0 | `pw_name` | Login name  
1 | `pw_passwd` | Optional encrypted password  
2 | `pw_uid` | Numerical user ID  
3 | `pw_gid` | Numerical group ID  
4 | `pw_gecos` | User name or comment field  
5 | `pw_dir` | User home directory  
6 | `pw_shell` | User command interpreter  
The uid and gid items are integers, all others are strings. `KeyError` is
raised if the entry asked for cannot be found.

Note

In traditional Unix the field `pw_passwd` usually contains a password
encrypted with a DES derived algorithm (see module `crypt`). However most
modern unices use a so-called shadow password system. On those unices the
pw_passwd field only contains an asterisk (`'*'`) or the letter `'x'` where
the encrypted password is stored in a file `/etc/shadow` which is not world
readable. Whether the pw_passwd field contains anything useful is system-
dependent. If available, the `spwd` module should be used where access to the
encrypted password is required.

It defines the following items:

`pwd.getpwuid(uid)`

    
Return the password database entry for the given numeric user ID.

`pwd.getpwnam(name)`

    
Return the password database entry for the given user name.

`pwd.getpwall()`

    
Return a list of all available password database entries, in arbitrary order.
