# xmlrpc.server — Basic XML-RPC servers

Source code: Lib/xmlrpc/server.py

The `xmlrpc.server` module provides a basic server framework for XML-RPC
servers written in Python. Servers can either be free standing, using
`SimpleXMLRPCServer`, or embedded in a CGI environment, using
`CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler`.

Warning

The `xmlrpc.server` module is not secure against maliciously constructed data.
If you need to parse untrusted or unauthenticated data see XML
vulnerabilities.

`class xmlrpc.server.SimpleXMLRPCServer(addr,
requestHandler=SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler, logRequests=True, allow_none=False,
encoding=None, bind_and_activate=True, use_builtin_types=False)`

    
Create a new server instance. This class provides methods for registration of
functions that can be called by the XML-RPC protocol. The requestHandler
parameter should be a factory for request handler instances; it defaults to
`SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler`. The addr and requestHandler parameters are
passed to the `socketserver.TCPServer` constructor. If logRequests is true
(the default), requests will be logged; setting this parameter to false will
turn off logging. The allow_none and encoding parameters are passed on to
`xmlrpc.client` and control the XML-RPC responses that will be returned from
the server. The bind_and_activate parameter controls whether `server_bind()`
and `server_activate()` are called immediately by the constructor; it defaults
to true. Setting it to false allows code to manipulate the allow_reuse_address
class variable before the address is bound. The use_builtin_types parameter is
passed to the `loads()` function and controls which types are processed when
date/times values or binary data are received; it defaults to false.

Changed in version 3.3: The use_builtin_types flag was added.

`class xmlrpc.server.CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler(allow_none=False, encoding=None,
use_builtin_types=False)`

    
Create a new instance to handle XML-RPC requests in a CGI environment. The
allow_none and encoding parameters are passed on to `xmlrpc.client` and
control the XML-RPC responses that will be returned from the server. The
use_builtin_types parameter is passed to the `loads()` function and controls
which types are processed when date/times values or binary data are received;
it defaults to false.

Changed in version 3.3: The use_builtin_types flag was added.

`class xmlrpc.server.SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler`

    
Create a new request handler instance. This request handler supports `POST`
requests and modifies logging so that the logRequests parameter to the
`SimpleXMLRPCServer` constructor parameter is honored.

## SimpleXMLRPCServer Objects

The `SimpleXMLRPCServer` class is based on `socketserver.TCPServer` and
provides a means of creating simple, stand alone XML-RPC servers.

`SimpleXMLRPCServer.register_function(function=None, name=None)`

    
Register a function that can respond to XML-RPC requests. If name is given, it
will be the method name associated with function, otherwise
`function.__name__` will be used. name is a string, and may contain characters
not legal in Python identifiers, including the period character.

This method can also be used as a decorator. When used as a decorator, name
can only be given as a keyword argument to register function under name. If no
name is given, `function.__name__` will be used.

Changed in version 3.7: `register_function()` can be used as a decorator.

`SimpleXMLRPCServer.register_instance(instance, allow_dotted_names=False)`

    
Register an object which is used to expose method names which have not been
registered using `register_function()`. If instance contains a `_dispatch()`
method, it is called with the requested method name and the parameters from
the request. Its API is `def _dispatch(self, method, params)` (note that
params does not represent a variable argument list). If it calls an underlying
function to perform its task, that function is called as `func(*params)`,
expanding the parameter list. The return value from `_dispatch()` is returned
to the client as the result. If instance does not have a `_dispatch()` method,
it is searched for an attribute matching the name of the requested method.

If the optional allow_dotted_names argument is true and the instance does not
have a `_dispatch()` method, then if the requested method name contains
periods, each component of the method name is searched for individually, with
the effect that a simple hierarchical search is performed. The value found
from this search is then called with the parameters from the request, and the
return value is passed back to the client.

Warning

Enabling the allow_dotted_names option allows intruders to access your
module’s global variables and may allow intruders to execute arbitrary code on
your machine. Only use this option on a secure, closed network.

`SimpleXMLRPCServer.register_introspection_functions()`

    
Registers the XML-RPC introspection functions `system.listMethods`,
`system.methodHelp` and `system.methodSignature`.

`SimpleXMLRPCServer.register_multicall_functions()`

    
Registers the XML-RPC multicall function system.multicall.

`SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler.rpc_paths`

    
An attribute value that must be a tuple listing valid path portions of the URL
for receiving XML-RPC requests. Requests posted to other paths will result in
a 404 “no such page” HTTP error. If this tuple is empty, all paths will be
considered valid. The default value is `('/', '/RPC2')`.

### SimpleXMLRPCServer Example

Server code:

    
    from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer
    from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler
    
    # Restrict to a particular path.
    class RequestHandler(SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler):
        rpc_paths = ('/RPC2',)
    
    # Create server
    with SimpleXMLRPCServer(('localhost', 8000),
                            requestHandler=RequestHandler) as server:
        server.register_introspection_functions()
    
        # Register pow() function; this will use the value of
        # pow.__name__ as the name, which is just 'pow'.
        server.register_function(pow)
    
        # Register a function under a different name
        def adder_function(x, y):
            return x + y
        server.register_function(adder_function, 'add')
    
        # Register an instance; all the methods of the instance are
        # published as XML-RPC methods (in this case, just 'mul').
        class MyFuncs:
            def mul(self, x, y):
                return x * y
    
        server.register_instance(MyFuncs())
    
        # Run the server's main loop
        server.serve_forever()
    
The following client code will call the methods made available by the
preceding server:

    
    import xmlrpc.client
    
    s = xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy('http://localhost:8000')
    print(s.pow(2,3))  # Returns 2**3 = 8
    print(s.add(2,3))  # Returns 5
    print(s.mul(5,2))  # Returns 5*2 = 10
    
    # Print list of available methods
    print(s.system.listMethods())
    
`register_function()` can also be used as a decorator. The previous server
example can register functions in a decorator way:

    
    from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCServer
    from xmlrpc.server import SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler
    
    class RequestHandler(SimpleXMLRPCRequestHandler):
        rpc_paths = ('/RPC2',)
    
    with SimpleXMLRPCServer(('localhost', 8000),
                            requestHandler=RequestHandler) as server:
        server.register_introspection_functions()
    
        # Register pow() function; this will use the value of
        # pow.__name__ as the name, which is just 'pow'.
        server.register_function(pow)
    
        # Register a function under a different name, using
        # register_function as a decorator. *name* can only be given
        # as a keyword argument.
        @server.register_function(name='add')
        def adder_function(x, y):
            return x + y
    
        # Register a function under function.__name__.
        @server.register_function
        def mul(x, y):
            return x * y
    
        server.serve_forever()
    
The following example included in the `Lib/xmlrpc/server.py` module shows a
server allowing dotted names and registering a multicall function.

Warning

Enabling the allow_dotted_names option allows intruders to access your
module’s global variables and may allow intruders to execute arbitrary code on
your machine. Only use this example only within a secure, closed network.

    
    import datetime
    
    class ExampleService:
        def getData(self):
            return '42'
    
        class currentTime:
            @staticmethod
            def getCurrentTime():
                return datetime.datetime.now()
    
    with SimpleXMLRPCServer(("localhost", 8000)) as server:
        server.register_function(pow)
        server.register_function(lambda x,y: x+y, 'add')
        server.register_instance(ExampleService(), allow_dotted_names=True)
        server.register_multicall_functions()
        print('Serving XML-RPC on localhost port 8000')
        try:
            server.serve_forever()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("\nKeyboard interrupt received, exiting.")
            sys.exit(0)
    
This ExampleService demo can be invoked from the command line:

    
    python -m xmlrpc.server
    
The client that interacts with the above server is included in
`Lib/xmlrpc/client.py`:

    
    server = ServerProxy("http://localhost:8000")
    
    try:
        print(server.currentTime.getCurrentTime())
    except Error as v:
        print("ERROR", v)
    
    multi = MultiCall(server)
    multi.getData()
    multi.pow(2,9)
    multi.add(1,2)
    try:
        for response in multi():
            print(response)
    except Error as v:
        print("ERROR", v)
    
This client which interacts with the demo XMLRPC server can be invoked as:

    
    python -m xmlrpc.client
    
## CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler

The `CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler` class can be used to handle XML-RPC requests
sent to Python CGI scripts.

`CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.register_function(function=None, name=None)`

    
Register a function that can respond to XML-RPC requests. If name is given, it
will be the method name associated with function, otherwise
`function.__name__` will be used. name is a string, and may contain characters
not legal in Python identifiers, including the period character.

This method can also be used as a decorator. When used as a decorator, name
can only be given as a keyword argument to register function under name. If no
name is given, `function.__name__` will be used.

Changed in version 3.7: `register_function()` can be used as a decorator.

`CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.register_instance(instance)`

    
Register an object which is used to expose method names which have not been
registered using `register_function()`. If instance contains a `_dispatch()`
method, it is called with the requested method name and the parameters from
the request; the return value is returned to the client as the result. If
instance does not have a `_dispatch()` method, it is searched for an attribute
matching the name of the requested method; if the requested method name
contains periods, each component of the method name is searched for
individually, with the effect that a simple hierarchical search is performed.
The value found from this search is then called with the parameters from the
request, and the return value is passed back to the client.

`CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.register_introspection_functions()`

    
Register the XML-RPC introspection functions `system.listMethods`,
`system.methodHelp` and `system.methodSignature`.

`CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.register_multicall_functions()`

    
Register the XML-RPC multicall function `system.multicall`.

`CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.handle_request(request_text=None)`

    
Handle an XML-RPC request. If request_text is given, it should be the POST
data provided by the HTTP server, otherwise the contents of stdin will be
used.

Example:

    
    class MyFuncs:
        def mul(self, x, y):
            return x * y
    
    
    handler = CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler()
    handler.register_function(pow)
    handler.register_function(lambda x,y: x+y, 'add')
    handler.register_introspection_functions()
    handler.register_instance(MyFuncs())
    handler.handle_request()
    
## Documenting XMLRPC server

These classes extend the above classes to serve HTML documentation in response
to HTTP GET requests. Servers can either be free standing, using
`DocXMLRPCServer`, or embedded in a CGI environment, using
`DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler`.

`class xmlrpc.server.DocXMLRPCServer(addr,
requestHandler=DocXMLRPCRequestHandler, logRequests=True, allow_none=False,
encoding=None, bind_and_activate=True, use_builtin_types=True)`

    
Create a new server instance. All parameters have the same meaning as for
`SimpleXMLRPCServer`; requestHandler defaults to `DocXMLRPCRequestHandler`.

Changed in version 3.3: The use_builtin_types flag was added.

`class xmlrpc.server.DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler`

    
Create a new instance to handle XML-RPC requests in a CGI environment.

`class xmlrpc.server.DocXMLRPCRequestHandler`

    
Create a new request handler instance. This request handler supports XML-RPC
POST requests, documentation GET requests, and modifies logging so that the
logRequests parameter to the `DocXMLRPCServer` constructor parameter is
honored.

## DocXMLRPCServer Objects

The `DocXMLRPCServer` class is derived from `SimpleXMLRPCServer` and provides
a means of creating self-documenting, stand alone XML-RPC servers. HTTP POST
requests are handled as XML-RPC method calls. HTTP GET requests are handled by
generating pydoc-style HTML documentation. This allows a server to provide its
own web-based documentation.

`DocXMLRPCServer.set_server_title(server_title)`

    
Set the title used in the generated HTML documentation. This title will be
used inside the HTML “title” element.

`DocXMLRPCServer.set_server_name(server_name)`

    
Set the name used in the generated HTML documentation. This name will appear
at the top of the generated documentation inside a “h1” element.

`DocXMLRPCServer.set_server_documentation(server_documentation)`

    
Set the description used in the generated HTML documentation. This description
will appear as a paragraph, below the server name, in the documentation.

## DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler

The `DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler` class is derived from
`CGIXMLRPCRequestHandler` and provides a means of creating self-documenting,
XML-RPC CGI scripts. HTTP POST requests are handled as XML-RPC method calls.
HTTP GET requests are handled by generating pydoc-style HTML documentation.
This allows a server to provide its own web-based documentation.

`DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.set_server_title(server_title)`

    
Set the title used in the generated HTML documentation. This title will be
used inside the HTML “title” element.

`DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.set_server_name(server_name)`

    
Set the name used in the generated HTML documentation. This name will appear
at the top of the generated documentation inside a “h1” element.

`DocCGIXMLRPCRequestHandler.set_server_documentation(server_documentation)`

    
Set the description used in the generated HTML documentation. This description
will appear as a paragraph, below the server name, in the documentation.
