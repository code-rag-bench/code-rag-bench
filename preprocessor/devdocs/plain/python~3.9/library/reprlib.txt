# reprlib — Alternate repr() implementation

Source code: Lib/reprlib.py

The `reprlib` module provides a means for producing object representations
with limits on the size of the resulting strings. This is used in the Python
debugger and may be useful in other contexts as well.

This module provides a class, an instance, and a function:

`class reprlib.Repr`

    
Class which provides formatting services useful in implementing functions
similar to the built-in `repr()`; size limits for different object types are
added to avoid the generation of representations which are excessively long.

`reprlib.aRepr`

    
This is an instance of `Repr` which is used to provide the `repr()` function
described below. Changing the attributes of this object will affect the size
limits used by `repr()` and the Python debugger.

`reprlib.repr(obj)`

    
This is the `repr()` method of `aRepr`. It returns a string similar to that
returned by the built-in function of the same name, but with limits on most
sizes.

In addition to size-limiting tools, the module also provides a decorator for
detecting recursive calls to `__repr__()` and substituting a placeholder
string instead.

`@reprlib.recursive_repr(fillvalue="...")`

    
Decorator for `__repr__()` methods to detect recursive calls within the same
thread. If a recursive call is made, the fillvalue is returned, otherwise, the
usual `__repr__()` call is made. For example:

    
    >>> from reprlib import recursive_repr
    >>> class MyList(list):
    ...     @recursive_repr()
    ...     def __repr__(self):
    ...         return '<' + '|'.join(map(repr, self)) + '>'
    ...
    >>> m = MyList('abc')
    >>> m.append(m)
    >>> m.append('x')
    >>> print(m)
    <'a'|'b'|'c'|...|'x'>
    
New in version 3.2.

## Repr Objects

`Repr` instances provide several attributes which can be used to provide size
limits for the representations of different object types, and methods which
format specific object types.

`Repr.maxlevel`

    
Depth limit on the creation of recursive representations. The default is `6`.

`Repr.maxdict`

`Repr.maxlist`

`Repr.maxtuple`

`Repr.maxset`

`Repr.maxfrozenset`

`Repr.maxdeque`

`Repr.maxarray`

    
Limits on the number of entries represented for the named object type. The
default is `4` for `maxdict`, `5` for `maxarray`, and `6` for the others.

`Repr.maxlong`

    
Maximum number of characters in the representation for an integer. Digits are
dropped from the middle. The default is `40`.

`Repr.maxstring`

    
Limit on the number of characters in the representation of the string. Note
that the “normal” representation of the string is used as the character
source: if escape sequences are needed in the representation, these may be
mangled when the representation is shortened. The default is `30`.

`Repr.maxother`

    
This limit is used to control the size of object types for which no specific
formatting method is available on the `Repr` object. It is applied in a
similar manner as `maxstring`. The default is `20`.

`Repr.repr(obj)`

    
The equivalent to the built-in `repr()` that uses the formatting imposed by
the instance.

`Repr.repr1(obj, level)`

    
Recursive implementation used by `repr()`. This uses the type of obj to
determine which formatting method to call, passing it obj and level. The type-
specific methods should call `repr1()` to perform recursive formatting, with
`level - 1` for the value of level in the recursive call.

`Repr.repr_TYPE(obj, level)`

    
Formatting methods for specific types are implemented as methods with a name
based on the type name. In the method name, TYPE is replaced by
`'_'.join(type(obj).__name__.split())`. Dispatch to these methods is handled
by `repr1()`. Type-specific methods which need to recursively format a value
should call `self.repr1(subobj, level - 1)`.

## Subclassing Repr Objects

The use of dynamic dispatching by `Repr.repr1()` allows subclasses of `Repr`
to add support for additional built-in object types or to modify the handling
of types already supported. This example shows how special support for file
objects could be added:

    
    import reprlib
    import sys
    
    class MyRepr(reprlib.Repr):
    
        def repr_TextIOWrapper(self, obj, level):
            if obj.name in {'<stdin>', '<stdout>', '<stderr>'}:
                return obj.name
            return repr(obj)
    
    aRepr = MyRepr()
    print(aRepr.repr(sys.stdin))         # prints '<stdin>'
