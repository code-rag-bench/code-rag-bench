# email.mime: Creating email and MIME objects from scratch

Source code: Lib/email/mime/

This module is part of the legacy (`Compat32`) email API. Its functionality is
partially replaced by the `contentmanager` in the new API, but in certain
applications these classes may still be useful, even in non-legacy code.

Ordinarily, you get a message object structure by passing a file or some text
to a parser, which parses the text and returns the root message object.
However you can also build a complete message structure from scratch, or even
individual `Message` objects by hand. In fact, you can also take an existing
structure and add new `Message` objects, move them around, etc. This makes a
very convenient interface for slicing-and-dicing MIME messages.

You can create a new object structure by creating `Message` instances, adding
attachments and all the appropriate headers manually. For MIME messages
though, the `email` package provides some convenient subclasses to make things
easier.

Here are the classes:

`class email.mime.base.MIMEBase(_maintype, _subtype, *, policy=compat32,
**_params)`

    
Module: `email.mime.base`

This is the base class for all the MIME-specific subclasses of `Message`.
Ordinarily you won’t create instances specifically of `MIMEBase`, although you
could. `MIMEBase` is provided primarily as a convenient base class for more
specific MIME-aware subclasses.

_maintype is the Content-Type major type (e.g. text or image), and _subtype is
the Content-Type minor type (e.g. plain or gif). _params is a parameter
key/value dictionary and is passed directly to `Message.add_header`.

If policy is specified, (defaults to the `compat32` policy) it will be passed
to `Message`.

The `MIMEBase` class always adds a Content-Type header (based on _maintype,
_subtype, and _params), and a MIME-Version header (always set to `1.0`).

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.

`class email.mime.nonmultipart.MIMENonMultipart`

    
Module: `email.mime.nonmultipart`

A subclass of `MIMEBase`, this is an intermediate base class for MIME messages
that are not multipart. The primary purpose of this class is to prevent the
use of the `attach()` method, which only makes sense for multipart messages.
If `attach()` is called, a `MultipartConversionError` exception is raised.

`class email.mime.multipart.MIMEMultipart(_subtype='mixed', boundary=None,
_subparts=None, *, policy=compat32, **_params)`

    
Module: `email.mime.multipart`

A subclass of `MIMEBase`, this is an intermediate base class for MIME messages
that are multipart. Optional _subtype defaults to mixed, but can be used to
specify the subtype of the message. A Content-Type header of
multipart/_subtype will be added to the message object. A MIME-Version header
will also be added.

Optional boundary is the multipart boundary string. When `None` (the default),
the boundary is calculated when needed (for example, when the message is
serialized).

_subparts is a sequence of initial subparts for the payload. It must be
possible to convert this sequence to a list. You can always attach new
subparts to the message by using the `Message.attach` method.

Optional policy argument defaults to `compat32`.

Additional parameters for the Content-Type header are taken from the keyword
arguments, or passed into the _params argument, which is a keyword dictionary.

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.

`class email.mime.application.MIMEApplication(_data, _subtype='octet-stream',
_encoder=email.encoders.encode_base64, *, policy=compat32, **_params)`

    
Module: `email.mime.application`

A subclass of `MIMENonMultipart`, the `MIMEApplication` class is used to
represent MIME message objects of major type application. _data is a string
containing the raw byte data. Optional _subtype specifies the MIME subtype and
defaults to octet-stream.

Optional _encoder is a callable (i.e. function) which will perform the actual
encoding of the data for transport. This callable takes one argument, which is
the `MIMEApplication` instance. It should use `get_payload()` and
`set_payload()` to change the payload to encoded form. It should also add any
Content-Transfer-Encoding or other headers to the message object as necessary.
The default encoding is base64. See the `email.encoders` module for a list of
the built-in encoders.

Optional policy argument defaults to `compat32`.

_params are passed straight through to the base class constructor.

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.

`class email.mime.audio.MIMEAudio(_audiodata, _subtype=None,
_encoder=email.encoders.encode_base64, *, policy=compat32, **_params)`

    
Module: `email.mime.audio`

A subclass of `MIMENonMultipart`, the `MIMEAudio` class is used to create MIME
message objects of major type audio. _audiodata is a string containing the raw
audio data. If this data can be decoded by the standard Python module
`sndhdr`, then the subtype will be automatically included in the Content-Type
header. Otherwise you can explicitly specify the audio subtype via the
_subtype argument. If the minor type could not be guessed and _subtype was not
given, then `TypeError` is raised.

Optional _encoder is a callable (i.e. function) which will perform the actual
encoding of the audio data for transport. This callable takes one argument,
which is the `MIMEAudio` instance. It should use `get_payload()` and
`set_payload()` to change the payload to encoded form. It should also add any
Content-Transfer-Encoding or other headers to the message object as necessary.
The default encoding is base64. See the `email.encoders` module for a list of
the built-in encoders.

Optional policy argument defaults to `compat32`.

_params are passed straight through to the base class constructor.

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.

`class email.mime.image.MIMEImage(_imagedata, _subtype=None,
_encoder=email.encoders.encode_base64, *, policy=compat32, **_params)`

    
Module: `email.mime.image`

A subclass of `MIMENonMultipart`, the `MIMEImage` class is used to create MIME
message objects of major type image. _imagedata is a string containing the raw
image data. If this data can be decoded by the standard Python module
`imghdr`, then the subtype will be automatically included in the Content-Type
header. Otherwise you can explicitly specify the image subtype via the
_subtype argument. If the minor type could not be guessed and _subtype was not
given, then `TypeError` is raised.

Optional _encoder is a callable (i.e. function) which will perform the actual
encoding of the image data for transport. This callable takes one argument,
which is the `MIMEImage` instance. It should use `get_payload()` and
`set_payload()` to change the payload to encoded form. It should also add any
Content-Transfer-Encoding or other headers to the message object as necessary.
The default encoding is base64. See the `email.encoders` module for a list of
the built-in encoders.

Optional policy argument defaults to `compat32`.

_params are passed straight through to the `MIMEBase` constructor.

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.

`class email.mime.message.MIMEMessage(_msg, _subtype='rfc822', *,
policy=compat32)`

    
Module: `email.mime.message`

A subclass of `MIMENonMultipart`, the `MIMEMessage` class is used to create
MIME objects of main type message. _msg is used as the payload, and must be an
instance of class `Message` (or a subclass thereof), otherwise a `TypeError`
is raised.

Optional _subtype sets the subtype of the message; it defaults to rfc822.

Optional policy argument defaults to `compat32`.

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.

`class email.mime.text.MIMEText(_text, _subtype='plain', _charset=None, *,
policy=compat32)`

    
Module: `email.mime.text`

A subclass of `MIMENonMultipart`, the `MIMEText` class is used to create MIME
objects of major type text. _text is the string for the payload. _subtype is
the minor type and defaults to plain. _charset is the character set of the
text and is passed as an argument to the `MIMENonMultipart` constructor; it
defaults to `us-ascii` if the string contains only `ascii` code points, and
`utf-8` otherwise. The _charset parameter accepts either a string or a
`Charset` instance.

Unless the _charset argument is explicitly set to `None`, the MIMEText object
created will have both a Content-Type header with a `charset` parameter, and a
Content-Transfer-Encoding header. This means that a subsequent `set_payload`
call will not result in an encoded payload, even if a charset is passed in the
`set_payload` command. You can “reset” this behavior by deleting the `Content-
Transfer-Encoding` header, after which a `set_payload` call will automatically
encode the new payload (and add a new Content-Transfer-Encoding header).

Optional policy argument defaults to `compat32`.

Changed in version 3.5: _charset also accepts `Charset` instances.

Changed in version 3.6: Added policy keyword-only parameter.
