# getpass — Portable password input

Source code: Lib/getpass.py

The `getpass` module provides two functions:

`getpass.getpass(prompt='Password: ', stream=None)`

    
Prompt the user for a password without echoing. The user is prompted using the
string prompt, which defaults to `'Password: '`. On Unix, the prompt is
written to the file-like object stream using the replace error handler if
needed. stream defaults to the controlling terminal (`/dev/tty`) or if that is
unavailable to `sys.stderr` (this argument is ignored on Windows).

If echo free input is unavailable getpass() falls back to printing a warning
message to stream and reading from `sys.stdin` and issuing a `GetPassWarning`.

Note

If you call getpass from within IDLE, the input may be done in the terminal
you launched IDLE from rather than the idle window itself.

`exception getpass.GetPassWarning`

    
A `UserWarning` subclass issued when password input may be echoed.

`getpass.getuser()`

    
Return the “login name” of the user.

This function checks the environment variables `LOGNAME`, `USER`, `LNAME` and
`USERNAME`, in order, and returns the value of the first one which is set to a
non-empty string. If none are set, the login name from the password database
is returned on systems which support the `pwd` module, otherwise, an exception
is raised.

In general, this function should be preferred over `os.getlogin()`.
