# gzip — Support for gzip files

Source code: Lib/gzip.py

This module provides a simple interface to compress and decompress files just
like the GNU programs gzip and gunzip would.

The data compression is provided by the `zlib` module.

The `gzip` module provides the `GzipFile` class, as well as the `open()`,
`compress()` and `decompress()` convenience functions. The `GzipFile` class
reads and writes gzip-format files, automatically compressing or decompressing
the data so that it looks like an ordinary file object.

Note that additional file formats which can be decompressed by the gzip and
gunzip programs, such as those produced by compress and pack, are not
supported by this module.

The module defines the following items:

`gzip.open(filename, mode='rb', compresslevel=9, encoding=None, errors=None,
newline=None)`

    
Open a gzip-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a file object.

The filename argument can be an actual filename (a `str` or `bytes` object),
or an existing file object to read from or write to.

The mode argument can be any of `'r'`, `'rb'`, `'a'`, `'ab'`, `'w'`, `'wb'`,
`'x'` or `'xb'` for binary mode, or `'rt'`, `'at'`, `'wt'`, or `'xt'` for text
mode. The default is `'rb'`.

The compresslevel argument is an integer from 0 to 9, as for the `GzipFile`
constructor.

For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the `GzipFile` constructor:
`GzipFile(filename, mode, compresslevel)`. In this case, the encoding, errors
and newline arguments must not be provided.

For text mode, a `GzipFile` object is created, and wrapped in an
`io.TextIOWrapper` instance with the specified encoding, error handling
behavior, and line ending(s).

Changed in version 3.3: Added support for filename being a file object,
support for text mode, and the encoding, errors and newline arguments.

Changed in version 3.4: Added support for the `'x'`, `'xb'` and `'xt'` modes.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`exception gzip.BadGzipFile`

    
An exception raised for invalid gzip files. It inherits `OSError`. `EOFError`
and `zlib.error` can also be raised for invalid gzip files.

New in version 3.8.

`class gzip.GzipFile(filename=None, mode=None, compresslevel=9, fileobj=None,
mtime=None)`

    
Constructor for the `GzipFile` class, which simulates most of the methods of a
file object, with the exception of the `truncate()` method. At least one of
fileobj and filename must be given a non-trivial value.

The new class instance is based on fileobj, which can be a regular file, an
`io.BytesIO` object, or any other object which simulates a file. It defaults
to `None`, in which case filename is opened to provide a file object.

When fileobj is not `None`, the filename argument is only used to be included
in the gzip file header, which may include the original filename of the
uncompressed file. It defaults to the filename of fileobj, if discernible;
otherwise, it defaults to the empty string, and in this case the original
filename is not included in the header.

The mode argument can be any of `'r'`, `'rb'`, `'a'`, `'ab'`, `'w'`, `'wb'`,
`'x'`, or `'xb'`, depending on whether the file will be read or written. The
default is the mode of fileobj if discernible; otherwise, the default is
`'rb'`. In future Python releases the mode of fileobj will not be used. It is
better to always specify mode for writing.

Note that the file is always opened in binary mode. To open a compressed file
in text mode, use `open()` (or wrap your `GzipFile` with an
`io.TextIOWrapper`).

The compresslevel argument is an integer from `0` to `9` controlling the level
of compression; `1` is fastest and produces the least compression, and `9` is
slowest and produces the most compression. `0` is no compression. The default
is `9`.

The mtime argument is an optional numeric timestamp to be written to the last
modification time field in the stream when compressing. It should only be
provided in compression mode. If omitted or `None`, the current time is used.
See the `mtime` attribute for more details.

Calling a `GzipFile` object’s `close()` method does not close fileobj, since
you might wish to append more material after the compressed data. This also
allows you to pass an `io.BytesIO` object opened for writing as fileobj, and
retrieve the resulting memory buffer using the `io.BytesIO` object’s
`getvalue()` method.

`GzipFile` supports the `io.BufferedIOBase` interface, including iteration and
the `with` statement. Only the `truncate()` method isn’t implemented.

`GzipFile` also provides the following method and attribute:

`peek(n)`

    
Read n uncompressed bytes without advancing the file position. At most one
single read on the compressed stream is done to satisfy the call. The number
of bytes returned may be more or less than requested.

Note

While calling `peek()` does not change the file position of the `GzipFile`, it
may change the position of the underlying file object (e.g. if the `GzipFile`
was constructed with the fileobj parameter).

New in version 3.2.

`mtime`

    
When decompressing, the value of the last modification time field in the most
recently read header may be read from this attribute, as an integer. The
initial value before reading any headers is `None`.

All gzip compressed streams are required to contain this timestamp field. Some
programs, such as gunzip, make use of the timestamp. The format is the same as
the return value of `time.time()` and the `st_mtime` attribute of the object
returned by `os.stat()`.

Changed in version 3.1: Support for the `with` statement was added, along with
the mtime constructor argument and `mtime` attribute.

Changed in version 3.2: Support for zero-padded and unseekable files was
added.

Changed in version 3.3: The `io.BufferedIOBase.read1()` method is now
implemented.

Changed in version 3.4: Added support for the `'x'` and `'xb'` modes.

Changed in version 3.5: Added support for writing arbitrary bytes-like
objects. The `read()` method now accepts an argument of `None`.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

Deprecated since version 3.9: Opening `GzipFile` for writing without
specifying the mode argument is deprecated.

`gzip.compress(data, compresslevel=9, *, mtime=None)`

    
Compress the data, returning a `bytes` object containing the compressed data.
compresslevel and mtime have the same meaning as in the `GzipFile` constructor
above.

New in version 3.2.

Changed in version 3.8: Added the mtime parameter for reproducible output.

`gzip.decompress(data)`

    
Decompress the data, returning a `bytes` object containing the uncompressed
data.

New in version 3.2.

## Examples of usage

Example of how to read a compressed file:

    
    import gzip
    with gzip.open('/home/joe/file.txt.gz', 'rb') as f:
        file_content = f.read()
    
Example of how to create a compressed GZIP file:

    
    import gzip
    content = b"Lots of content here"
    with gzip.open('/home/joe/file.txt.gz', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(content)
    
Example of how to GZIP compress an existing file:

    
    import gzip
    import shutil
    with open('/home/joe/file.txt', 'rb') as f_in:
        with gzip.open('/home/joe/file.txt.gz', 'wb') as f_out:
            shutil.copyfileobj(f_in, f_out)
    
Example of how to GZIP compress a binary string:

    
    import gzip
    s_in = b"Lots of content here"
    s_out = gzip.compress(s_in)

## Command Line Interface

The `gzip` module provides a simple command line interface to compress or
decompress files.

Once executed the `gzip` module keeps the input file(s).

Changed in version 3.8: Add a new command line interface with a usage. By
default, when you will execute the CLI, the default compression level is 6.

### Command line options

`file`

    
If file is not specified, read from `sys.stdin`.

`--fast`

    
Indicates the fastest compression method (less compression).

`--best`

    
Indicates the slowest compression method (best compression).

`-d, --decompress`

    
Decompress the given file.

`-h, --help`

    
Show the help message.
