# XML Processing Modules

Source code: Lib/xml/

Python’s interfaces for processing XML are grouped in the `xml` package.

Warning

The XML modules are not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed
data. If you need to parse untrusted or unauthenticated data see the XML
vulnerabilities and The defusedxml Package sections.

It is important to note that modules in the `xml` package require that there
be at least one SAX-compliant XML parser available. The Expat parser is
included with Python, so the `xml.parsers.expat` module will always be
available.

The documentation for the `xml.dom` and `xml.sax` packages are the definition
of the Python bindings for the DOM and SAX interfaces.

The XML handling submodules are:

  * `xml.etree.ElementTree`: the ElementTree API, a simple and lightweight XML processor

  * `xml.dom`: the DOM API definition
  * `xml.dom.minidom`: a minimal DOM implementation
  * `xml.dom.pulldom`: support for building partial DOM trees

  * `xml.sax`: SAX2 base classes and convenience functions
  * `xml.parsers.expat`: the Expat parser binding

## XML vulnerabilities

The XML processing modules are not secure against maliciously constructed
data. An attacker can abuse XML features to carry out denial of service
attacks, access local files, generate network connections to other machines,
or circumvent firewalls.

The following table gives an overview of the known attacks and whether the
various modules are vulnerable to them.

kind | sax | etree | minidom | pulldom | xmlrpc  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
billion laughs | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable  
quadratic blowup | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable | Vulnerable  
external entity expansion | Safe (4) | Safe (1) | Safe (2) | Safe (4) | Safe (3)  
DTD retrieval | Safe (4) | Safe | Safe | Safe (4) | Safe  
decompression bomb | Safe | Safe | Safe | Safe | Vulnerable  
  1. `xml.etree.ElementTree` doesn’t expand external entities and raises a `ParserError` when an entity occurs.
  2. `xml.dom.minidom` doesn’t expand external entities and simply returns the unexpanded entity verbatim.
  3. `xmlrpclib` doesn’t expand external entities and omits them.
  4. Since Python 3.7.1, external general entities are no longer processed by default.

billion laughs / exponential entity expansion

    
The Billion Laughs attack – also known as exponential entity expansion – uses
multiple levels of nested entities. Each entity refers to another entity
several times, and the final entity definition contains a small string. The
exponential expansion results in several gigabytes of text and consumes lots
of memory and CPU time.

quadratic blowup entity expansion

    
A quadratic blowup attack is similar to a Billion Laughs attack; it abuses
entity expansion, too. Instead of nested entities it repeats one large entity
with a couple of thousand chars over and over again. The attack isn’t as
efficient as the exponential case but it avoids triggering parser
countermeasures that forbid deeply-nested entities.

external entity expansion

    
Entity declarations can contain more than just text for replacement. They can
also point to external resources or local files. The XML parser accesses the
resource and embeds the content into the XML document.

DTD retrieval

    
Some XML libraries like Python’s `xml.dom.pulldom` retrieve document type
definitions from remote or local locations. The feature has similar
implications as the external entity expansion issue.

decompression bomb

    
Decompression bombs (aka ZIP bomb) apply to all XML libraries that can parse
compressed XML streams such as gzipped HTTP streams or LZMA-compressed files.
For an attacker it can reduce the amount of transmitted data by three
magnitudes or more.

The documentation for defusedxml on PyPI has further information about all
known attack vectors with examples and references.

## The `defusedxml` Package

defusedxml is a pure Python package with modified subclasses of all stdlib XML
parsers that prevent any potentially malicious operation. Use of this package
is recommended for any server code that parses untrusted XML data. The package
also ships with example exploits and extended documentation on more XML
exploits such as XPath injection.
