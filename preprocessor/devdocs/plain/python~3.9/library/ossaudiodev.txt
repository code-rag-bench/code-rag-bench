# ossaudiodev — Access to OSS-compatible audio devices

This module allows you to access the OSS (Open Sound System) audio interface.
OSS is available for a wide range of open-source and commercial Unices, and is
the standard audio interface for Linux and recent versions of FreeBSD.

Changed in version 3.3: Operations in this module now raise `OSError` where
`IOError` was raised.

Open Sound System Programmer’s Guide

    
the official documentation for the OSS C API

The module defines a large number of constants supplied by the OSS device
driver; see `<sys/soundcard.h>` on either Linux or FreeBSD for a listing.

`ossaudiodev` defines the following variables and functions:

`exception ossaudiodev.OSSAudioError`

    
This exception is raised on certain errors. The argument is a string
describing what went wrong.

(If `ossaudiodev` receives an error from a system call such as `open()`,
`write()`, or `ioctl()`, it raises `OSError`. Errors detected directly by
`ossaudiodev` result in `OSSAudioError`.)

(For backwards compatibility, the exception class is also available as
`ossaudiodev.error`.)

`ossaudiodev.open(mode)`

`ossaudiodev.open(device, mode)`

    
Open an audio device and return an OSS audio device object. This object
supports many file-like methods, such as `read()`, `write()`, and `fileno()`
(although there are subtle differences between conventional Unix read/write
semantics and those of OSS audio devices). It also supports a number of audio-
specific methods; see below for the complete list of methods.

device is the audio device filename to use. If it is not specified, this
module first looks in the environment variable `AUDIODEV` for a device to use.
If not found, it falls back to `/dev/dsp`.

mode is one of `'r'` for read-only (record) access, `'w'` for write-only
(playback) access and `'rw'` for both. Since many sound cards only allow one
process to have the recorder or player open at a time, it is a good idea to
open the device only for the activity needed. Further, some sound cards are
half-duplex: they can be opened for reading or writing, but not both at once.

Note the unusual calling syntax: the first argument is optional, and the
second is required. This is a historical artifact for compatibility with the
older `linuxaudiodev` module which `ossaudiodev` supersedes.

`ossaudiodev.openmixer([device])`

    
Open a mixer device and return an OSS mixer device object. device is the mixer
device filename to use. If it is not specified, this module first looks in the
environment variable `MIXERDEV` for a device to use. If not found, it falls
back to `/dev/mixer`.

## Audio Device Objects

Before you can write to or read from an audio device, you must call three
methods in the correct order:

  1. `setfmt()` to set the output format
  2. `channels()` to set the number of channels
  3. `speed()` to set the sample rate

Alternately, you can use the `setparameters()` method to set all three audio
parameters at once. This is more convenient, but may not be as flexible in all
cases.

The audio device objects returned by `open()` define the following methods and
(read-only) attributes:

`oss_audio_device.close()`

    
Explicitly close the audio device. When you are done writing to or reading
from an audio device, you should explicitly close it. A closed device cannot
be used again.

`oss_audio_device.fileno()`

    
Return the file descriptor associated with the device.

`oss_audio_device.read(size)`

    
Read size bytes from the audio input and return them as a Python string.
Unlike most Unix device drivers, OSS audio devices in blocking mode (the
default) will block `read()` until the entire requested amount of data is
available.

`oss_audio_device.write(data)`

    
Write a bytes-like object data to the audio device and return the number of
bytes written. If the audio device is in blocking mode (the default), the
entire data is always written (again, this is different from usual Unix device
semantics). If the device is in non-blocking mode, some data may not be
written—see `writeall()`.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.

`oss_audio_device.writeall(data)`

    
Write a bytes-like object data to the audio device: waits until the audio
device is able to accept data, writes as much data as it will accept, and
repeats until data has been completely written. If the device is in blocking
mode (the default), this has the same effect as `write()`; `writeall()` is
only useful in non-blocking mode. Has no return value, since the amount of
data written is always equal to the amount of data supplied.

Changed in version 3.5: Writable bytes-like object is now accepted.

Changed in version 3.2: Audio device objects also support the context
management protocol, i.e. they can be used in a `with` statement.

The following methods each map to exactly one `ioctl()` system call. The
correspondence is obvious: for example, `setfmt()` corresponds to the
`SNDCTL_DSP_SETFMT` ioctl, and `sync()` to `SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC` (this can be
useful when consulting the OSS documentation). If the underlying `ioctl()`
fails, they all raise `OSError`.

`oss_audio_device.nonblock()`

    
Put the device into non-blocking mode. Once in non-blocking mode, there is no
way to return it to blocking mode.

`oss_audio_device.getfmts()`

    
Return a bitmask of the audio output formats supported by the soundcard. Some
of the formats supported by OSS are:

Format | Description  
---|---  
`AFMT_MU_LAW` | a logarithmic encoding (used by Sun `.au` files and `/dev/audio`)  
`AFMT_A_LAW` | a logarithmic encoding  
`AFMT_IMA_ADPCM` | a 4:1 compressed format defined by the Interactive Multimedia Association  
`AFMT_U8` | Unsigned, 8-bit audio  
`AFMT_S16_LE` | Signed, 16-bit audio, little-endian byte order (as used by Intel processors)  
`AFMT_S16_BE` | Signed, 16-bit audio, big-endian byte order (as used by 68k, PowerPC, Sparc)  
`AFMT_S8` | Signed, 8 bit audio  
`AFMT_U16_LE` | Unsigned, 16-bit little-endian audio  
`AFMT_U16_BE` | Unsigned, 16-bit big-endian audio  
Consult the OSS documentation for a full list of audio formats, and note that
most devices support only a subset of these formats. Some older devices only
support `AFMT_U8`; the most common format used today is `AFMT_S16_LE`.

`oss_audio_device.setfmt(format)`

    
Try to set the current audio format to format—see `getfmts()` for a list.
Returns the audio format that the device was set to, which may not be the
requested format. May also be used to return the current audio format—do this
by passing an “audio format” of `AFMT_QUERY`.

`oss_audio_device.channels(nchannels)`

    
Set the number of output channels to nchannels. A value of 1 indicates
monophonic sound, 2 stereophonic. Some devices may have more than 2 channels,
and some high-end devices may not support mono. Returns the number of channels
the device was set to.

`oss_audio_device.speed(samplerate)`

    
Try to set the audio sampling rate to samplerate samples per second. Returns
the rate actually set. Most sound devices don’t support arbitrary sampling
rates. Common rates are:

Rate | Description  
---|---  
8000 | default rate for `/dev/audio`  
11025 | speech recording  
22050 |   
44100 | CD quality audio (at 16 bits/sample and 2 channels)  
96000 | DVD quality audio (at 24 bits/sample)  
`oss_audio_device.sync()`

    
Wait until the sound device has played every byte in its buffer. (This happens
implicitly when the device is closed.) The OSS documentation recommends
closing and re-opening the device rather than using `sync()`.

`oss_audio_device.reset()`

    
Immediately stop playing or recording and return the device to a state where
it can accept commands. The OSS documentation recommends closing and re-
opening the device after calling `reset()`.

`oss_audio_device.post()`

    
Tell the driver that there is likely to be a pause in the output, making it
possible for the device to handle the pause more intelligently. You might use
this after playing a spot sound effect, before waiting for user input, or
before doing disk I/O.

The following convenience methods combine several ioctls, or one ioctl and
some simple calculations.

`oss_audio_device.setparameters(format, nchannels, samplerate[,
strict=False])`

    
Set the key audio sampling parameters—sample format, number of channels, and
sampling rate—in one method call. format, nchannels, and samplerate should be
as specified in the `setfmt()`, `channels()`, and `speed()` methods. If strict
is true, `setparameters()` checks to see if each parameter was actually set to
the requested value, and raises `OSSAudioError` if not. Returns a tuple
(format, nchannels, samplerate) indicating the parameter values that were
actually set by the device driver (i.e., the same as the return values of
`setfmt()`, `channels()`, and `speed()`).

For example,

    
    (fmt, channels, rate) = dsp.setparameters(fmt, channels, rate)
    
is equivalent to

    
    fmt = dsp.setfmt(fmt)
    channels = dsp.channels(channels)
    rate = dsp.rate(rate)
    
`oss_audio_device.bufsize()`

    
Returns the size of the hardware buffer, in samples.

`oss_audio_device.obufcount()`

    
Returns the number of samples that are in the hardware buffer yet to be
played.

`oss_audio_device.obuffree()`

    
Returns the number of samples that could be queued into the hardware buffer to
be played without blocking.

Audio device objects also support several read-only attributes:

`oss_audio_device.closed`

    
Boolean indicating whether the device has been closed.

`oss_audio_device.name`

    
String containing the name of the device file.

`oss_audio_device.mode`

    
The I/O mode for the file, either `"r"`, `"rw"`, or `"w"`.

## Mixer Device Objects

The mixer object provides two file-like methods:

`oss_mixer_device.close()`

    
This method closes the open mixer device file. Any further attempts to use the
mixer after this file is closed will raise an `OSError`.

`oss_mixer_device.fileno()`

    
Returns the file handle number of the open mixer device file.

Changed in version 3.2: Mixer objects also support the context management
protocol.

The remaining methods are specific to audio mixing:

`oss_mixer_device.controls()`

    
This method returns a bitmask specifying the available mixer controls
(“Control” being a specific mixable “channel”, such as `SOUND_MIXER_PCM` or
`SOUND_MIXER_SYNTH`). This bitmask indicates a subset of all available mixer
controls—the `SOUND_MIXER_*` constants defined at module level. To determine
if, for example, the current mixer object supports a PCM mixer, use the
following Python code:

    
    mixer=ossaudiodev.openmixer()
    if mixer.controls() & (1 << ossaudiodev.SOUND_MIXER_PCM):
        # PCM is supported
        ... code ...
    
For most purposes, the `SOUND_MIXER_VOLUME` (master volume) and
`SOUND_MIXER_PCM` controls should suffice—but code that uses the mixer should
be flexible when it comes to choosing mixer controls. On the Gravis
Ultrasound, for example, `SOUND_MIXER_VOLUME` does not exist.

`oss_mixer_device.stereocontrols()`

    
Returns a bitmask indicating stereo mixer controls. If a bit is set, the
corresponding control is stereo; if it is unset, the control is either
monophonic or not supported by the mixer (use in combination with `controls()`
to determine which).

See the code example for the `controls()` function for an example of getting
data from a bitmask.

`oss_mixer_device.reccontrols()`

    
Returns a bitmask specifying the mixer controls that may be used to record.
See the code example for `controls()` for an example of reading from a
bitmask.

`oss_mixer_device.get(control)`

    
Returns the volume of a given mixer control. The returned volume is a 2-tuple
`(left_volume,right_volume)`. Volumes are specified as numbers from 0 (silent)
to 100 (full volume). If the control is monophonic, a 2-tuple is still
returned, but both volumes are the same.

Raises `OSSAudioError` if an invalid control is specified, or `OSError` if an
unsupported control is specified.

`oss_mixer_device.set(control, (left, right))`

    
Sets the volume for a given mixer control to `(left,right)`. `left` and
`right` must be ints and between 0 (silent) and 100 (full volume). On success,
the new volume is returned as a 2-tuple. Note that this may not be exactly the
same as the volume specified, because of the limited resolution of some
soundcard’s mixers.

Raises `OSSAudioError` if an invalid mixer control was specified, or if the
specified volumes were out-of-range.

`oss_mixer_device.get_recsrc()`

    
This method returns a bitmask indicating which control(s) are currently being
used as a recording source.

`oss_mixer_device.set_recsrc(bitmask)`

    
Call this function to specify a recording source. Returns a bitmask indicating
the new recording source (or sources) if successful; raises `OSError` if an
invalid source was specified. To set the current recording source to the
microphone input:

    
    mixer.setrecsrc (1 << ossaudiodev.SOUND_MIXER_MIC)
