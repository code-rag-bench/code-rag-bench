# builtins — Built-in objects

This module provides direct access to all ‘built-in’ identifiers of Python;
for example, `builtins.open` is the full name for the built-in function
`open()`. See Built-in Functions and Built-in Constants for documentation.

This module is not normally accessed explicitly by most applications, but can
be useful in modules that provide objects with the same name as a built-in
value, but in which the built-in of that name is also needed. For example, in
a module that wants to implement an `open()` function that wraps the built-in
`open()`, this module can be used directly:

    
    import builtins
    
    def open(path):
        f = builtins.open(path, 'r')
        return UpperCaser(f)
    
    class UpperCaser:
        '''Wrapper around a file that converts output to upper-case.'''
    
        def __init__(self, f):
            self._f = f
    
        def read(self, count=-1):
            return self._f.read(count).upper()
    
        # ...
    
As an implementation detail, most modules have the name `__builtins__` made
available as part of their globals. The value of `__builtins__` is normally
either this module or the value of this module’s `__dict__` attribute. Since
this is an implementation detail, it may not be used by alternate
implementations of Python.
