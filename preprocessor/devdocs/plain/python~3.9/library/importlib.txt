# importlib — The implementation of import

New in version 3.1.

Source code: Lib/importlib/__init__.py

## Introduction

The purpose of the `importlib` package is two-fold. One is to provide the
implementation of the `import` statement (and thus, by extension, the
`__import__()` function) in Python source code. This provides an
implementation of `import` which is portable to any Python interpreter. This
also provides an implementation which is easier to comprehend than one
implemented in a programming language other than Python.

Two, the components to implement `import` are exposed in this package, making
it easier for users to create their own custom objects (known generically as
an importer) to participate in the import process.

## Functions

`importlib.__import__(name, globals=None, locals=None, fromlist=(), level=0)`

    
An implementation of the built-in `__import__()` function.

Note

Programmatic importing of modules should use `import_module()` instead of this
function.

`importlib.import_module(name, package=None)`

    
Import a module. The name argument specifies what module to import in absolute
or relative terms (e.g. either `pkg.mod` or `..mod`). If the name is specified
in relative terms, then the package argument must be set to the name of the
package which is to act as the anchor for resolving the package name (e.g.
`import_module('..mod', 'pkg.subpkg')` will import `pkg.mod`).

The `import_module()` function acts as a simplifying wrapper around
`importlib.__import__()`. This means all semantics of the function are derived
from `importlib.__import__()`. The most important difference between these two
functions is that `import_module()` returns the specified package or module
(e.g. `pkg.mod`), while `__import__()` returns the top-level package or module
(e.g. `pkg`).

If you are dynamically importing a module that was created since the
interpreter began execution (e.g., created a Python source file), you may need
to call `invalidate_caches()` in order for the new module to be noticed by the
import system.

Changed in version 3.3: Parent packages are automatically imported.

`importlib.find_loader(name, path=None)`

    
Find the loader for a module, optionally within the specified path. If the
module is in `sys.modules`, then `sys.modules[name].__loader__` is returned
(unless the loader would be `None` or is not set, in which case `ValueError`
is raised). Otherwise a search using `sys.meta_path` is done. `None` is
returned if no loader is found.

A dotted name does not have its parents implicitly imported as that requires
loading them and that may not be desired. To properly import a submodule you
will need to import all parent packages of the submodule and use the correct
argument to path.

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.4: If `__loader__` is not set, raise `ValueError`, just
like when the attribute is set to `None`.

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use `importlib.util.find_spec()` instead.

`importlib.invalidate_caches()`

    
Invalidate the internal caches of finders stored at `sys.meta_path`. If a
finder implements `invalidate_caches()` then it will be called to perform the
invalidation. This function should be called if any modules are
created/installed while your program is running to guarantee all finders will
notice the new module’s existence.

New in version 3.3.

`importlib.reload(module)`

    
Reload a previously imported module. The argument must be a module object, so
it must have been successfully imported before. This is useful if you have
edited the module source file using an external editor and want to try out the
new version without leaving the Python interpreter. The return value is the
module object (which can be different if re-importing causes a different
object to be placed in `sys.modules`).

When `reload()` is executed:

  * Python module’s code is recompiled and the module-level code re-executed, defining a new set of objects which are bound to names in the module’s dictionary by reusing the loader which originally loaded the module. The `init` function of extension modules is not called a second time.
  * As with all other objects in Python the old objects are only reclaimed after their reference counts drop to zero.
  * The names in the module namespace are updated to point to any new or changed objects.
  * Other references to the old objects (such as names external to the module) are not rebound to refer to the new objects and must be updated in each namespace where they occur if that is desired.

There are a number of other caveats:

When a module is reloaded, its dictionary (containing the module’s global
variables) is retained. Redefinitions of names will override the old
definitions, so this is generally not a problem. If the new version of a
module does not define a name that was defined by the old version, the old
definition remains. This feature can be used to the module’s advantage if it
maintains a global table or cache of objects — with a `try` statement it can
test for the table’s presence and skip its initialization if desired:

    
    try:
        cache
    except NameError:
        cache = {}
    
It is generally not very useful to reload built-in or dynamically loaded
modules. Reloading `sys`, `__main__`, `builtins` and other key modules is not
recommended. In many cases extension modules are not designed to be
initialized more than once, and may fail in arbitrary ways when reloaded.

If a module imports objects from another module using `from` … `import` …,
calling `reload()` for the other module does not redefine the objects imported
from it — one way around this is to re-execute the `from` statement, another
is to use `import` and qualified names (module.name) instead.

If a module instantiates instances of a class, reloading the module that
defines the class does not affect the method definitions of the instances —
they continue to use the old class definition. The same is true for derived
classes.

New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.7: `ModuleNotFoundError` is raised when the module being
reloaded lacks a `ModuleSpec`.

## importlib.abc – Abstract base classes related to import

Source code: Lib/importlib/abc.py

The `importlib.abc` module contains all of the core abstract base classes used
by `import`. Some subclasses of the core abstract base classes are also
provided to help in implementing the core ABCs.

ABC hierarchy:

    
    object
     +-- Finder (deprecated)
     |    +-- MetaPathFinder
     |    +-- PathEntryFinder
     +-- Loader
          +-- ResourceLoader --------+
          +-- InspectLoader          |
               +-- ExecutionLoader --+
                                     +-- FileLoader
                                     +-- SourceLoader
    
`class importlib.abc.Finder`

    
An abstract base class representing a finder.

Deprecated since version 3.3: Use `MetaPathFinder` or `PathEntryFinder`
instead.

`abstractmethod find_module(fullname, path=None)`

    
An abstract method for finding a loader for the specified module. Originally
specified in PEP 302, this method was meant for use in `sys.meta_path` and in
the path-based import subsystem.

Changed in version 3.4: Returns `None` when called instead of raising
`NotImplementedError`.

`class importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder`

    
An abstract base class representing a meta path finder. For compatibility,
this is a subclass of `Finder`.

New in version 3.3.

`find_spec(fullname, path, target=None)`

    
An abstract method for finding a spec for the specified module. If this is a
top-level import, path will be `None`. Otherwise, this is a search for a
subpackage or module and path will be the value of `__path__` from the parent
package. If a spec cannot be found, `None` is returned. When passed in,
`target` is a module object that the finder may use to make a more educated
guess about what spec to return. `importlib.util.spec_from_loader()` may be
useful for implementing concrete `MetaPathFinders`.

New in version 3.4.

`find_module(fullname, path)`

    
A legacy method for finding a loader for the specified module. If this is a
top-level import, path will be `None`. Otherwise, this is a search for a
subpackage or module and path will be the value of `__path__` from the parent
package. If a loader cannot be found, `None` is returned.

If `find_spec()` is defined, backwards-compatible functionality is provided.

Changed in version 3.4: Returns `None` when called instead of raising
`NotImplementedError`. Can use `find_spec()` to provide functionality.

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use `find_spec()` instead.

`invalidate_caches()`

    
An optional method which, when called, should invalidate any internal cache
used by the finder. Used by `importlib.invalidate_caches()` when invalidating
the caches of all finders on `sys.meta_path`.

Changed in version 3.4: Returns `None` when called instead of
`NotImplemented`.

`class importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder`

    
An abstract base class representing a path entry finder. Though it bears some
similarities to `MetaPathFinder`, `PathEntryFinder` is meant for use only
within the path-based import subsystem provided by `PathFinder`. This ABC is a
subclass of `Finder` for compatibility reasons only.

New in version 3.3.

`find_spec(fullname, target=None)`

    
An abstract method for finding a spec for the specified module. The finder
will search for the module only within the path entry to which it is assigned.
If a spec cannot be found, `None` is returned. When passed in, `target` is a
module object that the finder may use to make a more educated guess about what
spec to return. `importlib.util.spec_from_loader()` may be useful for
implementing concrete `PathEntryFinders`.

New in version 3.4.

`find_loader(fullname)`

    
A legacy method for finding a loader for the specified module. Returns a
2-tuple of `(loader, portion)` where `portion` is a sequence of file system
locations contributing to part of a namespace package. The loader may be
`None` while specifying `portion` to signify the contribution of the file
system locations to a namespace package. An empty list can be used for
`portion` to signify the loader is not part of a namespace package. If
`loader` is `None` and `portion` is the empty list then no loader or location
for a namespace package were found (i.e. failure to find anything for the
module).

If `find_spec()` is defined then backwards-compatible functionality is
provided.

Changed in version 3.4: Returns `(None, [])` instead of raising
`NotImplementedError`. Uses `find_spec()` when available to provide
functionality.

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use `find_spec()` instead.

`find_module(fullname)`

    
A concrete implementation of `Finder.find_module()` which is equivalent to
`self.find_loader(fullname)[0]`.

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use `find_spec()` instead.

`invalidate_caches()`

    
An optional method which, when called, should invalidate any internal cache
used by the finder. Used by `PathFinder.invalidate_caches()` when invalidating
the caches of all cached finders.

`class importlib.abc.Loader`

    
An abstract base class for a loader. See PEP 302 for the exact definition for
a loader.

Loaders that wish to support resource reading should implement a
`get_resource_reader(fullname)` method as specified by
`importlib.abc.ResourceReader`.

Changed in version 3.7: Introduced the optional `get_resource_reader()`
method.

`create_module(spec)`

    
A method that returns the module object to use when importing a module. This
method may return `None`, indicating that default module creation semantics
should take place.

New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.5: Starting in Python 3.6, this method will not be
optional when `exec_module()` is defined.

`exec_module(module)`

    
An abstract method that executes the module in its own namespace when a module
is imported or reloaded. The module should already be initialized when
`exec_module()` is called. When this method exists, `create_module()` must be
defined.

New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.6: `create_module()` must also be defined.

`load_module(fullname)`

    
A legacy method for loading a module. If the module cannot be loaded,
`ImportError` is raised, otherwise the loaded module is returned.

If the requested module already exists in `sys.modules`, that module should be
used and reloaded. Otherwise the loader should create a new module and insert
it into `sys.modules` before any loading begins, to prevent recursion from the
import. If the loader inserted a module and the load fails, it must be removed
by the loader from `sys.modules`; modules already in `sys.modules` before the
loader began execution should be left alone (see
`importlib.util.module_for_loader()`).

The loader should set several attributes on the module. (Note that some of
these attributes can change when a module is reloaded):

  * `__name__`
    
The name of the module.

  * `__file__`
    
The path to where the module data is stored (not set for built-in modules).

  * `__cached__`
    
The path to where a compiled version of the module is/should be stored (not
set when the attribute would be inappropriate).

  * `__path__`
    
A list of strings specifying the search path within a package. This attribute
is not set on modules.

  * `__package__`
    
The fully-qualified name of the package under which the module was loaded as a
submodule (or the empty string for top-level modules). For packages, it is the
same as `__name__`. The `importlib.util.module_for_loader()` decorator can
handle the details for `__package__`.

  * `__loader__`
    
The loader used to load the module. The `importlib.util.module_for_loader()`
decorator can handle the details for `__package__`.

When `exec_module()` is available then backwards-compatible functionality is
provided.

Changed in version 3.4: Raise `ImportError` when called instead of
`NotImplementedError`. Functionality provided when `exec_module()` is
available.

Deprecated since version 3.4: The recommended API for loading a module is
`exec_module()` (and `create_module()`). Loaders should implement it instead
of load_module(). The import machinery takes care of all the other
responsibilities of load_module() when exec_module() is implemented.

`module_repr(module)`

    
A legacy method which when implemented calculates and returns the given
module’s repr, as a string. The module type’s default repr() will use the
result of this method as appropriate.

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.4: Made optional instead of an abstractmethod.

Deprecated since version 3.4: The import machinery now takes care of this
automatically.

`class importlib.abc.ResourceReader`

    
Superseded by TraversableReader

An abstract base class to provide the ability to read resources.

From the perspective of this ABC, a resource is a binary artifact that is
shipped within a package. Typically this is something like a data file that
lives next to the `__init__.py` file of the package. The purpose of this class
is to help abstract out the accessing of such data files so that it does not
matter if the package and its data file(s) are stored in a e.g. zip file
versus on the file system.

For any of methods of this class, a resource argument is expected to be a
path-like object which represents conceptually just a file name. This means
that no subdirectory paths should be included in the resource argument. This
is because the location of the package the reader is for, acts as the
“directory”. Hence the metaphor for directories and file names is packages and
resources, respectively. This is also why instances of this class are expected
to directly correlate to a specific package (instead of potentially
representing multiple packages or a module).

Loaders that wish to support resource reading are expected to provide a method
called `get_resource_reader(fullname)` which returns an object implementing
this ABC’s interface. If the module specified by fullname is not a package,
this method should return `None`. An object compatible with this ABC should
only be returned when the specified module is a package.

New in version 3.7.

`abstractmethod open_resource(resource)`

    
Returns an opened, file-like object for binary reading of the resource.

If the resource cannot be found, `FileNotFoundError` is raised.

`abstractmethod resource_path(resource)`

    
Returns the file system path to the resource.

If the resource does not concretely exist on the file system, raise
`FileNotFoundError`.

`abstractmethod is_resource(name)`

    
Returns `True` if the named name is considered a resource. `FileNotFoundError`
is raised if name does not exist.

`abstractmethod contents()`

    
Returns an iterable of strings over the contents of the package. Do note that
it is not required that all names returned by the iterator be actual
resources, e.g. it is acceptable to return names for which `is_resource()`
would be false.

Allowing non-resource names to be returned is to allow for situations where
how a package and its resources are stored are known a priori and the non-
resource names would be useful. For instance, returning subdirectory names is
allowed so that when it is known that the package and resources are stored on
the file system then those subdirectory names can be used directly.

The abstract method returns an iterable of no items.

`class importlib.abc.ResourceLoader`

    
An abstract base class for a loader which implements the optional PEP 302
protocol for loading arbitrary resources from the storage back-end.

Deprecated since version 3.7: This ABC is deprecated in favour of supporting
resource loading through `importlib.abc.ResourceReader`.

`abstractmethod get_data(path)`

    
An abstract method to return the bytes for the data located at path. Loaders
that have a file-like storage back-end that allows storing arbitrary data can
implement this abstract method to give direct access to the data stored.
`OSError` is to be raised if the path cannot be found. The path is expected to
be constructed using a module’s `__file__` attribute or an item from a
package’s `__path__`.

Changed in version 3.4: Raises `OSError` instead of `NotImplementedError`.

`class importlib.abc.InspectLoader`

    
An abstract base class for a loader which implements the optional PEP 302
protocol for loaders that inspect modules.

`get_code(fullname)`

    
Return the code object for a module, or `None` if the module does not have a
code object (as would be the case, for example, for a built-in module). Raise
an `ImportError` if loader cannot find the requested module.

Note

While the method has a default implementation, it is suggested that it be
overridden if possible for performance.

Changed in version 3.4: No longer abstract and a concrete implementation is
provided.

`abstractmethod get_source(fullname)`

    
An abstract method to return the source of a module. It is returned as a text
string using universal newlines, translating all recognized line separators
into `'\n'` characters. Returns `None` if no source is available (e.g. a
built-in module). Raises `ImportError` if the loader cannot find the module
specified.

Changed in version 3.4: Raises `ImportError` instead of `NotImplementedError`.

`is_package(fullname)`

    
An abstract method to return a true value if the module is a package, a false
value otherwise. `ImportError` is raised if the loader cannot find the module.

Changed in version 3.4: Raises `ImportError` instead of `NotImplementedError`.

`static source_to_code(data, path='<string>')`

    
Create a code object from Python source.

The data argument can be whatever the `compile()` function supports (i.e.
string or bytes). The path argument should be the “path” to where the source
code originated from, which can be an abstract concept (e.g. location in a zip
file).

With the subsequent code object one can execute it in a module by running
`exec(code, module.__dict__)`.

New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.5: Made the method static.

`exec_module(module)`

    
Implementation of `Loader.exec_module()`.

New in version 3.4.

`load_module(fullname)`

    
Implementation of `Loader.load_module()`.

Deprecated since version 3.4: use `exec_module()` instead.

`class importlib.abc.ExecutionLoader`

    
An abstract base class which inherits from `InspectLoader` that, when
implemented, helps a module to be executed as a script. The ABC represents an
optional PEP 302 protocol.

`abstractmethod get_filename(fullname)`

    
An abstract method that is to return the value of `__file__` for the specified
module. If no path is available, `ImportError` is raised.

If source code is available, then the method should return the path to the
source file, regardless of whether a bytecode was used to load the module.

Changed in version 3.4: Raises `ImportError` instead of `NotImplementedError`.

`class importlib.abc.FileLoader(fullname, path)`

    
An abstract base class which inherits from `ResourceLoader` and
`ExecutionLoader`, providing concrete implementations of
`ResourceLoader.get_data()` and `ExecutionLoader.get_filename()`.

The fullname argument is a fully resolved name of the module the loader is to
handle. The path argument is the path to the file for the module.

New in version 3.3.

`name`

    
The name of the module the loader can handle.

`path`

    
Path to the file of the module.

`load_module(fullname)`

    
Calls super’s `load_module()`.

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use `Loader.exec_module()` instead.

`abstractmethod get_filename(fullname)`

    
Returns `path`.

`abstractmethod get_data(path)`

    
Reads path as a binary file and returns the bytes from it.

`class importlib.abc.SourceLoader`

    
An abstract base class for implementing source (and optionally bytecode) file
loading. The class inherits from both `ResourceLoader` and `ExecutionLoader`,
requiring the implementation of:

  * `ResourceLoader.get_data()`
  * `ExecutionLoader.get_filename()`
    
Should only return the path to the source file; sourceless loading is not
supported.

The abstract methods defined by this class are to add optional bytecode file
support. Not implementing these optional methods (or causing them to raise
`NotImplementedError`) causes the loader to only work with source code.
Implementing the methods allows the loader to work with source and bytecode
files; it does not allow for sourceless loading where only bytecode is
provided. Bytecode files are an optimization to speed up loading by removing
the parsing step of Python’s compiler, and so no bytecode-specific API is
exposed.

`path_stats(path)`

    
Optional abstract method which returns a `dict` containing metadata about the
specified path. Supported dictionary keys are:

  * `'mtime'` (mandatory): an integer or floating-point number representing the modification time of the source code;
  * `'size'` (optional): the size in bytes of the source code.

Any other keys in the dictionary are ignored, to allow for future extensions.
If the path cannot be handled, `OSError` is raised.

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.4: Raise `OSError` instead of `NotImplementedError`.

`path_mtime(path)`

    
Optional abstract method which returns the modification time for the specified
path.

Deprecated since version 3.3: This method is deprecated in favour of
`path_stats()`. You don’t have to implement it, but it is still available for
compatibility purposes. Raise `OSError` if the path cannot be handled.

Changed in version 3.4: Raise `OSError` instead of `NotImplementedError`.

`set_data(path, data)`

    
Optional abstract method which writes the specified bytes to a file path. Any
intermediate directories which do not exist are to be created automatically.

When writing to the path fails because the path is read-only
(`errno.EACCES`/`PermissionError`), do not propagate the exception.

Changed in version 3.4: No longer raises `NotImplementedError` when called.

`get_code(fullname)`

    
Concrete implementation of `InspectLoader.get_code()`.

`exec_module(module)`

    
Concrete implementation of `Loader.exec_module()`.

New in version 3.4.

`load_module(fullname)`

    
Concrete implementation of `Loader.load_module()`.

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use `exec_module()` instead.

`get_source(fullname)`

    
Concrete implementation of `InspectLoader.get_source()`.

`is_package(fullname)`

    
Concrete implementation of `InspectLoader.is_package()`. A module is
determined to be a package if its file path (as provided by
`ExecutionLoader.get_filename()`) is a file named `__init__` when the file
extension is removed and the module name itself does not end in `__init__`.

`class importlib.abc.Traversable`

    
An object with a subset of pathlib.Path methods suitable for traversing
directories and opening files.

New in version 3.9.

`class importlib.abc.TraversableReader`

    
An abstract base class for resource readers capable of serving the `files`
interface. Subclasses ResourceReader and provides concrete implementations of
the ResourceReader’s abstract methods. Therefore, any loader supplying
TraversableReader also supplies ResourceReader.

New in version 3.9.

## importlib.resources – Resources

Source code: Lib/importlib/resources.py

New in version 3.7.

This module leverages Python’s import system to provide access to resources
within packages. If you can import a package, you can access resources within
that package. Resources can be opened or read, in either binary or text mode.

Resources are roughly akin to files inside directories, though it’s important
to keep in mind that this is just a metaphor. Resources and packages do not
have to exist as physical files and directories on the file system.

Note

This module provides functionality similar to pkg_resources Basic Resource
Access without the performance overhead of that package. This makes reading
resources included in packages easier, with more stable and consistent
semantics.

The standalone backport of this module provides more information on using
importlib.resources and migrating from pkg_resources to importlib.resources.

Loaders that wish to support resource reading should implement a
`get_resource_reader(fullname)` method as specified by
`importlib.abc.ResourceReader`.

The following types are defined.

`importlib.resources.Package`

    
The `Package` type is defined as `Union[str, ModuleType]`. This means that
where the function describes accepting a `Package`, you can pass in either a
string or a module. Module objects must have a resolvable
`__spec__.submodule_search_locations` that is not `None`.

`importlib.resources.Resource`

    
This type describes the resource names passed into the various functions in
this package. This is defined as `Union[str, os.PathLike]`.

The following functions are available.

`importlib.resources.files(package)`

    
Returns an `importlib.resources.abc.Traversable` object representing the
resource container for the package (think directory) and its resources (think
files). A Traversable may contain other containers (think subdirectories).

package is either a name or a module object which conforms to the `Package`
requirements.

New in version 3.9.

`importlib.resources.as_file(traversable)`

    
Given a `importlib.resources.abc.Traversable` object representing a file,
typically from `importlib.resources.files()`, return a context manager for use
in a `with` statement. The context manager provides a `pathlib.Path` object.

Exiting the context manager cleans up any temporary file created when the
resource was extracted from e.g. a zip file.

Use `as_file` when the Traversable methods (`read_text`, etc) are insufficient
and an actual file on the file system is required.

New in version 3.9.

`importlib.resources.open_binary(package, resource)`

    
Open for binary reading the resource within package.

package is either a name or a module object which conforms to the `Package`
requirements. resource is the name of the resource to open within package; it
may not contain path separators and it may not have sub-resources (i.e. it
cannot be a directory). This function returns a `typing.BinaryIO` instance, a
binary I/O stream open for reading.

`importlib.resources.open_text(package, resource, encoding='utf-8',
errors='strict')`

    
Open for text reading the resource within package. By default, the resource is
opened for reading as UTF-8.

package is either a name or a module object which conforms to the `Package`
requirements. resource is the name of the resource to open within package; it
may not contain path separators and it may not have sub-resources (i.e. it
cannot be a directory). encoding and errors have the same meaning as with
built-in `open()`.

This function returns a `typing.TextIO` instance, a text I/O stream open for
reading.

`importlib.resources.read_binary(package, resource)`

    
Read and return the contents of the resource within package as `bytes`.

package is either a name or a module object which conforms to the `Package`
requirements. resource is the name of the resource to open within package; it
may not contain path separators and it may not have sub-resources (i.e. it
cannot be a directory). This function returns the contents of the resource as
`bytes`.

`importlib.resources.read_text(package, resource, encoding='utf-8',
errors='strict')`

    
Read and return the contents of resource within package as a `str`. By
default, the contents are read as strict UTF-8.

package is either a name or a module object which conforms to the `Package`
requirements. resource is the name of the resource to open within package; it
may not contain path separators and it may not have sub-resources (i.e. it
cannot be a directory). encoding and errors have the same meaning as with
built-in `open()`. This function returns the contents of the resource as
`str`.

`importlib.resources.path(package, resource)`

    
Return the path to the resource as an actual file system path. This function
returns a context manager for use in a `with` statement. The context manager
provides a `pathlib.Path` object.

Exiting the context manager cleans up any temporary file created when the
resource needs to be extracted from e.g. a zip file.

package is either a name or a module object which conforms to the `Package`
requirements. resource is the name of the resource to open within package; it
may not contain path separators and it may not have sub-resources (i.e. it
cannot be a directory).

`importlib.resources.is_resource(package, name)`

    
Return `True` if there is a resource named name in the package, otherwise
`False`. Remember that directories are not resources! package is either a name
or a module object which conforms to the `Package` requirements.

`importlib.resources.contents(package)`

    
Return an iterable over the named items within the package. The iterable
returns `str` resources (e.g. files) and non-resources (e.g. directories). The
iterable does not recurse into subdirectories.

package is either a name or a module object which conforms to the `Package`
requirements.

## importlib.machinery – Importers and path hooks

Source code: Lib/importlib/machinery.py

This module contains the various objects that help `import` find and load
modules.

`importlib.machinery.SOURCE_SUFFIXES`

    
A list of strings representing the recognized file suffixes for source
modules.

New in version 3.3.

`importlib.machinery.DEBUG_BYTECODE_SUFFIXES`

    
A list of strings representing the file suffixes for non-optimized bytecode
modules.

New in version 3.3.

Deprecated since version 3.5: Use `BYTECODE_SUFFIXES` instead.

`importlib.machinery.OPTIMIZED_BYTECODE_SUFFIXES`

    
A list of strings representing the file suffixes for optimized bytecode
modules.

New in version 3.3.

Deprecated since version 3.5: Use `BYTECODE_SUFFIXES` instead.

`importlib.machinery.BYTECODE_SUFFIXES`

    
A list of strings representing the recognized file suffixes for bytecode
modules (including the leading dot).

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.5: The value is no longer dependent on `__debug__`.

`importlib.machinery.EXTENSION_SUFFIXES`

    
A list of strings representing the recognized file suffixes for extension
modules.

New in version 3.3.

`importlib.machinery.all_suffixes()`

    
Returns a combined list of strings representing all file suffixes for modules
recognized by the standard import machinery. This is a helper for code which
simply needs to know if a filesystem path potentially refers to a module
without needing any details on the kind of module (for example,
`inspect.getmodulename()`).

New in version 3.3.

`class importlib.machinery.BuiltinImporter`

    
An importer for built-in modules. All known built-in modules are listed in
`sys.builtin_module_names`. This class implements the
`importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder` and `importlib.abc.InspectLoader` ABCs.

Only class methods are defined by this class to alleviate the need for
instantiation.

Changed in version 3.5: As part of PEP 489, the builtin importer now
implements `Loader.create_module()` and `Loader.exec_module()`

`class importlib.machinery.FrozenImporter`

    
An importer for frozen modules. This class implements the
`importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder` and `importlib.abc.InspectLoader` ABCs.

Only class methods are defined by this class to alleviate the need for
instantiation.

Changed in version 3.4: Gained `create_module()` and `exec_module()` methods.

`class importlib.machinery.WindowsRegistryFinder`

    
Finder for modules declared in the Windows registry. This class implements the
`importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder` ABC.

Only class methods are defined by this class to alleviate the need for
instantiation.

New in version 3.3.

Deprecated since version 3.6: Use `site` configuration instead. Future
versions of Python may not enable this finder by default.

`class importlib.machinery.PathFinder`

    
A Finder for `sys.path` and package `__path__` attributes. This class
implements the `importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder` ABC.

Only class methods are defined by this class to alleviate the need for
instantiation.

`classmethod find_spec(fullname, path=None, target=None)`

    
Class method that attempts to find a spec for the module specified by fullname
on `sys.path` or, if defined, on path. For each path entry that is searched,
`sys.path_importer_cache` is checked. If a non-false object is found then it
is used as the path entry finder to look for the module being searched for. If
no entry is found in `sys.path_importer_cache`, then `sys.path_hooks` is
searched for a finder for the path entry and, if found, is stored in
`sys.path_importer_cache` along with being queried about the module. If no
finder is ever found then `None` is both stored in the cache and returned.

New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.5: If the current working directory – represented by an
empty string – is no longer valid then `None` is returned but no value is
cached in `sys.path_importer_cache`.

`classmethod find_module(fullname, path=None)`

    
A legacy wrapper around `find_spec()`.

Deprecated since version 3.4: Use `find_spec()` instead.

`classmethod invalidate_caches()`

    
Calls `importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder.invalidate_caches()` on all finders
stored in `sys.path_importer_cache` that define the method. Otherwise entries
in `sys.path_importer_cache` set to `None` are deleted.

Changed in version 3.7: Entries of `None` in `sys.path_importer_cache` are
deleted.

Changed in version 3.4: Calls objects in `sys.path_hooks` with the current
working directory for `''` (i.e. the empty string).

`class importlib.machinery.FileFinder(path, *loader_details)`

    
A concrete implementation of `importlib.abc.PathEntryFinder` which caches
results from the file system.

The path argument is the directory for which the finder is in charge of
searching.

The loader_details argument is a variable number of 2-item tuples each
containing a loader and a sequence of file suffixes the loader recognizes. The
loaders are expected to be callables which accept two arguments of the
module’s name and the path to the file found.

The finder will cache the directory contents as necessary, making stat calls
for each module search to verify the cache is not outdated. Because cache
staleness relies upon the granularity of the operating system’s state
information of the file system, there is a potential race condition of
searching for a module, creating a new file, and then searching for the module
the new file represents. If the operations happen fast enough to fit within
the granularity of stat calls, then the module search will fail. To prevent
this from happening, when you create a module dynamically, make sure to call
`importlib.invalidate_caches()`.

New in version 3.3.

`path`

    
The path the finder will search in.

`find_spec(fullname, target=None)`

    
Attempt to find the spec to handle fullname within `path`.

New in version 3.4.

`find_loader(fullname)`

    
Attempt to find the loader to handle fullname within `path`.

`invalidate_caches()`

    
Clear out the internal cache.

`classmethod path_hook(*loader_details)`

    
A class method which returns a closure for use on `sys.path_hooks`. An
instance of `FileFinder` is returned by the closure using the path argument
given to the closure directly and loader_details indirectly.

If the argument to the closure is not an existing directory, `ImportError` is
raised.

`class importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader(fullname, path)`

    
A concrete implementation of `importlib.abc.SourceLoader` by subclassing
`importlib.abc.FileLoader` and providing some concrete implementations of
other methods.

New in version 3.3.

`name`

    
The name of the module that this loader will handle.

`path`

    
The path to the source file.

`is_package(fullname)`

    
Return `True` if `path` appears to be for a package.

`path_stats(path)`

    
Concrete implementation of `importlib.abc.SourceLoader.path_stats()`.

`set_data(path, data)`

    
Concrete implementation of `importlib.abc.SourceLoader.set_data()`.

`load_module(name=None)`

    
Concrete implementation of `importlib.abc.Loader.load_module()` where
specifying the name of the module to load is optional.

Deprecated since version 3.6: Use `importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module()`
instead.

`class importlib.machinery.SourcelessFileLoader(fullname, path)`

    
A concrete implementation of `importlib.abc.FileLoader` which can import
bytecode files (i.e. no source code files exist).

Please note that direct use of bytecode files (and thus not source code files)
inhibits your modules from being usable by all Python implementations or new
versions of Python which change the bytecode format.

New in version 3.3.

`name`

    
The name of the module the loader will handle.

`path`

    
The path to the bytecode file.

`is_package(fullname)`

    
Determines if the module is a package based on `path`.

`get_code(fullname)`

    
Returns the code object for `name` created from `path`.

`get_source(fullname)`

    
Returns `None` as bytecode files have no source when this loader is used.

`load_module(name=None)`

Concrete implementation of `importlib.abc.Loader.load_module()` where
specifying the name of the module to load is optional.

Deprecated since version 3.6: Use `importlib.abc.Loader.exec_module()`
instead.

`class importlib.machinery.ExtensionFileLoader(fullname, path)`

    
A concrete implementation of `importlib.abc.ExecutionLoader` for extension
modules.

The fullname argument specifies the name of the module the loader is to
support. The path argument is the path to the extension module’s file.

New in version 3.3.

`name`

    
Name of the module the loader supports.

`path`

    
Path to the extension module.

`create_module(spec)`

    
Creates the module object from the given specification in accordance with PEP
489.

New in version 3.5.

`exec_module(module)`

    
Initializes the given module object in accordance with PEP 489.

New in version 3.5.

`is_package(fullname)`

    
Returns `True` if the file path points to a package’s `__init__` module based
on `EXTENSION_SUFFIXES`.

`get_code(fullname)`

    
Returns `None` as extension modules lack a code object.

`get_source(fullname)`

    
Returns `None` as extension modules do not have source code.

`get_filename(fullname)`

    
Returns `path`.

New in version 3.4.

`class importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec(name, loader, *, origin=None,
loader_state=None, is_package=None)`

    
A specification for a module’s import-system-related state. This is typically
exposed as the module’s `__spec__` attribute. In the descriptions below, the
names in parentheses give the corresponding attribute available directly on
the module object. E.g. `module.__spec__.origin == module.__file__`. Note
however that while the values are usually equivalent, they can differ since
there is no synchronization between the two objects. Thus it is possible to
update the module’s `__path__` at runtime, and this will not be automatically
reflected in `__spec__.submodule_search_locations`.

New in version 3.4.

`name`

(`__name__`)

A string for the fully-qualified name of the module.

`loader`

(`__loader__`)

The Loader that should be used when loading the module. Finders should always
set this.

`origin`

(`__file__`)

Name of the place from which the module is loaded, e.g. “builtin” for built-in
modules and the filename for modules loaded from source. Normally “origin”
should be set, but it may be `None` (the default) which indicates it is
unspecified (e.g. for namespace packages).

`submodule_search_locations`

(`__path__`)

List of strings for where to find submodules, if a package (`None` otherwise).

`loader_state`

Container of extra module-specific data for use during loading (or `None`).

`cached`

(`__cached__`)

String for where the compiled module should be stored (or `None`).

`parent`

(`__package__`)

(Read-only) The fully-qualified name of the package under which the module
should be loaded as a submodule (or the empty string for top-level modules).
For packages, it is the same as `__name__`.

`has_location`

Boolean indicating whether or not the module’s “origin” attribute refers to a
loadable location.

## importlib.util – Utility code for importers

Source code: Lib/importlib/util.py

This module contains the various objects that help in the construction of an
importer.

`importlib.util.MAGIC_NUMBER`

    
The bytes which represent the bytecode version number. If you need help with
loading/writing bytecode then consider `importlib.abc.SourceLoader`.

New in version 3.4.

`importlib.util.cache_from_source(path, debug_override=None, *,
optimization=None)`

    
Return the PEP 3147/PEP 488 path to the byte-compiled file associated with the
source path. For example, if path is `/foo/bar/baz.py` the return value would
be `/foo/bar/__pycache__/baz.cpython-32.pyc` for Python 3.2. The `cpython-32`
string comes from the current magic tag (see `get_tag()`; if
`sys.implementation.cache_tag` is not defined then `NotImplementedError` will
be raised).

The optimization parameter is used to specify the optimization level of the
bytecode file. An empty string represents no optimization, so
`/foo/bar/baz.py` with an optimization of `''` will result in a bytecode path
of `/foo/bar/__pycache__/baz.cpython-32.pyc`. `None` causes the interpreter’s
optimization level to be used. Any other value’s string representation is
used, so `/foo/bar/baz.py` with an optimization of `2` will lead to the
bytecode path of `/foo/bar/__pycache__/baz.cpython-32.opt-2.pyc`. The string
representation of optimization can only be alphanumeric, else `ValueError` is
raised.

The debug_override parameter is deprecated and can be used to override the
system’s value for `__debug__`. A `True` value is the equivalent of setting
optimization to the empty string. A `False` value is the same as setting
optimization to `1`. If both debug_override an optimization are not `None`
then `TypeError` is raised.

New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.5: The optimization parameter was added and the
debug_override parameter was deprecated.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`importlib.util.source_from_cache(path)`

    
Given the path to a PEP 3147 file name, return the associated source code file
path. For example, if path is `/foo/bar/__pycache__/baz.cpython-32.pyc` the
returned path would be `/foo/bar/baz.py`. path need not exist, however if it
does not conform to PEP 3147 or PEP 488 format, a `ValueError` is raised. If
`sys.implementation.cache_tag` is not defined, `NotImplementedError` is
raised.

New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`importlib.util.decode_source(source_bytes)`

    
Decode the given bytes representing source code and return it as a string with
universal newlines (as required by
`importlib.abc.InspectLoader.get_source()`).

New in version 3.4.

`importlib.util.resolve_name(name, package)`

    
Resolve a relative module name to an absolute one.

If name has no leading dots, then name is simply returned. This allows for
usage such as `importlib.util.resolve_name('sys', __spec__.parent)` without
doing a check to see if the package argument is needed.

`ImportError` is raised if name is a relative module name but package is a
false value (e.g. `None` or the empty string). `ImportError` is also raised a
relative name would escape its containing package (e.g. requesting `..bacon`
from within the `spam` package).

New in version 3.3.

Changed in version 3.9: To improve consistency with import statements, raise
`ImportError` instead of `ValueError` for invalid relative import attempts.

`importlib.util.find_spec(name, package=None)`

    
Find the spec for a module, optionally relative to the specified package name.
If the module is in `sys.modules`, then `sys.modules[name].__spec__` is
returned (unless the spec would be `None` or is not set, in which case
`ValueError` is raised). Otherwise a search using `sys.meta_path` is done.
`None` is returned if no spec is found.

If name is for a submodule (contains a dot), the parent module is
automatically imported.

name and package work the same as for `import_module()`.

New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.7: Raises `ModuleNotFoundError` instead of
`AttributeError` if package is in fact not a package (i.e. lacks a `__path__`
attribute).

`importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)`

    
Create a new module based on spec and `spec.loader.create_module`.

If `spec.loader.create_module` does not return `None`, then any pre-existing
attributes will not be reset. Also, no `AttributeError` will be raised if
triggered while accessing spec or setting an attribute on the module.

This function is preferred over using `types.ModuleType` to create a new
module as spec is used to set as many import-controlled attributes on the
module as possible.

New in version 3.5.

`@importlib.util.module_for_loader`

    
A decorator for `importlib.abc.Loader.load_module()` to handle selecting the
proper module object to load with. The decorated method is expected to have a
call signature taking two positional arguments (e.g. `load_module(self,
module)`) for which the second argument will be the module object to be used
by the loader. Note that the decorator will not work on static methods because
of the assumption of two arguments.

The decorated method will take in the name of the module to be loaded as
expected for a loader. If the module is not found in `sys.modules` then a new
one is constructed. Regardless of where the module came from, `__loader__` set
to self and `__package__` is set based on what
`importlib.abc.InspectLoader.is_package()` returns (if available). These
attributes are set unconditionally to support reloading.

If an exception is raised by the decorated method and a module was added to
`sys.modules`, then the module will be removed to prevent a partially
initialized module from being in left in `sys.modules`. If the module was
already in `sys.modules` then it is left alone.

Changed in version 3.3: `__loader__` and `__package__` are automatically set
(when possible).

Changed in version 3.4: Set `__name__`, `__loader__` `__package__`
unconditionally to support reloading.

Deprecated since version 3.4: The import machinery now directly performs all
the functionality provided by this function.

`@importlib.util.set_loader`

    
A decorator for `importlib.abc.Loader.load_module()` to set the `__loader__`
attribute on the returned module. If the attribute is already set the
decorator does nothing. It is assumed that the first positional argument to
the wrapped method (i.e. `self`) is what `__loader__` should be set to.

Changed in version 3.4: Set `__loader__` if set to `None`, as if the attribute
does not exist.

Deprecated since version 3.4: The import machinery takes care of this
automatically.

`@importlib.util.set_package`

    
A decorator for `importlib.abc.Loader.load_module()` to set the `__package__`
attribute on the returned module. If `__package__` is set and has a value
other than `None` it will not be changed.

Deprecated since version 3.4: The import machinery takes care of this
automatically.

`importlib.util.spec_from_loader(name, loader, *, origin=None,
is_package=None)`

    
A factory function for creating a `ModuleSpec` instance based on a loader. The
parameters have the same meaning as they do for ModuleSpec. The function uses
available loader APIs, such as `InspectLoader.is_package()`, to fill in any
missing information on the spec.

New in version 3.4.

`importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(name, location, *, loader=None,
submodule_search_locations=None)`

    
A factory function for creating a `ModuleSpec` instance based on the path to a
file. Missing information will be filled in on the spec by making use of
loader APIs and by the implication that the module will be file-based.

New in version 3.4.

Changed in version 3.6: Accepts a path-like object.

`importlib.util.source_hash(source_bytes)`

    
Return the hash of source_bytes as bytes. A hash-based `.pyc` file embeds the
`source_hash()` of the corresponding source file’s contents in its header.

New in version 3.7.

`class importlib.util.LazyLoader(loader)`

    
A class which postpones the execution of the loader of a module until the
module has an attribute accessed.

This class only works with loaders that define `exec_module()` as control over
what module type is used for the module is required. For those same reasons,
the loader’s `create_module()` method must return `None` or a type for which
its `__class__` attribute can be mutated along with not using slots. Finally,
modules which substitute the object placed into `sys.modules` will not work as
there is no way to properly replace the module references throughout the
interpreter safely; `ValueError` is raised if such a substitution is detected.

Note

For projects where startup time is critical, this class allows for potentially
minimizing the cost of loading a module if it is never used. For projects
where startup time is not essential then use of this class is heavily
discouraged due to error messages created during loading being postponed and
thus occurring out of context.

New in version 3.5.

Changed in version 3.6: Began calling `create_module()`, removing the
compatibility warning for `importlib.machinery.BuiltinImporter` and
`importlib.machinery.ExtensionFileLoader`.

`classmethod factory(loader)`

    
A static method which returns a callable that creates a lazy loader. This is
meant to be used in situations where the loader is passed by class instead of
by instance.

    
    suffixes = importlib.machinery.SOURCE_SUFFIXES
    loader = importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader
    lazy_loader = importlib.util.LazyLoader.factory(loader)
    finder = importlib.machinery.FileFinder(path, (lazy_loader, suffixes))
    
## Examples

### Importing programmatically

To programmatically import a module, use `importlib.import_module()`.

    
    import importlib
    
    itertools = importlib.import_module('itertools')
    
### Checking if a module can be imported

If you need to find out if a module can be imported without actually doing the
import, then you should use `importlib.util.find_spec()`.

    
    import importlib.util
    import sys
    
    # For illustrative purposes.
    name = 'itertools'
    
    if name in sys.modules:
        print(f"{name!r} already in sys.modules")
    elif (spec := importlib.util.find_spec(name)) is not None:
        # If you chose to perform the actual import ...
        module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
        sys.modules[name] = module
        spec.loader.exec_module(module)
        print(f"{name!r} has been imported")
    else:
        print(f"can't find the {name!r} module")
    
### Importing a source file directly

To import a Python source file directly, use the following recipe (Python 3.5
and newer only):

    
    import importlib.util
    import sys
    
    # For illustrative purposes.
    import tokenize
    file_path = tokenize.__file__
    module_name = tokenize.__name__
    
    spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(module_name, file_path)
    module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
    sys.modules[module_name] = module
    spec.loader.exec_module(module)
    
### Setting up an importer

For deep customizations of import, you typically want to implement an
importer. This means managing both the finder and loader side of things. For
finders there are two flavours to choose from depending on your needs: a meta
path finder or a path entry finder. The former is what you would put on
`sys.meta_path` while the latter is what you create using a path entry hook on
`sys.path_hooks` which works with `sys.path` entries to potentially create a
finder. This example will show you how to register your own importers so that
import will use them (for creating an importer for yourself, read the
documentation for the appropriate classes defined within this package):

    
    import importlib.machinery
    import sys
    
    # For illustrative purposes only.
    SpamMetaPathFinder = importlib.machinery.PathFinder
    SpamPathEntryFinder = importlib.machinery.FileFinder
    loader_details = (importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader,
                      importlib.machinery.SOURCE_SUFFIXES)
    
    # Setting up a meta path finder.
    # Make sure to put the finder in the proper location in the list in terms of
    # priority.
    sys.meta_path.append(SpamMetaPathFinder)
    
    # Setting up a path entry finder.
    # Make sure to put the path hook in the proper location in the list in terms
    # of priority.
    sys.path_hooks.append(SpamPathEntryFinder.path_hook(loader_details))
    
### Approximating `importlib.import_module()`

Import itself is implemented in Python code, making it possible to expose most
of the import machinery through importlib. The following helps illustrate the
various APIs that importlib exposes by providing an approximate implementation
of `importlib.import_module()` (Python 3.4 and newer for the importlib usage,
Python 3.6 and newer for other parts of the code).

    
    import importlib.util
    import sys
    
    def import_module(name, package=None):
        """An approximate implementation of import."""
        absolute_name = importlib.util.resolve_name(name, package)
        try:
            return sys.modules[absolute_name]
        except KeyError:
            pass
    
        path = None
        if '.' in absolute_name:
            parent_name, _, child_name = absolute_name.rpartition('.')
            parent_module = import_module(parent_name)
            path = parent_module.__spec__.submodule_search_locations
        for finder in sys.meta_path:
            spec = finder.find_spec(absolute_name, path)
            if spec is not None:
                break
        else:
