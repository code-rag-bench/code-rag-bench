# email.iterators: Iterators

Source code: Lib/email/iterators.py

Iterating over a message object tree is fairly easy with the `Message.walk`
method. The `email.iterators` module provides some useful higher level
iterations over message object trees.

`email.iterators.body_line_iterator(msg, decode=False)`

    
This iterates over all the payloads in all the subparts of msg, returning the
string payloads line-by-line. It skips over all the subpart headers, and it
skips over any subpart with a payload that isn’t a Python string. This is
somewhat equivalent to reading the flat text representation of the message
from a file using `readline()`, skipping over all the intervening headers.

Optional decode is passed through to `Message.get_payload`.

`email.iterators.typed_subpart_iterator(msg, maintype='text', subtype=None)`

    
This iterates over all the subparts of msg, returning only those subparts that
match the MIME type specified by maintype and subtype.

Note that subtype is optional; if omitted, then subpart MIME type matching is
done only with the main type. maintype is optional too; it defaults to text.

Thus, by default `typed_subpart_iterator()` returns each subpart that has a
MIME type of text/*.

The following function has been added as a useful debugging tool. It should
not be considered part of the supported public interface for the package.

`email.iterators._structure(msg, fp=None, level=0, include_default=False)`

    
Prints an indented representation of the content types of the message object
structure. For example:

    
    >>> msg = email.message_from_file(somefile)
    >>> _structure(msg)
    multipart/mixed
        text/plain
        text/plain
        multipart/digest
            message/rfc822
                text/plain
            message/rfc822
                text/plain
            message/rfc822
                text/plain
            message/rfc822
                text/plain
            message/rfc822
                text/plain
        text/plain
    
Optional fp is a file-like object to print the output to. It must be suitable
for Python’s `print()` function. level is used internally. include_default, if
true, prints the default type as well.
