# ftplib — FTP protocol client

Source code: Lib/ftplib.py

This module defines the class `FTP` and a few related items. The `FTP` class
implements the client side of the FTP protocol. You can use this to write
Python programs that perform a variety of automated FTP jobs, such as
mirroring other FTP servers. It is also used by the module `urllib.request` to
handle URLs that use FTP. For more information on FTP (File Transfer
Protocol), see Internet RFC 959.

The default encoding is UTF-8, following RFC 2640.

Here’s a sample session using the `ftplib` module:

    
    >>> from ftplib import FTP
    >>> ftp = FTP('ftp.us.debian.org')  # connect to host, default port
    >>> ftp.login()                     # user anonymous, passwd anonymous@
    '230 Login successful.'
    >>> ftp.cwd('debian')               # change into "debian" directory
    >>> ftp.retrlines('LIST')           # list directory contents

    >>> with open('README', 'wb') as fp:
    >>>     ftp.retrbinary('RETR README', fp.write)
    '226 Transfer complete.'
    >>> ftp.quit()
    
The module defines the following items:

`class ftplib.FTP(host='', user='', passwd='', acct='', timeout=None,
source_address=None, *, encoding='utf-8')`

    
Return a new instance of the `FTP` class. When host is given, the method call
`connect(host)` is made. When user is given, additionally the method call
`login(user, passwd, acct)` is made (where passwd and acct default to the
empty string when not given). The optional timeout parameter specifies a
timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the connection attempt (if is
not specified, the global default timeout setting will be used).
source_address is a 2-tuple `(host, port)` for the socket to bind to as its
source address before connecting. The encoding parameter specifies the
encoding for directories and filenames.

The `FTP` class supports the `with` statement, e.g.:

    
    >>> from ftplib import FTP
    >>> with FTP("ftp1.at.proftpd.org") as ftp:
    ...     ftp.login()
    ...     ftp.dir()
    ... 
    '230 Anonymous login ok, restrictions apply.'
    dr-xr-xr-x   9 ftp      ftp           154 May  6 10:43 .
    dr-xr-xr-x   9 ftp      ftp           154 May  6 10:43 ..
    dr-xr-xr-x   5 ftp      ftp          4096 May  6 10:43 CentOS
    dr-xr-xr-x   3 ftp      ftp            18 Jul 10  2008 Fedora
    >>>
    
Changed in version 3.2: Support for the `with` statement was added.

Changed in version 3.3: source_address parameter was added.

Changed in version 3.9: If the timeout parameter is set to be zero, it will
raise a `ValueError` to prevent the creation of a non-blocking socket. The
encoding parameter was added, and the default was changed from Latin-1 to
UTF-8 to follow RFC 2640.

`class ftplib.FTP_TLS(host='', user='', passwd='', acct='', keyfile=None,
certfile=None, context=None, timeout=None, source_address=None, *,
encoding='utf-8')`

    
A `FTP` subclass which adds TLS support to FTP as described in RFC 4217.
Connect as usual to port 21 implicitly securing the FTP control connection
before authenticating. Securing the data connection requires the user to
explicitly ask for it by calling the `prot_p()` method. context is a
`ssl.SSLContext` object which allows bundling SSL configuration options,
certificates and private keys into a single (potentially long-lived)
structure. Please read Security considerations for best practices.

keyfile and certfile are a legacy alternative to context – they can point to
PEM-formatted private key and certificate chain files (respectively) for the
SSL connection.

New in version 3.2.

Changed in version 3.3: source_address parameter was added.

Changed in version 3.4: The class now supports hostname check with
`ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname` and Server Name Indication (see
`ssl.HAS_SNI`).

Deprecated since version 3.6: keyfile and certfile are deprecated in favor of
context. Please use `ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain()` instead, or let
`ssl.create_default_context()` select the system’s trusted CA certificates for
you.

Changed in version 3.9: If the timeout parameter is set to be zero, it will
raise a `ValueError` to prevent the creation of a non-blocking socket. The
encoding parameter was added, and the default was changed from Latin-1 to
UTF-8 to follow RFC 2640.

Here’s a sample session using the `FTP_TLS` class:

    
    >>> ftps = FTP_TLS('ftp.pureftpd.org')
    >>> ftps.login()
    '230 Anonymous user logged in'
    >>> ftps.prot_p()
    '200 Data protection level set to "private"'
    >>> ftps.nlst()

`exception ftplib.error_reply`

    
Exception raised when an unexpected reply is received from the server.

`exception ftplib.error_temp`

    
Exception raised when an error code signifying a temporary error (response
codes in the range 400–499) is received.

`exception ftplib.error_perm`

    
Exception raised when an error code signifying a permanent error (response
codes in the range 500–599) is received.

`exception ftplib.error_proto`

    
Exception raised when a reply is received from the server that does not fit
the response specifications of the File Transfer Protocol, i.e. begin with a
digit in the range 1–5.

`ftplib.all_errors`

    
The set of all exceptions (as a tuple) that methods of `FTP` instances may
raise as a result of problems with the FTP connection (as opposed to
programming errors made by the caller). This set includes the four exceptions
listed above as well as `OSError` and `EOFError`.

See also

`Module` `netrc`

    
Parser for the `.netrc` file format. The file `.netrc` is typically used by
FTP clients to load user authentication information before prompting the user.

## FTP Objects

Several methods are available in two flavors: one for handling text files and
another for binary files. These are named for the command which is used
followed by `lines` for the text version or `binary` for the binary version.

`FTP` instances have the following methods:

`FTP.set_debuglevel(level)`

    
Set the instance’s debugging level. This controls the amount of debugging
output printed. The default, `0`, produces no debugging output. A value of `1`
produces a moderate amount of debugging output, generally a single line per
request. A value of `2` or higher produces the maximum amount of debugging
output, logging each line sent and received on the control connection.

`FTP.connect(host='', port=0, timeout=None, source_address=None)`

    
Connect to the given host and port. The default port number is `21`, as
specified by the FTP protocol specification. It is rarely needed to specify a
different port number. This function should be called only once for each
instance; it should not be called at all if a host was given when the instance
was created. All other methods can only be used after a connection has been
made. The optional timeout parameter specifies a timeout in seconds for the
connection attempt. If no timeout is passed, the global default timeout
setting will be used. source_address is a 2-tuple `(host, port)` for the
socket to bind to as its source address before connecting.

Raises an auditing event `ftplib.connect` with arguments `self`, `host`,
`port`.

Changed in version 3.3: source_address parameter was added.

`FTP.getwelcome()`

    
Return the welcome message sent by the server in reply to the initial
connection. (This message sometimes contains disclaimers or help information
that may be relevant to the user.)

`FTP.login(user='anonymous', passwd='', acct='')`

    
Log in as the given user. The passwd and acct parameters are optional and
default to the empty string. If no user is specified, it defaults to
`'anonymous'`. If user is `'anonymous'`, the default passwd is `'anonymous@'`.
This function should be called only once for each instance, after a connection
has been established; it should not be called at all if a host and user were
given when the instance was created. Most FTP commands are only allowed after
the client has logged in. The acct parameter supplies “accounting
information”; few systems implement this.

`FTP.abort()`

    
Abort a file transfer that is in progress. Using this does not always work,
but it’s worth a try.

`FTP.sendcmd(cmd)`

    
Send a simple command string to the server and return the response string.

Raises an auditing event `ftplib.sendcmd` with arguments `self`, `cmd`.

`FTP.voidcmd(cmd)`

    
Send a simple command string to the server and handle the response. Return
nothing if a response code corresponding to success (codes in the range
200–299) is received. Raise `error_reply` otherwise.

Raises an auditing event `ftplib.sendcmd` with arguments `self`, `cmd`.

`FTP.retrbinary(cmd, callback, blocksize=8192, rest=None)`

    
Retrieve a file in binary transfer mode. cmd should be an appropriate `RETR`
command: `'RETR filename'`. The callback function is called for each block of
data received, with a single bytes argument giving the data block. The
optional blocksize argument specifies the maximum chunk size to read on the
low-level socket object created to do the actual transfer (which will also be
the largest size of the data blocks passed to callback). A reasonable default
is chosen. rest means the same thing as in the `transfercmd()` method.

`FTP.retrlines(cmd, callback=None)`

    
Retrieve a file or directory listing in the encoding specified by the encoding
parameter at initialization. cmd should be an appropriate `RETR` command (see
`retrbinary()`) or a command such as `LIST` or `NLST` (usually just the string
`'LIST'`). `LIST` retrieves a list of files and information about those files.
`NLST` retrieves a list of file names. The callback function is called for
each line with a string argument containing the line with the trailing CRLF
stripped. The default callback prints the line to `sys.stdout`.

`FTP.set_pasv(val)`

    
Enable “passive” mode if val is true, otherwise disable passive mode. Passive
mode is on by default.

`FTP.storbinary(cmd, fp, blocksize=8192, callback=None, rest=None)`

    
Store a file in binary transfer mode. cmd should be an appropriate `STOR`
command: `"STOR filename"`. fp is a file object (opened in binary mode) which
is read until EOF using its `read()` method in blocks of size blocksize to
provide the data to be stored. The blocksize argument defaults to 8192.
callback is an optional single parameter callable that is called on each block
of data after it is sent. rest means the same thing as in the `transfercmd()`
method.

Changed in version 3.2: rest parameter added.

`FTP.storlines(cmd, fp, callback=None)`

    
Store a file in line mode. cmd should be an appropriate `STOR` command (see
`storbinary()`). Lines are read until EOF from the file object fp (opened in
binary mode) using its `readline()` method to provide the data to be stored.
callback is an optional single parameter callable that is called on each line
after it is sent.

`FTP.transfercmd(cmd, rest=None)`

    
Initiate a transfer over the data connection. If the transfer is active, send
an `EPRT` or `PORT` command and the transfer command specified by cmd, and
accept the connection. If the server is passive, send an `EPSV` or `PASV`
command, connect to it, and start the transfer command. Either way, return the
socket for the connection.

If optional rest is given, a `REST` command is sent to the server, passing
rest as an argument. rest is usually a byte offset into the requested file,
telling the server to restart sending the file’s bytes at the requested
offset, skipping over the initial bytes. Note however that the `transfercmd()`
method converts rest to a string with the encoding parameter specified at
initialization, but no check is performed on the string’s contents. If the
server does not recognize the `REST` command, an `error_reply` exception will
be raised. If this happens, simply call `transfercmd()` without a rest
argument.

`FTP.ntransfercmd(cmd, rest=None)`

    
Like `transfercmd()`, but returns a tuple of the data connection and the
expected size of the data. If the expected size could not be computed, `None`
will be returned as the expected size. cmd and rest means the same thing as in
`transfercmd()`.

`FTP.mlsd(path="", facts=[])`

    
List a directory in a standardized format by using `MLSD` command (RFC 3659).
If path is omitted the current directory is assumed. facts is a list of
strings representing the type of information desired (e.g. `["type", "size",
"perm"]`). Return a generator object yielding a tuple of two elements for
every file found in path. First element is the file name, the second one is a
dictionary containing facts about the file name. Content of this dictionary
might be limited by the facts argument but server is not guaranteed to return
all requested facts.

New in version 3.3.

`FTP.nlst(argument[, ...])`

    
Return a list of file names as returned by the `NLST` command. The optional
argument is a directory to list (default is the current server directory).
Multiple arguments can be used to pass non-standard options to the `NLST`
command.

Note

If your server supports the command, `mlsd()` offers a better API.

`FTP.dir(argument[, ...])`

    
Produce a directory listing as returned by the `LIST` command, printing it to
standard output. The optional argument is a directory to list (default is the
current server directory). Multiple arguments can be used to pass non-standard
options to the `LIST` command. If the last argument is a function, it is used
as a callback function as for `retrlines()`; the default prints to
`sys.stdout`. This method returns `None`.

Note

If your server supports the command, `mlsd()` offers a better API.

`FTP.rename(fromname, toname)`

    
Rename file fromname on the server to toname.

`FTP.delete(filename)`

    
Remove the file named filename from the server. If successful, returns the
text of the response, otherwise raises `error_perm` on permission errors or
`error_reply` on other errors.

`FTP.cwd(pathname)`

    
Set the current directory on the server.

`FTP.mkd(pathname)`

    
Create a new directory on the server.

`FTP.pwd()`

    
Return the pathname of the current directory on the server.

`FTP.rmd(dirname)`

    
Remove the directory named dirname on the server.

`FTP.size(filename)`

    
Request the size of the file named filename on the server. On success, the
size of the file is returned as an integer, otherwise `None` is returned. Note
that the `SIZE` command is not standardized, but is supported by many common
server implementations.

`FTP.quit()`

    
Send a `QUIT` command to the server and close the connection. This is the
“polite” way to close a connection, but it may raise an exception if the
server responds with an error to the `QUIT` command. This implies a call to
the `close()` method which renders the `FTP` instance useless for subsequent
calls (see below).

`FTP.close()`

    
Close the connection unilaterally. This should not be applied to an already
closed connection such as after a successful call to `quit()`. After this call
the `FTP` instance should not be used any more (after a call to `close()` or
`quit()` you cannot reopen the connection by issuing another `login()`
method).

## FTP_TLS Objects

`FTP_TLS` class inherits from `FTP`, defining these additional objects:

`FTP_TLS.ssl_version`

    
The SSL version to use (defaults to `ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23`).

`FTP_TLS.auth()`

    
Set up a secure control connection by using TLS or SSL, depending on what is
specified in the `ssl_version` attribute.

Changed in version 3.4: The method now supports hostname check with
`ssl.SSLContext.check_hostname` and Server Name Indication (see
`ssl.HAS_SNI`).

`FTP_TLS.ccc()`

    
Revert control channel back to plaintext. This can be useful to take advantage
of firewalls that know how to handle NAT with non-secure FTP without opening
fixed ports.

New in version 3.3.

`FTP_TLS.prot_p()`

    
Set up secure data connection.

`FTP_TLS.prot_c()`

    
Set up clear text data connection.
