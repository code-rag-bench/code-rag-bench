# base64 — Base16, Base32, Base64, Base85 Data Encodings

Source code: Lib/base64.py

This module provides functions for encoding binary data to printable ASCII
characters and decoding such encodings back to binary data. It provides
encoding and decoding functions for the encodings specified in RFC 3548, which
defines the Base16, Base32, and Base64 algorithms, and for the de-facto
standard Ascii85 and Base85 encodings.

The RFC 3548 encodings are suitable for encoding binary data so that it can
safely sent by email, used as parts of URLs, or included as part of an HTTP
POST request. The encoding algorithm is not the same as the uuencode program.

There are two interfaces provided by this module. The modern interface
supports encoding bytes-like objects to ASCII `bytes`, and decoding bytes-like
objects or strings containing ASCII to `bytes`. Both base-64 alphabets defined
in RFC 3548 (normal, and URL- and filesystem-safe) are supported.

The legacy interface does not support decoding from strings, but it does
provide functions for encoding and decoding to and from file objects. It only
supports the Base64 standard alphabet, and it adds newlines every 76
characters as per RFC 2045. Note that if you are looking for RFC 2045 support
you probably want to be looking at the `email` package instead.

Changed in version 3.3: ASCII-only Unicode strings are now accepted by the
decoding functions of the modern interface.

Changed in version 3.4: Any bytes-like objects are now accepted by all
encoding and decoding functions in this module. Ascii85/Base85 support added.

The modern interface provides:

`base64.b64encode(s, altchars=None)`

    
Encode the bytes-like object s using Base64 and return the encoded `bytes`.

Optional altchars must be a bytes-like object of at least length 2 (additional
characters are ignored) which specifies an alternative alphabet for the `+`
and `/` characters. This allows an application to e.g. generate URL or
filesystem safe Base64 strings. The default is `None`, for which the standard
Base64 alphabet is used.

`base64.b64decode(s, altchars=None, validate=False)`

    
Decode the Base64 encoded bytes-like object or ASCII string s and return the
decoded `bytes`.

Optional altchars must be a bytes-like object or ASCII string of at least
length 2 (additional characters are ignored) which specifies the alternative
alphabet used instead of the `+` and `/` characters.

A `binascii.Error` exception is raised if s is incorrectly padded.

If validate is `False` (the default), characters that are neither in the
normal base-64 alphabet nor the alternative alphabet are discarded prior to
the padding check. If validate is `True`, these non-alphabet characters in the
input result in a `binascii.Error`.

`base64.standard_b64encode(s)`

    
Encode bytes-like object s using the standard Base64 alphabet and return the
encoded `bytes`.

`base64.standard_b64decode(s)`

    
Decode bytes-like object or ASCII string s using the standard Base64 alphabet
and return the decoded `bytes`.

`base64.urlsafe_b64encode(s)`

    
Encode bytes-like object s using the URL- and filesystem-safe alphabet, which
substitutes `-` instead of `+` and `_` instead of `/` in the standard Base64
alphabet, and return the encoded `bytes`. The result can still contain `=`.

`base64.urlsafe_b64decode(s)`

    
Decode bytes-like object or ASCII string s using the URL- and filesystem-safe
alphabet, which substitutes `-` instead of `+` and `_` instead of `/` in the
standard Base64 alphabet, and return the decoded `bytes`.

`base64.b32encode(s)`

    
Encode the bytes-like object s using Base32 and return the encoded `bytes`.

`base64.b32decode(s, casefold=False, map01=None)`

    
Decode the Base32 encoded bytes-like object or ASCII string s and return the
decoded `bytes`.

Optional casefold is a flag specifying whether a lowercase alphabet is
acceptable as input. For security purposes, the default is `False`.

RFC 3548 allows for optional mapping of the digit 0 (zero) to the letter O
(oh), and for optional mapping of the digit 1 (one) to either the letter I
(eye) or letter L (el). The optional argument map01 when not `None`, specifies
which letter the digit 1 should be mapped to (when map01 is not `None`, the
digit 0 is always mapped to the letter O). For security purposes the default
is `None`, so that 0 and 1 are not allowed in the input.

A `binascii.Error` is raised if s is incorrectly padded or if there are non-
alphabet characters present in the input.

`base64.b16encode(s)`

    
Encode the bytes-like object s using Base16 and return the encoded `bytes`.

`base64.b16decode(s, casefold=False)`

    
Decode the Base16 encoded bytes-like object or ASCII string s and return the
decoded `bytes`.

Optional casefold is a flag specifying whether a lowercase alphabet is
acceptable as input. For security purposes, the default is `False`.

A `binascii.Error` is raised if s is incorrectly padded or if there are non-
alphabet characters present in the input.

`base64.a85encode(b, *, foldspaces=False, wrapcol=0, pad=False, adobe=False)`

    
Encode the bytes-like object b using Ascii85 and return the encoded `bytes`.

foldspaces is an optional flag that uses the special short sequence ‘y’
instead of 4 consecutive spaces (ASCII 0x20) as supported by ‘btoa’. This
feature is not supported by the “standard” Ascii85 encoding.

wrapcol controls whether the output should have newline (`b'\n'`) characters
added to it. If this is non-zero, each output line will be at most this many
characters long.

pad controls whether the input is padded to a multiple of 4 before encoding.
Note that the `btoa` implementation always pads.

adobe controls whether the encoded byte sequence is framed with `<~` and `~>`,
which is used by the Adobe implementation.

New in version 3.4.

`base64.a85decode(b, *, foldspaces=False, adobe=False, ignorechars=b'
\t\n\r\v')`

    
Decode the Ascii85 encoded bytes-like object or ASCII string b and return the
decoded `bytes`.

foldspaces is a flag that specifies whether the ‘y’ short sequence should be
accepted as shorthand for 4 consecutive spaces (ASCII 0x20). This feature is
not supported by the “standard” Ascii85 encoding.

adobe controls whether the input sequence is in Adobe Ascii85 format (i.e. is
framed with <~ and ~>).

ignorechars should be a bytes-like object or ASCII string containing
characters to ignore from the input. This should only contain whitespace
characters, and by default contains all whitespace characters in ASCII.

New in version 3.4.

`base64.b85encode(b, pad=False)`

    
Encode the bytes-like object b using base85 (as used in e.g. git-style binary
diffs) and return the encoded `bytes`.

If pad is true, the input is padded with `b'\0'` so its length is a multiple
of 4 bytes before encoding.

New in version 3.4.

`base64.b85decode(b)`

    
Decode the base85-encoded bytes-like object or ASCII string b and return the
decoded `bytes`. Padding is implicitly removed, if necessary.

New in version 3.4.

The legacy interface:

`base64.decode(input, output)`

    
Decode the contents of the binary input file and write the resulting binary
data to the output file. input and output must be file objects. input will be
read until `input.readline()` returns an empty bytes object.

`base64.decodebytes(s)`

    
Decode the bytes-like object s, which must contain one or more lines of base64
encoded data, and return the decoded `bytes`.

New in version 3.1.

`base64.encode(input, output)`

    
Encode the contents of the binary input file and write the resulting base64
encoded data to the output file. input and output must be file objects. input
will be read until `input.read()` returns an empty bytes object. `encode()`
inserts a newline character (`b'\n'`) after every 76 bytes of the output, as
well as ensuring that the output always ends with a newline, as per RFC 2045
(MIME).

`base64.encodebytes(s)`

    
Encode the bytes-like object s, which can contain arbitrary binary data, and
return `bytes` containing the base64-encoded data, with newlines (`b'\n'`)
inserted after every 76 bytes of output, and ensuring that there is a trailing
newline, as per RFC 2045 (MIME).

New in version 3.1.

An example usage of the module:

    
    >>> import base64
    >>> encoded = base64.b64encode(b'data to be encoded')
    >>> encoded
    b'ZGF0YSB0byBiZSBlbmNvZGVk'
    >>> data = base64.b64decode(encoded)
    >>> data
    b'data to be encoded'
