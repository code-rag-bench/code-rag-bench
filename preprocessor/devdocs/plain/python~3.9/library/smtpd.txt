# smtpd — SMTP Server

Source code: Lib/smtpd.py

This module offers several classes to implement SMTP (email) servers.

See also

The aiosmtpd package is a recommended replacement for this module. It is based
on `asyncio` and provides a more straightforward API. `smtpd` should be
considered deprecated.

Several server implementations are present; one is a generic do-nothing
implementation, which can be overridden, while the other two offer specific
mail-sending strategies.

Additionally the SMTPChannel may be extended to implement very specific
interaction behaviour with SMTP clients.

The code supports RFC 5321, plus the RFC 1870 SIZE and RFC 6531 SMTPUTF8
extensions.

## SMTPServer Objects

`class smtpd.SMTPServer(localaddr, remoteaddr, data_size_limit=33554432,
map=None, enable_SMTPUTF8=False, decode_data=False)`

    
Create a new `SMTPServer` object, which binds to local address localaddr. It
will treat remoteaddr as an upstream SMTP relayer. Both localaddr and
remoteaddr should be a (host, port) tuple. The object inherits from
`asyncore.dispatcher`, and so will insert itself into `asyncore`’s event loop
on instantiation.

data_size_limit specifies the maximum number of bytes that will be accepted in
a `DATA` command. A value of `None` or `0` means no limit.

map is the socket map to use for connections (an initially empty dictionary is
a suitable value). If not specified the `asyncore` global socket map is used.

enable_SMTPUTF8 determines whether the `SMTPUTF8` extension (as defined in RFC
6531) should be enabled. The default is `False`. When `True`, `SMTPUTF8` is
accepted as a parameter to the `MAIL` command and when present is passed to
`process_message()` in the `kwargs['mail_options']` list. decode_data and
enable_SMTPUTF8 cannot be set to `True` at the same time.

decode_data specifies whether the data portion of the SMTP transaction should
be decoded using UTF-8. When decode_data is `False` (the default), the server
advertises the `8BITMIME` extension (RFC 6152), accepts the `BODY=8BITMIME`
parameter to the `MAIL` command, and when present passes it to
`process_message()` in the `kwargs['mail_options']` list. decode_data and
enable_SMTPUTF8 cannot be set to `True` at the same time.

`process_message(peer, mailfrom, rcpttos, data, **kwargs)`

    
Raise a `NotImplementedError` exception. Override this in subclasses to do
something useful with this message. Whatever was passed in the constructor as
remoteaddr will be available as the `_remoteaddr` attribute. peer is the
remote host’s address, mailfrom is the envelope originator, rcpttos are the
envelope recipients and data is a string containing the contents of the e-mail
(which should be in RFC 5321 format).

If the decode_data constructor keyword is set to `True`, the data argument
will be a unicode string. If it is set to `False`, it will be a bytes object.

kwargs is a dictionary containing additional information. It is empty if
`decode_data=True` was given as an init argument, otherwise it contains the
following keys:

mail_options:

    
a list of all received parameters to the `MAIL` command (the elements are
uppercase strings; example: `['BODY=8BITMIME', 'SMTPUTF8']`).

rcpt_options:

    
same as mail_options but for the `RCPT` command. Currently no `RCPT TO`
options are supported, so for now this will always be an empty list.

Implementations of `process_message` should use the `**kwargs` signature to
accept arbitrary keyword arguments, since future feature enhancements may add
keys to the kwargs dictionary.

Return `None` to request a normal `250 Ok` response; otherwise return the
desired response string in RFC 5321 format.

`channel_class`

    
Override this in subclasses to use a custom `SMTPChannel` for managing SMTP
clients.

New in version 3.4: The map constructor argument.

Changed in version 3.5: localaddr and remoteaddr may now contain IPv6
addresses.

New in version 3.5: The decode_data and enable_SMTPUTF8 constructor
parameters, and the kwargs parameter to `process_message()` when decode_data
is `False`.

Changed in version 3.6: decode_data is now `False` by default.

## DebuggingServer Objects

`class smtpd.DebuggingServer(localaddr, remoteaddr)`

    
Create a new debugging server. Arguments are as per `SMTPServer`. Messages
will be discarded, and printed on stdout.

## PureProxy Objects

`class smtpd.PureProxy(localaddr, remoteaddr)`

    
Create a new pure proxy server. Arguments are as per `SMTPServer`. Everything
will be relayed to remoteaddr. Note that running this has a good chance to
make you into an open relay, so please be careful.

## MailmanProxy Objects

`class smtpd.MailmanProxy(localaddr, remoteaddr)`

    
Deprecated since version 3.9, will be removed in version 3.11: `MailmanProxy`
is deprecated, it depends on a `Mailman` module which no longer exists and
therefore is already broken.

Create a new pure proxy server. Arguments are as per `SMTPServer`. Everything
will be relayed to remoteaddr, unless local mailman configurations knows about
an address, in which case it will be handled via mailman. Note that running
this has a good chance to make you into an open relay, so please be careful.

## SMTPChannel Objects

`class smtpd.SMTPChannel(server, conn, addr, data_size_limit=33554432,
map=None, enable_SMTPUTF8=False, decode_data=False)`

    
Create a new `SMTPChannel` object which manages the communication between the
server and a single SMTP client.

conn and addr are as per the instance variables described below.

data_size_limit specifies the maximum number of bytes that will be accepted in
a `DATA` command. A value of `None` or `0` means no limit.

enable_SMTPUTF8 determines whether the `SMTPUTF8` extension (as defined in RFC
6531) should be enabled. The default is `False`. decode_data and
enable_SMTPUTF8 cannot be set to `True` at the same time.

A dictionary can be specified in map to avoid using a global socket map.

decode_data specifies whether the data portion of the SMTP transaction should
be decoded using UTF-8. The default is `False`. decode_data and
enable_SMTPUTF8 cannot be set to `True` at the same time.

To use a custom SMTPChannel implementation you need to override the
`SMTPServer.channel_class` of your `SMTPServer`.

Changed in version 3.5: The decode_data and enable_SMTPUTF8 parameters were
added.

Changed in version 3.6: decode_data is now `False` by default.

The `SMTPChannel` has the following instance variables:

`smtp_server`

    
Holds the `SMTPServer` that spawned this channel.

`conn`

    
Holds the socket object connecting to the client.

`addr`

    
Holds the address of the client, the second value returned by `socket.accept`

`received_lines`

    
Holds a list of the line strings (decoded using UTF-8) received from the
client. The lines have their `"\r\n"` line ending translated to `"\n"`.

`smtp_state`

    
Holds the current state of the channel. This will be either `COMMAND`
initially and then `DATA` after the client sends a “DATA” line.

`seen_greeting`

    
Holds a string containing the greeting sent by the client in its “HELO”.

`mailfrom`

    
Holds a string containing the address identified in the “MAIL FROM:” line from
the client.

`rcpttos`

    
Holds a list of strings containing the addresses identified in the “RCPT TO:”
lines from the client.

`received_data`

    
Holds a string containing all of the data sent by the client during the DATA
state, up to but not including the terminating `"\r\n.\r\n"`.

`fqdn`

    
Holds the fully-qualified domain name of the server as returned by
`socket.getfqdn()`.

`peer`

    
Holds the name of the client peer as returned by `conn.getpeername()` where
`conn` is `conn`.

The `SMTPChannel` operates by invoking methods named `smtp_<command>` upon
reception of a command line from the client. Built into the base `SMTPChannel`
class are methods for handling the following commands (and responding to them
appropriately):

Command | Action taken  
---|---  
HELO | Accepts the greeting from the client and stores it in `seen_greeting`. Sets server to base command mode.  
EHLO | Accepts the greeting from the client and stores it in `seen_greeting`. Sets server to extended command mode.  
NOOP | Takes no action.  
QUIT | Closes the connection cleanly.  
MAIL | Accepts the “MAIL FROM:” syntax and stores the supplied address as `mailfrom`. In extended command mode, accepts the RFC 1870 SIZE attribute and responds appropriately based on the value of data_size_limit.  
RCPT | Accepts the “RCPT TO:” syntax and stores the supplied addresses in the `rcpttos` list.  
RSET | Resets the `mailfrom`, `rcpttos`, and `received_data`, but not the greeting.  
DATA | Sets the internal state to `DATA` and stores remaining lines from the client in `received_data` until the terminator `"\r\n.\r\n"` is received.  
HELP | Returns minimal information on command syntax  
VRFY | Returns code 252 (the server doesn’t know if the address is valid)  
EXPN | Reports that the command is not implemented.
