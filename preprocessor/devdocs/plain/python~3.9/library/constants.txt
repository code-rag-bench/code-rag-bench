# Built-in Constants

A small number of constants live in the built-in namespace. They are:

`False`

    
The false value of the `bool` type. Assignments to `False` are illegal and
raise a `SyntaxError`.

`True`

    
The true value of the `bool` type. Assignments to `True` are illegal and raise
a `SyntaxError`.

`None`

    
The sole value of the type `NoneType`. `None` is frequently used to represent
the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not passed to a
function. Assignments to `None` are illegal and raise a `SyntaxError`.

`NotImplemented`

    
Special value which should be returned by the binary special methods (e.g.
`__eq__()`, `__lt__()`, `__add__()`, `__rsub__()`, etc.) to indicate that the
operation is not implemented with respect to the other type; may be returned
by the in-place binary special methods (e.g. `__imul__()`, `__iand__()`, etc.)
for the same purpose. It should not be evaluated in a boolean context.

Note

When a binary (or in-place) method returns `NotImplemented` the interpreter
will try the reflected operation on the other type (or some other fallback,
depending on the operator). If all attempts return `NotImplemented`, the
interpreter will raise an appropriate exception. Incorrectly returning
`NotImplemented` will result in a misleading error message or the
`NotImplemented` value being returned to Python code.

See Implementing the arithmetic operations for examples.

Note

`NotImplementedError` and `NotImplemented` are not interchangeable, even
though they have similar names and purposes. See `NotImplementedError` for
details on when to use it.

Changed in version 3.9: Evaluating `NotImplemented` in a boolean context is
deprecated. While it currently evaluates as true, it will emit a
`DeprecationWarning`. It will raise a `TypeError` in a future version of
Python.

`Ellipsis`

    
The same as the ellipsis literal “`...`”. Special value used mostly in
conjunction with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data
types.

`__debug__`

    
This constant is true if Python was not started with an `-O` option. See also
the `assert` statement.

Note

The names `None`, `False`, `True` and `__debug__` cannot be reassigned
(assignments to them, even as an attribute name, raise `SyntaxError`), so they
can be considered “true” constants.

## Constants added by the site module

The `site` module (which is imported automatically during startup, except if
the `-S` command-line option is given) adds several constants to the built-in
namespace. They are useful for the interactive interpreter shell and should
not be used in programs.

`quit(code=None)`

`exit(code=None)`

    
Objects that when printed, print a message like “Use quit() or Ctrl-D (i.e.
EOF) to exit”, and when called, raise `SystemExit` with the specified exit
code.

`copyright`

`credits`

    
Objects that when printed or called, print the text of copyright or credits,
respectively.

`license`

    
Object that when printed, prints the message “Type license() to see the full
license text”, and when called, displays the full license text in a pager-like
fashion (one screen at a time).
