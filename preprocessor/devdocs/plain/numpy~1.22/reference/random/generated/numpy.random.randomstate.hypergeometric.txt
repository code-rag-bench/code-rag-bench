# numpy.random.RandomState.hypergeometric

method

random.RandomState.hypergeometric(ngood, nbad, nsample, size=None)

    
Draw samples from a Hypergeometric distribution.

Samples are drawn from a hypergeometric distribution with specified
parameters, `ngood` (ways to make a good selection), `nbad` (ways to make a
bad selection), and `nsample` (number of items sampled, which is less than or
equal to the sum `ngood + nbad`).

Note

New code should use the `hypergeometric` method of a `default_rng()` instance
instead; please see the Quick Start.

Parameters

    
ngoodint or array_like of ints

    
Number of ways to make a good selection. Must be nonnegative.

nbadint or array_like of ints

    
Number of ways to make a bad selection. Must be nonnegative.

nsampleint or array_like of ints

    
Number of items sampled. Must be at least 1 and at most `ngood + nbad`.

sizeint or tuple of ints, optional

    
Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., `(m, n, k)`, then `m * n * k`
samples are drawn. If size is `None` (default), a single value is returned if
`ngood`, `nbad`, and `nsample` are all scalars. Otherwise,
`np.broadcast(ngood, nbad, nsample).size` samples are drawn.

Returns

    
outndarray or scalar

    
Drawn samples from the parameterized hypergeometric distribution. Each sample
is the number of good items within a randomly selected subset of size
`nsample` taken from a set of `ngood` good items and `nbad` bad items.

#### Notes

The probability density for the Hypergeometric distribution is

\\[P(x) = \frac{\binom{g}{x}\binom{b}{n-x}}{\binom{g+b}{n}},\\]

where \\(0 \le x \le n\\) and \\(n-b \le x \le g\\)

for P(x) the probability of `x` good results in the drawn sample, g = `ngood`,
b = `nbad`, and n = `nsample`.

Consider an urn with black and white marbles in it, `ngood` of them are black
and `nbad` are white. If you draw `nsample` balls without replacement, then
the hypergeometric distribution describes the distribution of black balls in
the drawn sample.

Note that this distribution is very similar to the binomial distribution,
except that in this case, samples are drawn without replacement, whereas in
the Binomial case samples are drawn with replacement (or the sample space is
infinite). As the sample space becomes large, this distribution approaches the
binomial.

#### Examples

Draw samples from the distribution:

    
    >>> ngood, nbad, nsamp = 100, 2, 10
    # number of good, number of bad, and number of samples
    >>> s = np.random.hypergeometric(ngood, nbad, nsamp, 1000)
    >>> from matplotlib.pyplot import hist
    >>> hist(s)
    #   note that it is very unlikely to grab both bad items
    
Suppose you have an urn with 15 white and 15 black marbles. If you pull 15
marbles at random, how likely is it that 12 or more of them are one color?

    
    >>> s = np.random.hypergeometric(15, 15, 15, 100000)
    >>> sum(s>=12)/100000. + sum(s<=3)/100000.
    #   answer = 0.003 ... pretty unlikely!
