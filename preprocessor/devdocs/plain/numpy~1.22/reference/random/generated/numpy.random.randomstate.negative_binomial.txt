# numpy.random.RandomState.negative_binomial

method

random.RandomState.negative_binomial(n, p, size=None)

    
Draw samples from a negative binomial distribution.

Samples are drawn from a negative binomial distribution with specified
parameters, `n` successes and `p` probability of success where `n` is > 0 and
`p` is in the interval [0, 1].

Note

New code should use the `negative_binomial` method of a `default_rng()`
instance instead; please see the Quick Start.

Parameters

    
nfloat or array_like of floats

    
Parameter of the distribution, > 0.

pfloat or array_like of floats

    
Parameter of the distribution, >= 0 and <=1.

sizeint or tuple of ints, optional

    
Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., `(m, n, k)`, then `m * n * k`
samples are drawn. If size is `None` (default), a single value is returned if
`n` and `p` are both scalars. Otherwise, `np.broadcast(n, p).size` samples are
drawn.

Returns

    
outndarray or scalar

    
Drawn samples from the parameterized negative binomial distribution, where
each sample is equal to N, the number of failures that occurred before a total
of n successes was reached.

#### Notes

The probability mass function of the negative binomial distribution is

\\[P(N;n,p) = \frac{\Gamma(N+n)}{N!\Gamma(n)}p^{n}(1-p)^{N},\\]

where \\(n\\) is the number of successes, \\(p\\) is the probability of
success, \\(N+n\\) is the number of trials, and \\(\Gamma\\) is the gamma
function. When \\(n\\) is an integer, \\(\frac{\Gamma(N+n)}{N!\Gamma(n)} =
\binom{N+n-1}{N}\\), which is the more common form of this term in the the
pmf. The negative binomial distribution gives the probability of N failures
given n successes, with a success on the last trial.

If one throws a die repeatedly until the third time a “1” appears, then the
probability distribution of the number of non-“1”s that appear before the
third “1” is a negative binomial distribution.

#### Examples

Draw samples from the distribution:

A real world example. A company drills wild-cat oil exploration wells, each
with an estimated probability of success of 0.1. What is the probability of
having one success for each successive well, that is what is the probability
of a single success after drilling 5 wells, after 6 wells, etc.?

    
    >>> s = np.random.negative_binomial(1, 0.1, 100000)
    >>> for i in range(1, 11): 
    ...    probability = sum(s<i) / 100000.
    ...    print(i, "wells drilled, probability of one success =", probability)
