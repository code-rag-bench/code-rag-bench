# numpy.random.RandomState.choice

method

random.RandomState.choice(a, size=None, replace=True, p=None)

    
Generates a random sample from a given 1-D array

New in version 1.7.0.

Note

New code should use the `choice` method of a `default_rng()` instance instead;
please see the Quick Start.

Parameters

    
a1-D array-like or int

    
If an ndarray, a random sample is generated from its elements. If an int, the
random sample is generated as if it were `np.arange(a)`

sizeint or tuple of ints, optional

    
Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., `(m, n, k)`, then `m * n * k`
samples are drawn. Default is None, in which case a single value is returned.

replaceboolean, optional

    
Whether the sample is with or without replacement. Default is True, meaning
that a value of `a` can be selected multiple times.

p1-D array-like, optional

    
The probabilities associated with each entry in a. If not given, the sample
assumes a uniform distribution over all entries in `a`.

Returns

    
samplessingle item or ndarray

    
The generated random samples

Raises

    
ValueError

    
If a is an int and less than zero, if a or p are not 1-dimensional, if a is an
array-like of size 0, if p is not a vector of probabilities, if a and p have
different lengths, or if replace=False and the sample size is greater than the
population size

#### Notes

Setting user-specified probabilities through `p` uses a more general but less
efficient sampler than the default. The general sampler produces a different
sample than the optimized sampler even if each element of `p` is 1 / len(a).

Sampling random rows from a 2-D array is not possible with this function, but
is possible with `Generator.choice` through its `axis` keyword.

#### Examples

Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:

    
    >>> np.random.choice(5, 3)
    array([0, 3, 4]) # random
    >>> #This is equivalent to np.random.randint(0,5,3)
    
Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3:

    
    >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
    array([3, 3, 0]) # random
    
Generate a uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3 without
replacement:

    
    >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, replace=False)
    array([3,1,0]) # random
    >>> #This is equivalent to np.random.permutation(np.arange(5))[:3]
    
Generate a non-uniform random sample from np.arange(5) of size 3 without
replacement:

    
    >>> np.random.choice(5, 3, replace=False, p=[0.1, 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0])
    array([2, 3, 0]) # random
    
Any of the above can be repeated with an arbitrary array-like instead of just
integers. For instance:

    
    >>> aa_milne_arr = ['pooh', 'rabbit', 'piglet', 'Christopher']
    >>> np.random.choice(aa_milne_arr, 5, p=[0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3])
    array(['pooh', 'pooh', 'pooh', 'Christopher', 'piglet'], # random
          dtype='<U11')
