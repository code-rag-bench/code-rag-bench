# numpy.arcsinh

numpy.arcsinh(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'arcsinh'>

    
Inverse hyperbolic sine element-wise.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Input array.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
outndarray or scalar

    
Array of the same shape as `x`. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

#### Notes

`arcsinh` is a multivalued function: for each `x` there are infinitely many
numbers `z` such that `sinh(z) = x`. The convention is to return the `z` whose
imaginary part lies in `[-pi/2, pi/2]`.

For real-valued input data types, `arcsinh` always returns real output. For
each value that cannot be expressed as a real number or infinity, it returns
`nan` and sets the `invalid` floating point error flag.

For complex-valued input, `arccos` is a complex analytical function that has
branch cuts `[1j, infj]` and `[-1j, -infj]` and is continuous from the right
on the former and from the left on the latter.

The inverse hyperbolic sine is also known as `asinh` or `sinh^-1`.
