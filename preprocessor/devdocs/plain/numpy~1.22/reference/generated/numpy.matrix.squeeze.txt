# numpy.matrix.squeeze

method

matrix.squeeze(axis=None)[source]

    
Return a possibly reshaped matrix.

Refer to `numpy.squeeze` for more documentation.

Parameters

    
axisNone or int or tuple of ints, optional

    
Selects a subset of the axes of length one in the shape. If an axis is
selected with shape entry greater than one, an error is raised.

Returns

    
squeezedmatrix

    
The matrix, but as a (1, N) matrix if it had shape (N, 1).

#### Notes

If `m` has a single column then that column is returned as the single row of a
matrix. Otherwise `m` is returned. The returned matrix is always either `m`
itself or a view into `m`. Supplying an axis keyword argument will not affect
the returned matrix but it may cause an error to be raised.

#### Examples

    
    >>> c = np.matrix([[1], [2]])
    >>> c
    matrix([[1],
            [2]])
    >>> c.squeeze()
    matrix([[1, 2]])
    >>> r = c.T
    >>> r
    matrix([[1, 2]])
    >>> r.squeeze()
    matrix([[1, 2]])
    >>> m = np.matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> m.squeeze()
    matrix([[1, 2],
            [3, 4]])
