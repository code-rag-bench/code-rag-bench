# numpy.ma.MaskedArray.astype

method

ma.MaskedArray.astype(dtype, order='K', casting='unsafe', subok=True,
copy=True)

    
Copy of the array, cast to a specified type.

Parameters

    
dtypestr or dtype

    
Typecode or data-type to which the array is cast.

order{‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’, ‘K’}, optional

    
Controls the memory layout order of the result. ‘C’ means C order, ‘F’ means
Fortran order, ‘A’ means ‘F’ order if all the arrays are Fortran contiguous,
‘C’ order otherwise, and ‘K’ means as close to the order the array elements
appear in memory as possible. Default is ‘K’.

casting{‘no’, ‘equiv’, ‘safe’, ‘same_kind’, ‘unsafe’}, optional

    
Controls what kind of data casting may occur. Defaults to ‘unsafe’ for
backwards compatibility.

  * ‘no’ means the data types should not be cast at all.
  * ‘equiv’ means only byte-order changes are allowed.
  * ‘safe’ means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
  * ‘same_kind’ means only safe casts or casts within a kind, like float64 to float32, are allowed.
  * ‘unsafe’ means any data conversions may be done.

subokbool, optional

    
If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through (default), otherwise the
returned array will be forced to be a base-class array.

copybool, optional

    
By default, astype always returns a newly allocated array. If this is set to
false, and the `dtype`, `order`, and `subok` requirements are satisfied, the
input array is returned instead of a copy.

Returns

    
arr_tndarray

    
Unless `copy` is False and the other conditions for returning the input array
are satisfied (see description for `copy` input parameter), `arr_t` is a new
array of the same shape as the input array, with dtype, order given by
`dtype`, `order`.

Raises

    
ComplexWarning

    
When casting from complex to float or int. To avoid this, one should use
`a.real.astype(t)`.

#### Notes

Changed in version 1.17.0: Casting between a simple data type and a structured
one is possible only for “unsafe” casting. Casting to multiple fields is
allowed, but casting from multiple fields is not.

Changed in version 1.9.0: Casting from numeric to string types in ‘safe’
casting mode requires that the string dtype length is long enough to store the
max integer/float value converted.

#### Examples

    
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 2.5])
    >>> x
    array([1. ,  2. ,  2.5])
    
    
    >>> x.astype(int)
    array([1, 2, 2])
