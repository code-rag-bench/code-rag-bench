# numpy.linalg.pinv

linalg.pinv(a, rcond=1e-15, hermitian=False)[source]

    
Compute the (Moore-Penrose) pseudo-inverse of a matrix.

Calculate the generalized inverse of a matrix using its singular-value
decomposition (SVD) and including all large singular values.

Changed in version 1.14: Can now operate on stacks of matrices

Parameters

    
a(…, M, N) array_like

    
Matrix or stack of matrices to be pseudo-inverted.

rcond(…) array_like of float

    
Cutoff for small singular values. Singular values less than or equal to `rcond
* largest_singular_value` are set to zero. Broadcasts against the stack of
matrices.

hermitianbool, optional

    
If True, `a` is assumed to be Hermitian (symmetric if real-valued), enabling a
more efficient method for finding singular values. Defaults to False.

New in version 1.17.0.

Returns

    
B(…, N, M) ndarray

    
The pseudo-inverse of `a`. If `a` is a `matrix` instance, then so is `B`.

Raises

    
LinAlgError

    
If the SVD computation does not converge.

#### Notes

The pseudo-inverse of a matrix A, denoted \\(A^+\\), is defined as: “the
matrix that ‘solves’ [the least-squares problem] \\(Ax = b\\),” i.e., if
\\(\bar{x}\\) is said solution, then \\(A^+\\) is that matrix such that
\\(\bar{x} = A^+b\\).

It can be shown that if \\(Q_1 \Sigma Q_2^T = A\\) is the singular value
decomposition of A, then \\(A^+ = Q_2 \Sigma^+ Q_1^T\\), where \\(Q_{1,2}\\)
are orthogonal matrices, \\(\Sigma\\) is a diagonal matrix consisting of A’s
so-called singular values, (followed, typically, by zeros), and then
\\(\Sigma^+\\) is simply the diagonal matrix consisting of the reciprocals of
A’s singular values (again, followed by zeros). [1]

#### Examples

The following example checks that `a * a+ * a == a` and `a+ * a * a+ == a+`:

    
    >>> a = np.random.randn(9, 6)
    >>> B = np.linalg.pinv(a)
    >>> np.allclose(a, np.dot(a, np.dot(B, a)))
    True
    >>> np.allclose(B, np.dot(B, np.dot(a, B)))
    True
