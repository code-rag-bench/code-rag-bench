# numpy.linalg.eig

linalg.eig(a)[source]

    
Compute the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a square array.

Parameters

    
a(…, M, M) array

    
Matrices for which the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors will be computed

Returns

    
w(…, M) array

    
The eigenvalues, each repeated according to its multiplicity. The eigenvalues
are not necessarily ordered. The resulting array will be of complex type,
unless the imaginary part is zero in which case it will be cast to a real
type. When `a` is real the resulting eigenvalues will be real (0 imaginary
part) or occur in conjugate pairs

v(…, M, M) array

    
The normalized (unit “length”) eigenvectors, such that the column `v[:,i]` is
the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `w[i]`.

Raises

    
LinAlgError

    
If the eigenvalue computation does not converge.

`eigvals`

    
eigenvalues of a non-symmetric array.

`eigh`

    
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real symmetric or complex Hermitian
(conjugate symmetric) array.

`eigvalsh`

    
eigenvalues of a real symmetric or complex Hermitian (conjugate symmetric)
array.

`scipy.linalg.eig`

    
Similar function in SciPy that also solves the generalized eigenvalue problem.

`scipy.linalg.schur`

    
Best choice for unitary and other non-Hermitian normal matrices.

#### Notes

New in version 1.8.0.

Broadcasting rules apply, see the `numpy.linalg` documentation for details.

This is implemented using the `_geev` LAPACK routines which compute the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general square arrays.

The number `w` is an eigenvalue of `a` if there exists a vector `v` such that
`a @ v = w * v`. Thus, the arrays `a`, `w`, and `v` satisfy the equations `a @
v[:,i] = w[i] * v[:,i]` for \\(i \in \\{0,...,M-1\\}\\).

The array `v` of eigenvectors may not be of maximum rank, that is, some of the
columns may be linearly dependent, although round-off error may obscure that
fact. If the eigenvalues are all different, then theoretically the
eigenvectors are linearly independent and `a` can be diagonalized by a
similarity transformation using `v`, i.e, `inv(v) @ a @ v` is diagonal.

For non-Hermitian normal matrices the SciPy function `scipy.linalg.schur` is
preferred because the matrix `v` is guaranteed to be unitary, which is not the
case when using `eig`. The Schur factorization produces an upper triangular
matrix rather than a diagonal matrix, but for normal matrices only the
diagonal of the upper triangular matrix is needed, the rest is roundoff error.

Finally, it is emphasized that `v` consists of the right (as in right-hand
side) eigenvectors of `a`. A vector `y` satisfying `y.T @ a = z * y.T` for
some number `z` is called a left eigenvector of `a`, and, in general, the left
and right eigenvectors of a matrix are not necessarily the (perhaps conjugate)
transposes of each other.

#### Examples

    
    >>> from numpy import linalg as LA
    
(Almost) trivial example with real e-values and e-vectors.

    
    >>> w, v = LA.eig(np.diag((1, 2, 3)))
    >>> w; v
    array([1., 2., 3.])
    array([[1., 0., 0.],
           [0., 1., 0.],
           [0., 0., 1.]])
    
Real matrix possessing complex e-values and e-vectors; note that the e-values
are complex conjugates of each other.

    
    >>> w, v = LA.eig(np.array([[1, -1], [1, 1]]))
    >>> w; v
    array([1.+1.j, 1.-1.j])
    array([[0.70710678+0.j        , 0.70710678-0.j        ],
           [0.        -0.70710678j, 0.        +0.70710678j]])
    
Complex-valued matrix with real e-values (but complex-valued e-vectors); note
that `a.conj().T == a`, i.e., `a` is Hermitian.

    
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 1j], [-1j, 1]])
    >>> w, v = LA.eig(a)
    >>> w; v
    array([2.+0.j, 0.+0.j])
    array([[ 0.        +0.70710678j,  0.70710678+0.j        ], # may vary
           [ 0.70710678+0.j        , -0.        +0.70710678j]])
    
Be careful about round-off error!

    
    >>> a = np.array([[1 + 1e-9, 0], [0, 1 - 1e-9]])
    >>> # Theor. e-values are 1 +/- 1e-9
    >>> w, v = LA.eig(a)
    >>> w; v
    array([1., 1.])
    array([[1., 0.],
           [0., 1.]])
