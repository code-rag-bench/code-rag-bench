# numpy.fix

numpy.fix(x, out=None)[source]

    
Round to nearest integer towards zero.

Round an array of floats element-wise to nearest integer towards zero. The
rounded values are returned as floats.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
An array of floats to be rounded

outndarray, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the input broadcasts to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned.

Returns

    
outndarray of floats

    
A float array with the same dimensions as the input. If second argument is not
supplied then a float array is returned with the rounded values.

If a second argument is supplied the result is stored there. The return value
`out` is then a reference to that array.
