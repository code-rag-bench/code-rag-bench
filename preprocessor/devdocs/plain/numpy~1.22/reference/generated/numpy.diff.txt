# numpy.diff

numpy.diff(a, n=1, axis=-1, prepend=<no value>, append=<no value>)[source]

    
Calculate the n-th discrete difference along the given axis.

The first difference is given by `out[i] = a[i+1] - a[i]` along the given
axis, higher differences are calculated by using `diff` recursively.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Input array

nint, optional

    
The number of times values are differenced. If zero, the input is returned as-
is.

axisint, optional

    
The axis along which the difference is taken, default is the last axis.

prepend, appendarray_like, optional

    
Values to prepend or append to `a` along axis prior to performing the
difference. Scalar values are expanded to arrays with length 1 in the
direction of axis and the shape of the input array in along all other axes.
Otherwise the dimension and shape must match `a` except along axis.

New in version 1.16.0.

Returns

    
diffndarray

    
The n-th differences. The shape of the output is the same as `a` except along
`axis` where the dimension is smaller by `n`. The type of the output is the
same as the type of the difference between any two elements of `a`. This is
the same as the type of `a` in most cases. A notable exception is
`datetime64`, which results in a `timedelta64` output array.

#### Notes

Type is preserved for boolean arrays, so the result will contain `False` when
consecutive elements are the same and `True` when they differ.

For unsigned integer arrays, the results will also be unsigned. This should
not be surprising, as the result is consistent with calculating the difference
directly:

    
    >>> u8_arr = np.array([1, 0], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> np.diff(u8_arr)
    array([255], dtype=uint8)
    >>> u8_arr[1,...] - u8_arr[0,...]
    255
    
If this is not desirable, then the array should be cast to a larger integer
type first:

    
    >>> i16_arr = u8_arr.astype(np.int16)
    >>> np.diff(i16_arr)
    array([-1], dtype=int16)
    
#### Examples

    
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 4, 7, 0])
    >>> np.diff(x)
    array([ 1,  2,  3, -7])
    >>> np.diff(x, n=2)
    array([  1,   1, -10])
    
    
    >>> x = np.array([[1, 3, 6, 10], [0, 5, 6, 8]])
    >>> np.diff(x)
    array([[2, 3, 4],
           [5, 1, 2]])
    >>> np.diff(x, axis=0)
    array([[-1,  2,  0, -2]])
    
    
    >>> x = np.arange('1066-10-13', '1066-10-16', dtype=np.datetime64)
    >>> np.diff(x)
    array([1, 1], dtype='timedelta64[D]')
