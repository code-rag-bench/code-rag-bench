# numpy.vstack

numpy.vstack(tup)[source]

    
Stack arrays in sequence vertically (row wise).

This is equivalent to concatenation along the first axis after 1-D arrays of
shape `(N,)` have been reshaped to `(1,N)`. Rebuilds arrays divided by
`vsplit`.

This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For
instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis), and
r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` and `block`
provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

Parameters

    
tupsequence of ndarrays

    
The arrays must have the same shape along all but the first axis. 1-D arrays
must have the same length.

Returns

    
stackedndarray

    
The array formed by stacking the given arrays, will be at least 2-D.

See also

`concatenate`

    
Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.

`stack`

    
Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.

`block`

    
Assemble an nd-array from nested lists of blocks.

`hstack`

    
Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).

`dstack`

    
Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).

`column_stack`

    
Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.

`vsplit`

    
Split an array into multiple sub-arrays vertically (row-wise).

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.vstack((a,b))
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    
    
    >>> a = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])
    >>> b = np.array([[4], [5], [6]])
    >>> np.vstack((a,b))
    array([[1],
           [2],
           [3],
           [4],
           [5],
           [6]])
