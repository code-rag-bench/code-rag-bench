# numpy.linalg.matrix_rank

linalg.matrix_rank(A, tol=None, hermitian=False)[source]

    
Return matrix rank of array using SVD method

Rank of the array is the number of singular values of the array that are
greater than `tol`.

Changed in version 1.14: Can now operate on stacks of matrices

Parameters

    
A{(M,), (…, M, N)} array_like

    
Input vector or stack of matrices.

tol(…) array_like, float, optional

    
Threshold below which SVD values are considered zero. If `tol` is None, and
`S` is an array with singular values for `M`, and `eps` is the epsilon value
for datatype of `S`, then `tol` is set to `S.max() * max(M, N) * eps`.

Changed in version 1.14: Broadcasted against the stack of matrices

hermitianbool, optional

    
If True, `A` is assumed to be Hermitian (symmetric if real-valued), enabling a
more efficient method for finding singular values. Defaults to False.

New in version 1.14.

Returns

    
rank(…) array_like

    
Rank of A.

#### Notes

The default threshold to detect rank deficiency is a test on the magnitude of
the singular values of `A`. By default, we identify singular values less than
`S.max() * max(M, N) * eps` as indicating rank deficiency (with the symbols
defined above). This is the algorithm MATLAB uses [1]. It also appears in
Numerical recipes in the discussion of SVD solutions for linear least squares
[2].

This default threshold is designed to detect rank deficiency accounting for
the numerical errors of the SVD computation. Imagine that there is a column in
`A` that is an exact (in floating point) linear combination of other columns
in `A`. Computing the SVD on `A` will not produce a singular value exactly
equal to 0 in general: any difference of the smallest SVD value from 0 will be
caused by numerical imprecision in the calculation of the SVD. Our threshold
for small SVD values takes this numerical imprecision into account, and the
default threshold will detect such numerical rank deficiency. The threshold
may declare a matrix `A` rank deficient even if the linear combination of some
columns of `A` is not exactly equal to another column of `A` but only
numerically very close to another column of `A`.

We chose our default threshold because it is in wide use. Other thresholds are
possible. For example, elsewhere in the 2007 edition of Numerical recipes
there is an alternative threshold of `S.max() * np.finfo(A.dtype).eps / 2. *
np.sqrt(m + n + 1.)`. The authors describe this threshold as being based on
“expected roundoff error” (p 71).

The thresholds above deal with floating point roundoff error in the
calculation of the SVD. However, you may have more information about the
sources of error in `A` that would make you consider other tolerance values to
detect effective rank deficiency. The most useful measure of the tolerance
depends on the operations you intend to use on your matrix. For example, if
your data come from uncertain measurements with uncertainties greater than
floating point epsilon, choosing a tolerance near that uncertainty may be
preferable. The tolerance may be absolute if the uncertainties are absolute
rather than relative.

    >>> from numpy.linalg import matrix_rank
    >>> matrix_rank(np.eye(4)) # Full rank matrix
    4
    >>> I=np.eye(4); I[-1,-1] = 0. # rank deficient matrix
    >>> matrix_rank(I)
    3
    >>> matrix_rank(np.ones((4,))) # 1 dimension - rank 1 unless all 0
    1
    >>> matrix_rank(np.zeros((4,)))
    0
