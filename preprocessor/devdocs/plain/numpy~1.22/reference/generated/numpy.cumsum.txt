# numpy.cumsum

numpy.cumsum(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None)[source]

    
Return the cumulative sum of the elements along a given axis.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Input array.

axisint, optional

    
Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default (None) is to
compute the cumsum over the flattened array.

dtypedtype, optional

    
Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the elements are
summed. If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults to the dtype of `a`, unless
`a` has an integer dtype with a precision less than that of the default
platform integer. In that case, the default platform integer is used.

outndarray, optional

    
Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have the same
shape and buffer length as the expected output but the type will be cast if
necessary. See Output type determination for more details.

Returns

    
cumsum_along_axisndarray.

    
A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is specified, in which
case a reference to `out` is returned. The result has the same size as `a`,
and the same shape as `a` if `axis` is not None or `a` is a 1-d array.

See also

`sum`

    
Sum array elements.

`trapz`

    
Integration of array values using the composite trapezoidal rule.

`diff`

    
Calculate the n-th discrete difference along given axis.

#### Notes

Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is raised on
overflow.

`cumsum(a)[-1]` may not be equal to `sum(a)` for floating-point values since
`sum` may use a pairwise summation routine, reducing the roundoff-error. See
`sum` for more information.

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> a
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.cumsum(a)
    array([ 1,  3,  6, 10, 15, 21])
    >>> np.cumsum(a, dtype=float)     # specifies type of output value(s)
    array([  1.,   3.,   6.,  10.,  15.,  21.])
    
    
    >>> np.cumsum(a,axis=0)      # sum over rows for each of the 3 columns
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [5, 7, 9]])
    >>> np.cumsum(a,axis=1)      # sum over columns for each of the 2 rows
    array([[ 1,  3,  6],
           [ 4,  9, 15]])
    
`cumsum(b)[-1]` may not be equal to `sum(b)`

    
    >>> b = np.array([1, 2e-9, 3e-9] * 1000000)
    >>> b.cumsum()[-1]
    1000000.0050045159
    >>> b.sum()
    1000000.0050000029
