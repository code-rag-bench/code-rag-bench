# numpy.reshape

numpy.reshape(a, newshape, order='C')[source]

    
Gives a new shape to an array without changing its data.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Array to be reshaped.

newshapeint or tuple of ints

    
The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If an integer,
then the result will be a 1-D array of that length. One shape dimension can be
-1. In this case, the value is inferred from the length of the array and
remaining dimensions.

order{‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’}, optional

    
Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the elements into
the reshaped array using this index order. ‘C’ means to read / write the
elements using C-like index order, with the last axis index changing fastest,
back to the first axis index changing slowest. ‘F’ means to read / write the
elements using Fortran-like index order, with the first index changing
fastest, and the last index changing slowest. Note that the ‘C’ and ‘F’
options take no account of the memory layout of the underlying array, and only
refer to the order of indexing. ‘A’ means to read / write the elements in
Fortran-like index order if `a` is Fortran contiguous in memory, C-like order
otherwise.

Returns

    
reshaped_arrayndarray

    
This will be a new view object if possible; otherwise, it will be a copy. Note
there is no guarantee of the memory layout (C- or Fortran- contiguous) of the
returned array.

#### Notes

It is not always possible to change the shape of an array without copying the
data. If you want an error to be raised when the data is copied, you should
assign the new shape to the shape attribute of the array:

    
    >>> a = np.zeros((10, 2))
    
    # A transpose makes the array non-contiguous
    >>> b = a.T
    
    # Taking a view makes it possible to modify the shape without modifying
    # the initial object.
    >>> c = b.view()
    >>> c.shape = (20)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
    AttributeError: Incompatible shape for in-place modification. Use
    `.reshape()` to make a copy with the desired shape.
    
The `order` keyword gives the index ordering both for fetching the values from
`a`, and then placing the values into the output array. For example, let’s say
you have an array:

    
    >>> a = np.arange(6).reshape((3, 2))
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1],
           [2, 3],
           [4, 5]])
    
You can think of reshaping as first raveling the array (using the given index
order), then inserting the elements from the raveled array into the new array
using the same kind of index ordering as was used for the raveling.

    
    >>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3)) # C-like index ordering
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a), (2, 3)) # equivalent to C ravel then C reshape
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(a, (2, 3), order='F') # Fortran-like index ordering
    array([[0, 4, 3],
           [2, 1, 5]])
    >>> np.reshape(np.ravel(a, order='F'), (2, 3), order='F')
    array([[0, 4, 3],
           [2, 1, 5]])
    
#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.array([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]])
    >>> np.reshape(a, 6)
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> np.reshape(a, 6, order='F')
    array([1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6])
    
    
    >>> np.reshape(a, (3,-1))       # the unspecified value is inferred to be 2
    array([[1, 2],
           [3, 4],
           [5, 6]])
