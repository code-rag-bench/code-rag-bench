# numpy.poly

numpy.poly(seq_of_zeros)[source]

    
Find the coefficients of a polynomial with the given sequence of roots.

Note

This forms part of the old polynomial API. Since version 1.4, the new
polynomial API defined in `numpy.polynomial` is preferred. A summary of the
differences can be found in the transition guide.

Returns the coefficients of the polynomial whose leading coefficient is one
for the given sequence of zeros (multiple roots must be included in the
sequence as many times as their multiplicity; see Examples). A square matrix
(or array, which will be treated as a matrix) can also be given, in which case
the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix are returned.

Parameters

    
seq_of_zerosarray_like, shape (N,) or (N, N)

    
A sequence of polynomial roots, or a square array or matrix object.

Returns

    
cndarray

    
1D array of polynomial coefficients from highest to lowest degree:

`c[0] * x**(N) + c[1] * x**(N-1) + ... + c[N-1] * x + c[N]` where c[0] always
equals 1.

Raises

    
ValueError

    
If input is the wrong shape (the input must be a 1-D or square 2-D array).

See also

`polyval`

    
Compute polynomial values.

`roots`

    
Return the roots of a polynomial.

`polyfit`

    
Least squares polynomial fit.

`poly1d`

    
A one-dimensional polynomial class.

#### Notes

Specifying the roots of a polynomial still leaves one degree of freedom,
typically represented by an undetermined leading coefficient. [1] In the case
of this function, that coefficient - the first one in the returned array - is
always taken as one. (If for some reason you have one other point, the only
automatic way presently to leverage that information is to use `polyfit`.)

The characteristic polynomial, \\(p_a(t)\\), of an `n`-by-`n` matrix A is
given by

\\(p_a(t) = \mathrm{det}(t\, \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})\\),

where I is the `n`-by-`n` identity matrix. [2]

#### Examples

Given a sequence of a polynomial’s zeros:

    
    >>> np.poly((0, 0, 0)) # Multiple root example
    array([1., 0., 0., 0.])
    
The line above represents z**3 + 0*z**2 + 0*z + 0.

    
    >>> np.poly((-1./2, 0, 1./2))
    array([ 1.  ,  0.  , -0.25,  0.  ])
    
The line above represents z**3 - z/4

    
    >>> np.poly((np.random.random(1)[0], 0, np.random.random(1)[0]))
    array([ 1.        , -0.77086955,  0.08618131,  0.        ]) # random
    
Given a square array object:

    
    >>> P = np.array([[0, 1./3], [-1./2, 0]])
    >>> np.poly(P)
    array([1.        , 0.        , 0.16666667])
    
Note how in all cases the leading coefficient is always 1.
