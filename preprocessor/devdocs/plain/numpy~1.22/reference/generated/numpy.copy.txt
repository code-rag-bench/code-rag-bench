# numpy.copy

numpy.copy(a, order='K', subok=False)[source]

    
Return an array copy of the given object.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Input data.

order{‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’, ‘K’}, optional

    
Controls the memory layout of the copy. ‘C’ means C-order, ‘F’ means F-order,
‘A’ means ‘F’ if `a` is Fortran contiguous, ‘C’ otherwise. ‘K’ means match the
layout of `a` as closely as possible. (Note that this function and
`ndarray.copy` are very similar, but have different default values for their
order= arguments.)

subokbool, optional

    
If True, then sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise the returned array
will be forced to be a base-class array (defaults to False).

New in version 1.19.0.

Returns

    
arrndarray

    
Array interpretation of `a`.

Preferred method for creating an array copy

#### Notes

This is equivalent to:

    
    >>> np.array(a, copy=True)  
    
#### Examples

Create an array x, with a reference y and a copy z:

    
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> y = x
    >>> z = np.copy(x)
    
Note that, when we modify x, y changes, but not z:

    
    >>> x[0] = 10
    >>> x[0] == y[0]
    True
    >>> x[0] == z[0]
    False
    
Note that, np.copy clears previously set WRITEABLE=False flag.

    
    >>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    >>> a.flags["WRITEABLE"] = False
    >>> b = np.copy(a)
    >>> b.flags["WRITEABLE"]
    True
    >>> b[0] = 3
    >>> b
    array([3, 2, 3])
    
Note that np.copy is a shallow copy and will not copy object elements within
arrays. This is mainly important for arrays containing Python objects. The new
array will contain the same object which may lead to surprises if that object
can be modified (is mutable):

    
    >>> a = np.array([1, 'm', [2, 3, 4]], dtype=object)
    >>> b = np.copy(a)
    >>> b[2][0] = 10
    >>> a
    array([1, 'm', list([10, 3, 4])], dtype=object)
    
To ensure all elements within an `object` array are copied, use
`copy.deepcopy`:

    
    >>> import copy
    >>> a = np.array([1, 'm', [2, 3, 4]], dtype=object)
    >>> c = copy.deepcopy(a)
    >>> c[2][0] = 10
    >>> c
    array([1, 'm', list([10, 3, 4])], dtype=object)
    >>> a
    array([1, 'm', list([2, 3, 4])], dtype=object)
