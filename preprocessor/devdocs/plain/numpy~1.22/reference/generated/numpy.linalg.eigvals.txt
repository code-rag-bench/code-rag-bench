# numpy.linalg.eigvals

linalg.eigvals(a)[source]

    
Compute the eigenvalues of a general matrix.

Main difference between `eigvals` and `eig`: the eigenvectors aren’t returned.

Parameters

    
a(…, M, M) array_like

    
A complex- or real-valued matrix whose eigenvalues will be computed.

Returns

    
w(…, M,) ndarray

    
The eigenvalues, each repeated according to its multiplicity. They are not
necessarily ordered, nor are they necessarily real for real matrices.

Raises

    
LinAlgError

    
If the eigenvalue computation does not converge.

eigenvalues of real symmetric or complex Hermitian (conjugate symmetric)
arrays.

`eigh`

symmetric) arrays.

#### Notes

New in version 1.8.0.

Broadcasting rules apply, see the `numpy.linalg` documentation for details.

This is implemented using the `_geev` LAPACK routines which compute the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of general square arrays.

#### Examples

Illustration, using the fact that the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are its
diagonal elements, that multiplying a matrix on the left by an orthogonal
matrix, `Q`, and on the right by `Q.T` (the transpose of `Q`), preserves the
eigenvalues of the “middle” matrix. In other words, if `Q` is orthogonal, then
`Q * A * Q.T` has the same eigenvalues as `A`:

    
    >>> from numpy import linalg as LA
    >>> x = np.random.random()
    >>> Q = np.array([[np.cos(x), -np.sin(x)], [np.sin(x), np.cos(x)]])
    >>> LA.norm(Q[0, :]), LA.norm(Q[1, :]), np.dot(Q[0, :],Q[1, :])
    (1.0, 1.0, 0.0)
    
Now multiply a diagonal matrix by `Q` on one side and by `Q.T` on the other:

    
    >>> D = np.diag((-1,1))
    >>> LA.eigvals(D)
    array([-1.,  1.])
    >>> A = np.dot(Q, D)
    >>> A = np.dot(A, Q.T)
    >>> LA.eigvals(A)
    array([ 1., -1.]) # random
