# numpy.diag

numpy.diag(v, k=0)[source]

    
Extract a diagonal or construct a diagonal array.

See the more detailed documentation for `numpy.diagonal` if you use this
function to extract a diagonal and wish to write to the resulting array;
whether it returns a copy or a view depends on what version of numpy you are
using.

Parameters

    
varray_like

    
If `v` is a 2-D array, return a copy of its `k`-th diagonal. If `v` is a 1-D
array, return a 2-D array with `v` on the `k`-th diagonal.

kint, optional

    
Diagonal in question. The default is 0. Use `k>0` for diagonals above the main
diagonal, and `k<0` for diagonals below the main diagonal.

Returns

    
outndarray

    
The extracted diagonal or constructed diagonal array.

See also

`diagonal`

    
Return specified diagonals.

`diagflat`

    
Create a 2-D array with the flattened input as a diagonal.

`trace`

    
Sum along diagonals.

`triu`

    
Upper triangle of an array.

`tril`

    
Lower triangle of an array.

#### Examples

    
    >>> x = np.arange(9).reshape((3,3))
    >>> x
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])
    
    
    >>> np.diag(x)
    array([0, 4, 8])
    >>> np.diag(x, k=1)
    array([1, 5])
    >>> np.diag(x, k=-1)
    array([3, 7])
    
    
    >>> np.diag(np.diag(x))
    array([[0, 0, 0],
           [0, 4, 0],
           [0, 0, 8]])
