# numpy.dot

numpy.dot(a, b, out=None)

    
Dot product of two arrays. Specifically,

  * If both `a` and `b` are 1-D arrays, it is inner product of vectors (without complex conjugation).
  * If both `a` and `b` are 2-D arrays, it is matrix multiplication, but using `matmul` or `a @ b` is preferred.
  * If either `a` or `b` is 0-D (scalar), it is equivalent to `multiply` and using `numpy.multiply(a, b)` or `a * b` is preferred.
  * If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is a 1-D array, it is a sum product over the last axis of `a` and `b`.
  * If `a` is an N-D array and `b` is an M-D array (where `M>=2`), it is a sum product over the last axis of `a` and the second-to-last axis of `b`:
        dot(a, b)[i,j,k,m] = sum(a[i,j,:] * b[k,:,m])
    

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
First argument.

barray_like

    
Second argument.

outndarray, optional

    
Output argument. This must have the exact kind that would be returned if it
was not used. In particular, it must have the right type, must be
C-contiguous, and its dtype must be the dtype that would be returned for
`dot(a,b)`. This is a performance feature. Therefore, if these conditions are
not met, an exception is raised, instead of attempting to be flexible.

Returns

    
outputndarray

    
Returns the dot product of `a` and `b`. If `a` and `b` are both scalars or
both 1-D arrays then a scalar is returned; otherwise an array is returned. If
`out` is given, then it is returned.

Raises

    
ValueError

    
If the last dimension of `a` is not the same size as the second-to-last
dimension of `b`.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.dot(3, 4)
    12
    
Neither argument is complex-conjugated:

    
    >>> np.dot([2j, 3j], [2j, 3j])
    (-13+0j)
    
For 2-D arrays it is the matrix product:

    
    >>> a = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]
    >>> b = [[4, 1], [2, 2]]
    >>> np.dot(a, b)
    array([[4, 1],
           [2, 2]])
    
    
    >>> a = np.arange(3*4*5*6).reshape((3,4,5,6))
    >>> b = np.arange(3*4*5*6)[::-1].reshape((5,4,6,3))
    >>> np.dot(a, b)[2,3,2,1,2,2]
    499128
    >>> sum(a[2,3,2,:] * b[1,2,:,2])
    499128
