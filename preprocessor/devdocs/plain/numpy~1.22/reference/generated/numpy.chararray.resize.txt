# numpy.chararray.resize

method

chararray.resize(new_shape, refcheck=True)

    
Change shape and size of array in-place.

Parameters

    
new_shapetuple of ints, or `n` ints

    
Shape of resized array.

refcheckbool, optional

    
If False, reference count will not be checked. Default is True.

Returns

    
None

Raises

    
ValueError

    
If `a` does not own its own data or references or views to it exist, and the
data memory must be changed. PyPy only: will always raise if the data memory
must be changed, since there is no reliable way to determine if references or
views to it exist.

SystemError

    
If the `order` keyword argument is specified. This behaviour is a bug in
NumPy.

`resize`

    
Return a new array with the specified shape.

#### Notes

This reallocates space for the data area if necessary.

Only contiguous arrays (data elements consecutive in memory) can be resized.

The purpose of the reference count check is to make sure you do not use this
array as a buffer for another Python object and then reallocate the memory.
However, reference counts can increase in other ways so if you are sure that
you have not shared the memory for this array with another Python object, then
you may safely set `refcheck` to False.

#### Examples

Shrinking an array: array is flattened (in the order that the data are stored
in memory), resized, and reshaped:

    
    >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], order='C')
    >>> a.resize((2, 1))
    >>> a
    array([[0],
           [1]])
    
    
    >>> a = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]], order='F')
    >>> a.resize((2, 1))
    >>> a
    array([[0],
           [2]])
    
Enlarging an array: as above, but missing entries are filled with zeros:

    
    >>> b = np.array([[0, 1], [2, 3]])
    >>> b.resize(2, 3) # new_shape parameter doesn't have to be a tuple
    >>> b
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 0, 0]])
    
Referencing an array prevents resizing…

    
    >>> c = a
    >>> a.resize((1, 1))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: cannot resize an array that references or is referenced ...
    
Unless `refcheck` is False:

    
    >>> a.resize((1, 1), refcheck=False)
    >>> a
    array([[0]])
    >>> c
    array([[0]])
