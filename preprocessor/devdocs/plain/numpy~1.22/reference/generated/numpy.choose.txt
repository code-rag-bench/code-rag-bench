# numpy.choose

numpy.choose(a, choices, out=None, mode='raise')[source]

    
Construct an array from an index array and a list of arrays to choose from.

First of all, if confused or uncertain, definitely look at the Examples - in
its full generality, this function is less simple than it might seem from the
following code description (below ndi = `numpy.lib.index_tricks`):

`np.choose(a,c) == np.array([c[a[I]][I] for I in ndi.ndindex(a.shape)])`.

But this omits some subtleties. Here is a fully general summary:

Given an “index” array (`a`) of integers and a sequence of `n` arrays
(`choices`), `a` and each choice array are first broadcast, as necessary, to
arrays of a common shape; calling these Ba and Bchoices[i], i = 0,…,n-1 we
have that, necessarily, `Ba.shape == Bchoices[i].shape` for each `i`. Then, a
new array with shape `Ba.shape` is created as follows:

  * if `mode='raise'` (the default), then, first of all, each element of `a` (and thus `Ba`) must be in the range `[0, n-1]`; now, suppose that `i` (in that range) is the value at the `(j0, j1, ..., jm)` position in `Ba` \- then the value at the same position in the new array is the value in `Bchoices[i]` at that same position;
  * if `mode='wrap'`, values in `a` (and thus `Ba`) may be any (signed) integer; modular arithmetic is used to map integers outside the range `[0, n-1]` back into that range; and then the new array is constructed as above;
  * if `mode='clip'`, values in `a` (and thus `Ba`) may be any (signed) integer; negative integers are mapped to 0; values greater than `n-1` are mapped to `n-1`; and then the new array is constructed as above.

Parameters

    
aint array

    
This array must contain integers in `[0, n-1]`, where `n` is the number of
choices, unless `mode=wrap` or `mode=clip`, in which cases any integers are
permissible.

choicessequence of arrays

    
Choice arrays. `a` and all of the choices must be broadcastable to the same
shape. If `choices` is itself an array (not recommended), then its outermost
dimension (i.e., the one corresponding to `choices.shape[0]`) is taken as
defining the “sequence”.

outarray, optional

    
If provided, the result will be inserted into this array. It should be of the
appropriate shape and dtype. Note that `out` is always buffered if
`mode='raise'`; use other modes for better performance.

mode{‘raise’ (default), ‘wrap’, ‘clip’}, optional

    
Specifies how indices outside `[0, n-1]` will be treated:

  * ‘raise’ : an exception is raised
  * ‘wrap’ : value becomes value mod `n`
  * ‘clip’ : values < 0 are mapped to 0, values > n-1 are mapped to n-1

Returns

    
merged_arrayarray

    
The merged result.

Raises

    
ValueError: shape mismatch

    
If `a` and each choice array are not all broadcastable to the same shape.

equivalent method

`numpy.take_along_axis`

    
Preferable if `choices` is an array

#### Notes

To reduce the chance of misinterpretation, even though the following “abuse”
is nominally supported, `choices` should neither be, nor be thought of as, a
single array, i.e., the outermost sequence-like container should be either a
list or a tuple.

#### Examples

    
    >>> choices = [[0, 1, 2, 3], [10, 11, 12, 13],
    ...   [20, 21, 22, 23], [30, 31, 32, 33]]
    >>> np.choose([2, 3, 1, 0], choices
    ... # the first element of the result will be the first element of the
    ... # third (2+1) "array" in choices, namely, 20; the second element
    ... # will be the second element of the fourth (3+1) choice array, i.e.,
    ... # 31, etc.
    ... )
    array([20, 31, 12,  3])
    >>> np.choose([2, 4, 1, 0], choices, mode='clip') # 4 goes to 3 (4-1)
    array([20, 31, 12,  3])
    >>> # because there are 4 choice arrays
    >>> np.choose([2, 4, 1, 0], choices, mode='wrap') # 4 goes to (4 mod 4)
    array([20,  1, 12,  3])
    >>> # i.e., 0
    
A couple examples illustrating how choose broadcasts:

    
    >>> a = [[1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]]
    >>> choices = [-10, 10]
    >>> np.choose(a, choices)
    array([[ 10, -10,  10],
           [-10,  10, -10],
           [ 10, -10,  10]])
    
    
    >>> # With thanks to Anne Archibald
    >>> a = np.array([0, 1]).reshape((2,1,1))
    >>> c1 = np.array([1, 2, 3]).reshape((1,3,1))
    >>> c2 = np.array([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]).reshape((1,1,5))
    >>> np.choose(a, (c1, c2)) # result is 2x3x5, res[0,:,:]=c1, res[1,:,:]=c2
    array([[[ 1,  1,  1,  1,  1],
            [ 2,  2,  2,  2,  2],
            [ 3,  3,  3,  3,  3]],
           [[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5],
            [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5],
            [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]]])
