# numpy.ma.MaskedArray.item

method

ma.MaskedArray.item(*args)

    
Copy an element of an array to a standard Python scalar and return it.

Parameters

    
*argsArguments (variable number and type)
    
  * none: in this case, the method only works for arrays with one element (`a.size == 1`), which element is copied into a standard Python scalar object and returned.
  * int_type: this argument is interpreted as a flat index into the array, specifying which element to copy and return.
  * tuple of int_types: functions as does a single int_type argument, except that the argument is interpreted as an nd-index into the array.

Returns

    
zStandard Python scalar object

    
A copy of the specified element of the array as a suitable Python scalar

#### Notes

When the data type of `a` is longdouble or clongdouble, item() returns a
scalar array object because there is no available Python scalar that would not
lose information. Void arrays return a buffer object for item(), unless fields
are defined, in which case a tuple is returned.

`item` is very similar to a[args], except, instead of an array scalar, a
standard Python scalar is returned. This can be useful for speeding up access
to elements of the array and doing arithmetic on elements of the array using
Python’s optimized math.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.random.seed(123)
    >>> x = np.random.randint(9, size=(3, 3))
    >>> x
    array([[2, 2, 6],
           [1, 3, 6],
           [1, 0, 1]])
    >>> x.item(3)
    1
    >>> x.item(7)
    0
    >>> x.item((0, 1))
    2
    >>> x.item((2, 2))
    1
