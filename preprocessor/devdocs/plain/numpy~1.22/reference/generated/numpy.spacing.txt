# numpy.spacing

numpy.spacing(x, /, out=None, *, where=True, casting='same_kind', order='K',
dtype=None, subok=True[, signature, extobj]) = <ufunc 'spacing'>

    
Return the distance between x and the nearest adjacent number.

Parameters

    
xarray_like

    
Values to find the spacing of.

outndarray, None, or tuple of ndarray and None, optional

    
A location into which the result is stored. If provided, it must have a shape
that the inputs broadcast to. If not provided or None, a freshly-allocated
array is returned. A tuple (possible only as a keyword argument) must have
length equal to the number of outputs.

wherearray_like, optional

    
This condition is broadcast over the input. At locations where the condition
is True, the `out` array will be set to the ufunc result. Elsewhere, the `out`
array will retain its original value. Note that if an uninitialized `out`
array is created via the default `out=None`, locations within it where the
condition is False will remain uninitialized.

**kwargs

    
For other keyword-only arguments, see the ufunc docs.

Returns

    
outndarray or scalar

    
The spacing of values of `x`. This is a scalar if `x` is a scalar.

#### Notes

It can be considered as a generalization of EPS: `spacing(np.float64(1)) ==
np.finfo(np.float64).eps`, and there should not be any representable number
between `x + spacing(x)` and x for any finite x.

Spacing of +- inf and NaN is NaN.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.spacing(1) == np.finfo(np.float64).eps
    True
