# numpy.nancumsum

numpy.nancumsum(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None)[source]

    
Return the cumulative sum of array elements over a given axis treating Not a
Numbers (NaNs) as zero. The cumulative sum does not change when NaNs are
encountered and leading NaNs are replaced by zeros.

Zeros are returned for slices that are all-NaN or empty.

New in version 1.12.0.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Input array.

axisint, optional

    
Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default (None) is to
compute the cumsum over the flattened array.

dtypedtype, optional

    
Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the elements are
summed. If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults to the dtype of `a`, unless
`a` has an integer dtype with a precision less than that of the default
platform integer. In that case, the default platform integer is used.

outndarray, optional

    
Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have the same
shape and buffer length as the expected output but the type will be cast if
necessary. See Output type determination for more details.

Returns

    
nancumsumndarray.

    
A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is specified, in which
it is returned. The result has the same size as `a`, and the same shape as `a`
if `axis` is not None or `a` is a 1-d array.

`numpy.cumsum`

    
Cumulative sum across array propagating NaNs.

`isnan`

    
Show which elements are NaN.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.nancumsum(1)
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumsum([1])
    array([1])
    >>> np.nancumsum([1, np.nan])
    array([1.,  1.])
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nancumsum(a)
    array([1.,  3.,  6.,  6.])
    >>> np.nancumsum(a, axis=0)
    array([[1.,  2.],
           [4.,  2.]])
    >>> np.nancumsum(a, axis=1)
    array([[1.,  3.],
           [3.,  3.]])
