# numpy.recarray.itemset

method

recarray.itemset(*args)

    
Insert scalar into an array (scalar is cast to array’s dtype, if possible)

There must be at least 1 argument, and define the last argument as item. Then,
`a.itemset(*args)` is equivalent to but faster than `a[args] = item`. The item
should be a scalar value and `args` must select a single item in the array
`a`.

Parameters

    
*argsArguments
    
If one argument: a scalar, only used in case `a` is of size 1. If two
arguments: the last argument is the value to be set and must be a scalar, the
first argument specifies a single array element location. It is either an int
or a tuple.

#### Notes

Compared to indexing syntax, `itemset` provides some speed increase for
placing a scalar into a particular location in an `ndarray`, if you must do
this. However, generally this is discouraged: among other problems, it
complicates the appearance of the code. Also, when using `itemset` (and
`item`) inside a loop, be sure to assign the methods to a local variable to
avoid the attribute look-up at each loop iteration.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.random.seed(123)
    >>> x = np.random.randint(9, size=(3, 3))
    >>> x
    array([[2, 2, 6],
           [1, 3, 6],
           [1, 0, 1]])
    >>> x.itemset(4, 0)
    >>> x.itemset((2, 2), 9)
    >>> x
    array([[2, 2, 6],
           [1, 0, 6],
           [1, 0, 9]])
