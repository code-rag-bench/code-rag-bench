# numpy.polynomial.hermite_e.hermeone

polynomial.hermite_e.hermeone = array([1])

    
An array object represents a multidimensional, homogeneous array of fixed-size
items. An associated data-type object describes the format of each element in
the array (its byte-order, how many bytes it occupies in memory, whether it is
an integer, a floating point number, or something else, etc.)

Arrays should be constructed using `array`, `zeros` or `empty` (refer to the
See Also section below). The parameters given here refer to a low-level method
(`ndarray(…)`) for instantiating an array.

For more information, refer to the `numpy` module and examine the methods and
attributes of an array.

Parameters

    
(for the __new__ method; see Notes below)

shapetuple of ints

    
Shape of created array.

dtypedata-type, optional

    
Any object that can be interpreted as a numpy data type.

bufferobject exposing buffer interface, optional

    
Used to fill the array with data.

offsetint, optional

    
Offset of array data in buffer.

stridestuple of ints, optional

    
Strides of data in memory.

order{‘C’, ‘F’}, optional

    
Row-major (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order.

See also

`array`

    
Construct an array.

`zeros`

    
Create an array, each element of which is zero.

`empty`

    
Create an array, but leave its allocated memory unchanged (i.e., it contains
“garbage”).

`dtype`

    
Create a data-type.

`numpy.typing.NDArray`

    
An ndarray alias generic w.r.t. its `dtype.type`.

#### Notes

There are two modes of creating an array using `__new__`:

  1. If `buffer` is None, then only `shape`, `dtype`, and `order` are used.
  2. If `buffer` is an object exposing the buffer interface, then all keywords are interpreted.

No `__init__` method is needed because the array is fully initialized after
the `__new__` method.

#### Examples

These examples illustrate the low-level `ndarray` constructor. Refer to the
`See Also` section above for easier ways of constructing an ndarray.

First mode, `buffer` is None:

    
    >>> np.ndarray(shape=(2,2), dtype=float, order='F')
    array([[0.0e+000, 0.0e+000], # random
           [     nan, 2.5e-323]])
    
Second mode:

    
    >>> np.ndarray((2,), buffer=np.array([1,2,3]),
    ...            offset=np.int_().itemsize,
    ...            dtype=int) # offset = 1*itemsize, i.e. skip first element
    array([2, 3])
    
Attributes

    
Tndarray

    
Transpose of the array.

databuffer

    
The array’s elements, in memory.

dtypedtype object

    
Describes the format of the elements in the array.

flagsdict

    
Dictionary containing information related to memory use, e.g., ‘C_CONTIGUOUS’,
‘OWNDATA’, ‘WRITEABLE’, etc.

flatnumpy.flatiter object

    
Flattened version of the array as an iterator. The iterator allows
assignments, e.g., `x.flat = 3` (See `ndarray.flat` for assignment examples;
TODO).

imagndarray

    
Imaginary part of the array.

realndarray

    
Real part of the array.

sizeint

    
Number of elements in the array.

itemsizeint

    
The memory use of each array element in bytes.

nbytesint

    
The total number of bytes required to store the array data, i.e., `itemsize *
size`.

ndimint

    
The array’s number of dimensions.

shapetuple of ints

    
Shape of the array.

stridestuple of ints

    
The step-size required to move from one element to the next in memory. For
example, a contiguous `(3, 4)` array of type `int16` in C-order has strides
`(8, 2)`. This implies that to move from element to element in memory requires
jumps of 2 bytes. To move from row-to-row, one needs to jump 8 bytes at a time
(`2 * 4`).

ctypesctypes object

    
Class containing properties of the array needed for interaction with ctypes.

basendarray

    
If the array is a view into another array, that array is its `base` (unless
that array is also a view). The `base` array is where the array data is
actually stored.
