# numpy.hstack

numpy.hstack(tup)[source]

    
Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).

This is equivalent to concatenation along the second axis, except for 1-D
arrays where it concatenates along the first axis. Rebuilds arrays divided by
`hsplit`.

This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For
instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis), and
r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, `stack` and `block`
provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

Parameters

    
tupsequence of ndarrays

    
The arrays must have the same shape along all but the second axis, except 1-D
arrays which can be any length.

Returns

    
stackedndarray

    
The array formed by stacking the given arrays.

See also

`concatenate`

    
Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.

`stack`

    
Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.

`block`

    
Assemble an nd-array from nested lists of blocks.

`vstack`

    
Stack arrays in sequence vertically (row wise).

`dstack`

    
Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).

`column_stack`

    
Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.

`hsplit`

    
Split an array into multiple sub-arrays horizontally (column-wise).

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.array((1,2,3))
    >>> b = np.array((4,5,6))
    >>> np.hstack((a,b))
    array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    >>> a = np.array([[1],[2],[3]])
    >>> b = np.array([[4],[5],[6]])
    >>> np.hstack((a,b))
    array([[1, 4],
           [2, 5],
           [3, 6]])
