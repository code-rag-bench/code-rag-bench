# numpy.prod

numpy.prod(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=<no value>,
initial=<no value>, where=<no value>)[source]

    
Return the product of array elements over a given axis.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Input data.

axisNone or int or tuple of ints, optional

    
Axis or axes along which a product is performed. The default, axis=None, will
calculate the product of all the elements in the input array. If axis is
negative it counts from the last to the first axis.

New in version 1.7.0.

If axis is a tuple of ints, a product is performed on all of the axes
specified in the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.

dtypedtype, optional

    
The type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator in which the
elements are multiplied. The dtype of `a` is used by default unless `a` has an
integer dtype of less precision than the default platform integer. In that
case, if `a` is signed then the platform integer is used while if `a` is
unsigned then an unsigned integer of the same precision as the platform
integer is used.

outndarray, optional

    
Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have the same
shape as the expected output, but the type of the output values will be cast
if necessary.

keepdimsbool, optional

    
If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as
dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast
correctly against the input array.

If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be passed through to
the `prod` method of sub-classes of `ndarray`, however any non-default value
will be. If the sub-class’ method does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions
will be raised.

initialscalar, optional

    
The starting value for this product. See `reduce` for details.

New in version 1.15.0.

wherearray_like of bool, optional

    
Elements to include in the product. See `reduce` for details.

New in version 1.17.0.

Returns

    
product_along_axisndarray, see `dtype` parameter above.

    
An array shaped as `a` but with the specified axis removed. Returns a
reference to `out` if specified.

Output type determination

#### Notes

Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is raised on
overflow. That means that, on a 32-bit platform:

    
    >>> x = np.array([536870910, 536870910, 536870910, 536870910])
    >>> np.prod(x)
    16 # may vary
    
The product of an empty array is the neutral element 1:

    
    >>> np.prod([])
    1.0
    
#### Examples

By default, calculate the product of all elements:

    
    >>> np.prod([1.,2.])
    2.0
    
Even when the input array is two-dimensional:

    
    >>> np.prod([[1.,2.],[3.,4.]])
    24.0
    
But we can also specify the axis over which to multiply:

    
    >>> np.prod([[1.,2.],[3.,4.]], axis=1)
    array([  2.,  12.])
    
Or select specific elements to include:

    
    >>> np.prod([1., np.nan, 3.], where=[True, False, True])
    3.0
    
If the type of `x` is unsigned, then the output type is the unsigned platform
integer:

    
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.uint8)
    >>> np.prod(x).dtype == np.uint
    True
    
If `x` is of a signed integer type, then the output type is the default
platform integer:

    
    >>> x = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.int8)
    >>> np.prod(x).dtype == int
    True
    
You can also start the product with a value other than one:

    
    >>> np.prod([1, 2], initial=5)
    10
