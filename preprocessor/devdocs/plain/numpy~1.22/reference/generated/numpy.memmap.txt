# numpy.memmap

class numpy.memmap(filename, dtype=<class 'numpy.ubyte'>, mode='r+', offset=0,
shape=None, order='C')[source]

    
Create a memory-map to an array stored in a binary file on disk.

Memory-mapped files are used for accessing small segments of large files on
disk, without reading the entire file into memory. NumPy’s memmap’s are array-
like objects. This differs from Python’s `mmap` module, which uses file-like
objects.

This subclass of ndarray has some unpleasant interactions with some
operations, because it doesn’t quite fit properly as a subclass. An
alternative to using this subclass is to create the `mmap` object yourself,
then create an ndarray with ndarray.__new__ directly, passing the object
created in its ‘buffer=’ parameter.

This class may at some point be turned into a factory function which returns a
view into an mmap buffer.

Flush the memmap instance to write the changes to the file. Currently there is
no API to close the underlying `mmap`. It is tricky to ensure the resource is
actually closed, since it may be shared between different memmap instances.

Parameters

    
filenamestr, file-like object, or pathlib.Path instance

    
The file name or file object to be used as the array data buffer.

dtypedata-type, optional

    
The data-type used to interpret the file contents. Default is `uint8`.

mode{‘r+’, ‘r’, ‘w+’, ‘c’}, optional

    
The file is opened in this mode:

‘r’ | Open existing file for reading only.  
---|---  
‘r+’ | Open existing file for reading and writing.  
‘w+’ | Create or overwrite existing file for reading and writing.  
‘c’ | Copy-on-write: assignments affect data in memory, but changes are not saved to disk. The file on disk is read-only.  
Default is ‘r+’.

offsetint, optional

    
In the file, array data starts at this offset. Since `offset` is measured in
bytes, it should normally be a multiple of the byte-size of `dtype`. When
`mode != 'r'`, even positive offsets beyond end of file are valid; The file
will be extended to accommodate the additional data. By default, `memmap` will
start at the beginning of the file, even if `filename` is a file pointer `fp`
and `fp.tell() != 0`.

shapetuple, optional

    
The desired shape of the array. If `mode == 'r'` and the number of remaining
bytes after `offset` is not a multiple of the byte-size of `dtype`, you must
specify `shape`. By default, the returned array will be 1-D with the number of
elements determined by file size and data-type.

order{‘C’, ‘F’}, optional

    
Specify the order of the ndarray memory layout: row-major, C-style or column-
major, Fortran-style. This only has an effect if the shape is greater than
1-D. The default order is ‘C’.

Create or load a memory-mapped `.npy` file.

#### Notes

The memmap object can be used anywhere an ndarray is accepted. Given a memmap
`fp`, `isinstance(fp, numpy.ndarray)` returns `True`.

Memory-mapped files cannot be larger than 2GB on 32-bit systems.

When a memmap causes a file to be created or extended beyond its current size
in the filesystem, the contents of the new part are unspecified. On systems
with POSIX filesystem semantics, the extended part will be filled with zero
bytes.

#### Examples

    
    >>> data = np.arange(12, dtype='float32')
    >>> data.resize((3,4))
    
This example uses a temporary file so that doctest doesn’t write files to your
directory. You would use a ‘normal’ filename.

    
    >>> from tempfile import mkdtemp
    >>> import os.path as path
    >>> filename = path.join(mkdtemp(), 'newfile.dat')
    
Create a memmap with dtype and shape that matches our data:

    
    >>> fp = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float32', mode='w+', shape=(3,4))
    >>> fp
    memmap([[0., 0., 0., 0.],
            [0., 0., 0., 0.],
            [0., 0., 0., 0.]], dtype=float32)
    
Write data to memmap array:

    
    >>> fp[:] = data[:]
    >>> fp
    memmap([[  0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
            [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
            [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.]], dtype=float32)
    
    
    >>> fp.filename == path.abspath(filename)
    True
    
Flushes memory changes to disk in order to read them back

    
    >>> fp.flush()
    
Load the memmap and verify data was stored:

    
    >>> newfp = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float32', mode='r', shape=(3,4))
    >>> newfp
    memmap([[  0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
            [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
            [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.]], dtype=float32)
    
Read-only memmap:

    
    >>> fpr = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float32', mode='r', shape=(3,4))
    >>> fpr.flags.writeable
    False
    
Copy-on-write memmap:

    
    >>> fpc = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float32', mode='c', shape=(3,4))
    >>> fpc.flags.writeable
    True
    
It’s possible to assign to copy-on-write array, but values are only written
into the memory copy of the array, and not written to disk:

    
    >>> fpc
    memmap([[  0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
            [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
            [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.]], dtype=float32)
    >>> fpc[0,:] = 0
    >>> fpc
    memmap([[  0.,   0.,   0.,   0.],
            [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
            [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.]], dtype=float32)
    
File on disk is unchanged:

    
    >>> fpr
    memmap([[  0.,   1.,   2.,   3.],
            [  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.],
            [  8.,   9.,  10.,  11.]], dtype=float32)
    
Offset into a memmap:

    
    >>> fpo = np.memmap(filename, dtype='float32', mode='r', offset=16)
    >>> fpo
    memmap([  4.,   5.,   6.,   7.,   8.,   9.,  10.,  11.], dtype=float32)
    
Attributes

    
filenamestr or pathlib.Path instance

    
Path to the mapped file.

offsetint

    
Offset position in the file.

modestr

    
File mode.
