# numpy.matrix.ravel

method

matrix.ravel(order='C')[source]

    
Return a flattened matrix.

Refer to `numpy.ravel` for more documentation.

Parameters

    
order{‘C’, ‘F’, ‘A’, ‘K’}, optional

    
The elements of `m` are read using this index order. ‘C’ means to index the
elements in C-like order, with the last axis index changing fastest, back to
the first axis index changing slowest. ‘F’ means to index the elements in
Fortran-like index order, with the first index changing fastest, and the last
index changing slowest. Note that the ‘C’ and ‘F’ options take no account of
the memory layout of the underlying array, and only refer to the order of axis
indexing. ‘A’ means to read the elements in Fortran-like index order if `m` is
Fortran contiguous in memory, C-like order otherwise. ‘K’ means to read the
elements in the order they occur in memory, except for reversing the data when
strides are negative. By default, ‘C’ index order is used.

Returns

    
retmatrix

    
Return the matrix flattened to shape `(1, N)` where `N` is the number of
elements in the original matrix. A copy is made only if necessary.
