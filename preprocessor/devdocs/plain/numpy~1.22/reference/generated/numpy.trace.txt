# numpy.trace

numpy.trace(a, offset=0, axis1=0, axis2=1, dtype=None, out=None)[source]

    
Return the sum along diagonals of the array.

If `a` is 2-D, the sum along its diagonal with the given offset is returned,
i.e., the sum of elements `a[i,i+offset]` for all i.

If `a` has more than two dimensions, then the axes specified by axis1 and
axis2 are used to determine the 2-D sub-arrays whose traces are returned. The
shape of the resulting array is the same as that of `a` with `axis1` and
`axis2` removed.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Input array, from which the diagonals are taken.

offsetint, optional

    
Offset of the diagonal from the main diagonal. Can be both positive and
negative. Defaults to 0.

axis1, axis2int, optional

    
Axes to be used as the first and second axis of the 2-D sub-arrays from which
the diagonals should be taken. Defaults are the first two axes of `a`.

dtypedtype, optional

    
Determines the data-type of the returned array and of the accumulator where
the elements are summed. If dtype has the value None and `a` is of integer
type of precision less than the default integer precision, then the default
integer precision is used. Otherwise, the precision is the same as that of
`a`.

outndarray, optional

    
Array into which the output is placed. Its type is preserved and it must be of
the right shape to hold the output.

Returns

    
sum_along_diagonalsndarray

    
If `a` is 2-D, the sum along the diagonal is returned. If `a` has larger
dimensions, then an array of sums along diagonals is returned.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.trace(np.eye(3))
    3.0
    >>> a = np.arange(8).reshape((2,2,2))
    >>> np.trace(a)
    array([6, 8])
    
    
    >>> a = np.arange(24).reshape((2,2,2,3))
    >>> np.trace(a).shape
    (2, 3)
