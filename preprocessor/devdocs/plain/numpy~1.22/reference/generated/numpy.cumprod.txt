# numpy.cumprod

numpy.cumprod(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None)[source]

    
Return the cumulative product of elements along a given axis.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Input array.

axisint, optional

    
Axis along which the cumulative product is computed. By default the input is
flattened.

dtypedtype, optional

    
Type of the returned array, as well as of the accumulator in which the
elements are multiplied. If dtype is not specified, it defaults to the dtype
of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with a precision less than that of the
default platform integer. In that case, the default platform integer is used
instead.

outndarray, optional

    
Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have the same
shape and buffer length as the expected output but the type of the resulting
values will be cast if necessary.

Returns

    
cumprodndarray

    
A new array holding the result is returned unless `out` is specified, in which
case a reference to out is returned.

#### Notes

Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is raised on
overflow.

#### Examples

    
    >>> a = np.array([1,2,3])
    >>> np.cumprod(a) # intermediate results 1, 1*2
    ...               # total product 1*2*3 = 6
    array([1, 2, 6])
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> np.cumprod(a, dtype=float) # specify type of output
    array([   1.,    2.,    6.,   24.,  120.,  720.])
    
The cumulative product for each column (i.e., over the rows) of `a`:

    
    >>> np.cumprod(a, axis=0)
    array([[ 1,  2,  3],
           [ 4, 10, 18]])
    
The cumulative product for each row (i.e. over the columns) of `a`:

    
    >>> np.cumprod(a,axis=1)
    array([[  1,   2,   6],
           [  4,  20, 120]])
