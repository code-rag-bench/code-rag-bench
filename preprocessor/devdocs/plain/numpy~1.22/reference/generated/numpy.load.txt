# numpy.load

numpy.load(file, mmap_mode=None, allow_pickle=False, fix_imports=True,
encoding='ASCII')[source]

    
Load arrays or pickled objects from `.npy`, `.npz` or pickled files.

Warning

Loading files that contain object arrays uses the `pickle` module, which is
not secure against erroneous or maliciously constructed data. Consider passing
`allow_pickle=False` to load data that is known not to contain object arrays
for the safer handling of untrusted sources.

Parameters

    
filefile-like object, string, or pathlib.Path

    
The file to read. File-like objects must support the `seek()` and `read()`
methods. Pickled files require that the file-like object support the
`readline()` method as well.

mmap_mode{None, ‘r+’, ‘r’, ‘w+’, ‘c’}, optional

    
If not None, then memory-map the file, using the given mode (see
`numpy.memmap` for a detailed description of the modes). A memory-mapped array
is kept on disk. However, it can be accessed and sliced like any ndarray.
Memory mapping is especially useful for accessing small fragments of large
files without reading the entire file into memory.

allow_picklebool, optional

    
Allow loading pickled object arrays stored in npy files. Reasons for
disallowing pickles include security, as loading pickled data can execute
arbitrary code. If pickles are disallowed, loading object arrays will fail.
Default: False

Changed in version 1.16.3: Made default False in response to CVE-2019-6446.

fix_importsbool, optional

    
Only useful when loading Python 2 generated pickled files on Python 3, which
includes npy/npz files containing object arrays. If `fix_imports` is True,
pickle will try to map the old Python 2 names to the new names used in Python
3.

encodingstr, optional

    
What encoding to use when reading Python 2 strings. Only useful when loading
Python 2 generated pickled files in Python 3, which includes npy/npz files
containing object arrays. Values other than ‘latin1’, ‘ASCII’, and ‘bytes’ are
not allowed, as they can corrupt numerical data. Default: ‘ASCII’

Returns

    
resultarray, tuple, dict, etc.

    
Data stored in the file. For `.npz` files, the returned instance of NpzFile
class must be closed to avoid leaking file descriptors.

Raises

    
OSError

    
If the input file does not exist or cannot be read.

UnpicklingError

    
If `allow_pickle=True`, but the file cannot be loaded as a pickle.

ValueError

    
The file contains an object array, but `allow_pickle=False` given.

`save`, `savez`, `savez_compressed`, `loadtxt`

`memmap`

    
Create a memory-map to an array stored in a file on disk.

`lib.format.open_memmap`

    
Create or load a memory-mapped `.npy` file.

#### Notes

  * If the file contains pickle data, then whatever object is stored in the pickle is returned.
  * If the file is a `.npy` file, then a single array is returned.
  * If the file is a `.npz` file, then a dictionary-like object is returned, containing `{filename: array}` key-value pairs, one for each file in the archive.
  * If the file is a `.npz` file, the returned value supports the context manager protocol in a similar fashion to the open function:
        with load('foo.npz') as data:
        a = data['a']
    
The underlying file descriptor is closed when exiting the ‘with’ block.

#### Examples

Store data to disk, and load it again:

    
    >>> np.save('/tmp/123', np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]))
    >>> np.load('/tmp/123.npy')
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    
Store compressed data to disk, and load it again:

    
    >>> a=np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> b=np.array([1, 2])
    >>> np.savez('/tmp/123.npz', a=a, b=b)
    >>> data = np.load('/tmp/123.npz')
    >>> data['a']
    array([[1, 2, 3],
           [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> data['b']
    array([1, 2])
    >>> data.close()
    
Mem-map the stored array, and then access the second row directly from disk:

    
    >>> X = np.load('/tmp/123.npy', mmap_mode='r')
    >>> X[1, :]
    memmap([4, 5, 6])
