# numpy.sum

numpy.sum(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=<no value>, initial=<no
value>, where=<no value>)[source]

    
Sum of array elements over a given axis.

Parameters

    
aarray_like

    
Elements to sum.

axisNone or int or tuple of ints, optional

    
Axis or axes along which a sum is performed. The default, axis=None, will sum
all of the elements of the input array. If axis is negative it counts from the
last to the first axis.

New in version 1.7.0.

If axis is a tuple of ints, a sum is performed on all of the axes specified in
the tuple instead of a single axis or all the axes as before.

dtypedtype, optional

    
The type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the elements
are summed. The dtype of `a` is used by default unless `a` has an integer
dtype of less precision than the default platform integer. In that case, if
`a` is signed then the platform integer is used while if `a` is unsigned then
an unsigned integer of the same precision as the platform integer is used.

outndarray, optional

    
Alternative output array in which to place the result. It must have the same
shape as the expected output, but the type of the output values will be cast
if necessary.

keepdimsbool, optional

    
If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left in the result as
dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast
correctly against the input array.

If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be passed through to
the `sum` method of sub-classes of `ndarray`, however any non-default value
will be. If the sub-class’ method does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions
will be raised.

initialscalar, optional

    
Starting value for the sum. See `reduce` for details.

New in version 1.15.0.

wherearray_like of bool, optional

    
Elements to include in the sum. See `reduce` for details.

New in version 1.17.0.

Returns

    
sum_along_axisndarray

    
An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis removed. If `a`
is a 0-d array, or if `axis` is None, a scalar is returned. If an output array
is specified, a reference to `out` is returned.

#### Notes

Arithmetic is modular when using integer types, and no error is raised on
overflow.

The sum of an empty array is the neutral element 0:

    
    >>> np.sum([])
    0.0
    
For floating point numbers the numerical precision of sum (and
`np.add.reduce`) is in general limited by directly adding each number
individually to the result causing rounding errors in every step. However,
often numpy will use a numerically better approach (partial pairwise
summation) leading to improved precision in many use-cases. This improved
precision is always provided when no `axis` is given. When `axis` is given, it
will depend on which axis is summed. Technically, to provide the best speed
possible, the improved precision is only used when the summation is along the
fast axis in memory. Note that the exact precision may vary depending on other
parameters. In contrast to NumPy, Python’s `math.fsum` function uses a slower
but more precise approach to summation. Especially when summing a large number
of lower precision floating point numbers, such as `float32`, numerical errors
can become significant. In such cases it can be advisable to use
`dtype=”float64”` to use a higher precision for the output.

#### Examples

    
    >>> np.sum([0.5, 1.5])
    2.0
    >>> np.sum([0.5, 0.7, 0.2, 1.5], dtype=np.int32)
    1
    >>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]])
    6
    >>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]], axis=0)
    array([0, 6])
    >>> np.sum([[0, 1], [0, 5]], axis=1)
    array([1, 5])
    >>> np.sum([[0, 1], [np.nan, 5]], where=[False, True], axis=1)
    array([1., 5.])
    
If the accumulator is too small, overflow occurs:

    
    >>> np.ones(128, dtype=np.int8).sum(dtype=np.int8)
    -128
    
You can also start the sum with a value other than zero:

    
    >>> np.sum([10], initial=5)
    15
