<h1 id="tutorial-3-class-based-views">Tutorial 3: Class-based Views</h1> <p>We can also write our API views using class-based views, rather than function based views. As we'll see this is a powerful pattern that allows us to reuse common functionality, and helps us keep our code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>.</p> <h2 id="rewriting-our-api-using-class-based-views">Rewriting our API using class-based views</h2> <p>We'll start by rewriting the root view as a class-based view. All this involves is a little bit of refactoring of <code>views.py</code>.</p> <pre data-language="python">from snippets.models import Snippet
from snippets.serializers import SnippetSerializer
from django.http import Http404
from rest_framework.views import APIView
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status


class SnippetList(APIView):
    """
    List all snippets, or create a new snippet.
    """
    def get(self, request, format=None):
        snippets = Snippet.objects.all()
        serializer = SnippetSerializer(snippets, many=True)
        return Response(serializer.data)

    def post(self, request, format=None):

        return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)
</pre> <p>So far, so good. It looks pretty similar to the previous case, but we've got better separation between the different HTTP methods. We'll also need to update the instance view in <code>views.py</code>.</p> <pre data-language="python">class SnippetDetail(APIView):
    """
    Retrieve, update or delete a snippet instance.
    """
    def get_object(self, pk):
        try:
            return Snippet.objects.get(pk=pk)
        except Snippet.DoesNotExist:
            raise Http404

    def get(self, request, pk, format=None):
        snippet = self.get_object(pk)
        serializer = SnippetSerializer(snippet)

        snippet.delete()
        return Response(status=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
</pre> <p>That's looking good. Again, it's still pretty similar to the function based view right now.</p> <p>We'll also need to refactor our <code>snippets/urls.py</code> slightly now that we're using class-based views.</p> <pre data-language="python">from django.urls import path
from rest_framework.urlpatterns import format_suffix_patterns
from snippets import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('snippets/', views.SnippetList.as_view()),
    path('snippets/&lt;int:pk&gt;/', views.SnippetDetail.as_view()),
]

urlpatterns = format_suffix_patterns(urlpatterns)
</pre> <p>Okay, we're done. If you run the development server everything should be working just as before.</p> <h2 id="using-mixins">Using mixins</h2> <p>One of the big wins of using class-based views is that it allows us to easily compose reusable bits of behaviour.</p> <p>The create/retrieve/update/delete operations that we've been using so far are going to be pretty similar for any model-backed API views we create. Those bits of common behaviour are implemented in REST framework's mixin classes.</p> <p>Let's take a look at how we can compose the views by using the mixin classes. Here's our <code>views.py</code> module again.</p> <pre data-language="python">from snippets.models import Snippet
from snippets.serializers import SnippetSerializer
from rest_framework import mixins
from rest_framework import generics

class SnippetList(mixins.ListModelMixin,
                  mixins.CreateModelMixin,
                  generics.GenericAPIView):
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SnippetSerializer

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.list(request, *args, **kwargs)

    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.create(request, *args, **kwargs)
</pre> <p>We'll take a moment to examine exactly what's happening here. We're building our view using <code>GenericAPIView</code>, and adding in <code>ListModelMixin</code> and <code>CreateModelMixin</code>.</p> <p>The base class provides the core functionality, and the mixin classes provide the <code>.list()</code> and <code>.create()</code> actions. We're then explicitly binding the <code>get</code> and <code>post</code> methods to the appropriate actions. Simple enough stuff so far.</p> <pre data-language="python">class SnippetDetail(mixins.RetrieveModelMixin,
                    mixins.UpdateModelMixin,
                    mixins.DestroyModelMixin,
                    generics.GenericAPIView):
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SnippetSerializer

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.retrieve(request, *args, **kwargs)

    def put(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.update(request, *args, **kwargs)

    def delete(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.destroy(request, *args, **kwargs)
</pre> <p>Pretty similar. Again we're using the <code>GenericAPIView</code> class to provide the core functionality, and adding in mixins to provide the <code>.retrieve()</code>, <code>.update()</code> and <code>.destroy()</code> actions.</p> <h2 id="using-generic-class-based-views">Using generic class-based views</h2> <p>Using the mixin classes we've rewritten the views to use slightly less code than before, but we can go one step further. REST framework provides a set of already mixed-in generic views that we can use to trim down our <code>views.py</code> module even more.</p> <pre data-language="python">from snippets.models import Snippet
from snippets.serializers import SnippetSerializer
from rest_framework import generics


class SnippetList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SnippetSerializer


class SnippetDetail(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    queryset = Snippet.objects.all()
    serializer_class = SnippetSerializer
</pre> <p>Wow, that's pretty concise. We've gotten a huge amount for free, and our code looks like good, clean, idiomatic Django.</p> <p>Next we'll move onto <a href="../4-authentication-and-permissions/index">part 4 of the tutorial</a>, where we'll take a look at how we can deal with authentication and permissions for our API.</p> <div class="_attribution">
