Pickling (and unpickling) is alternatively known as “serialization”, “marshalling,” <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id7" id="id1">1</a> or “flattening”; however, to avoid confusion, the terms used here are “pickling” and “unpickling”.</p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class="admonition-title">Warning</p> <p>The <code>pickle</code> module <strong>is not secure</strong>.

<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#module-pickle" title="pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back."><code>pickle</code></a> module keeps track of the objects it has already serialized, so that later references to the same object won’t be serialized again. <a class="reference internal" href="marshal#module-marshal" title="marshal: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back (with different constraints)."><code>marshal</code></a> doesn’t do this.</p> <p>This has implications both for recursive objects and object sharing. Recursive objects are objects that contain references to themselves. These are not handled by marshal, and in fact, attempting to marshal recursive objects will crash your Python interpreter. Object sharing happens when there are multiple references to the same object in different places in the object hierarchy being serialized. <a class="reference internal" href="#module-pickle" title="pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back."><code>pickle</code></a> stores such objects only once, and ensures that all other references point to the master copy. Shared objects remain shared, which can be very important for mutable objects.</p> </li> <li>
<a class="reference internal" href="marshal#module-marshal" title="marshal: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back (with different constraints)."><code>marshal</code></a> cannot be used to serialize user-defined classes and their instances. <a class="reference internal" href="#module-pickle" title="pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back."><code>pickle</code></a> can save and restore class instances transparently, however the class definition must be importable and live in the same module as when the object was stored.</li> <li>The <a class="reference internal" href="marshal#module-marshal" title="marshal: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back (with different constraints)."><code>marshal</code></a> serialization format is not guaranteed to be portable across Python versions. Because its primary job in life is to support <code>.pyc</code> files, the Python implementers reserve the right to change the serialization format in non-backwards compatible ways should the need arise. The <a class="reference internal" href="#module-pickle" title="pickle: Convert Python objects to streams of bytes and back."><code>pickle</code></a> serialization format is guaranteed to be backwards compatible across Python releases provided a compatible pickle protocol is chosen and pickling and unpickling code deals with Python 2 to Python 3 type differences if your data is crossing that unique breaking change language boundary.</li> </ul>   <h3 id="id2">Comparison with <code>json</code>

Trying to pickle a highly recursive data structure may exceed the maximum recursion depth, a <a class="reference internal" href="exceptions#RecursionError" title="RecursionError"><code>RecursionError</code></a> will be raised in this case. You can carefully raise this limit with <a class="reference internal" href="sys#sys.setrecursionlimit" title="sys.setrecursionlimit"><code>sys.setrecursionlimit()</code></a>.</p> <p>Note that functions (built-in and user-defined) are pickled by “fully qualified” name reference, not by value. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id8" id="id3">2</a> This means that only the function name is pickled, along with the name of the module the function is defined in.

The following code shows an implementation of this behaviour:</p> <pre data-language="python">def save(obj):

<p>The interface is currently defined as follows.

Optional items can either be omitted, or <code>None</code> can be provided as their value. The semantics of each item are in order:</p> <ul> <li>A callable object that will be called to create the initial version of the object.</li> <li>A tuple of arguments for the callable object.

These items will be appended to the object either using <code>obj.append(item)</code> or, in batch, using <code>obj.extend(list_of_items)</code>. This is primarily used for list subclasses, but may be used by other classes as long as they have <code>append()</code> and <code>extend()</code> methods with the appropriate signature. (Whether <code>append()</code> or <code>extend()</code> is used depends on which pickle protocol version is used as well as the number of items to append, so both must be supported.)</li> <li>Optionally, an iterator (not a sequence) yielding successive key-value pairs.

<p>Optionally, a callable with a <code>(obj, state)</code> signature. This callable allows the user to programmatically control the state-updating behavior of a specific object, instead of using <code>obj</code>’s static <a class="reference internal" href="#object.__setstate__" title="object.__setstate__"><code>__setstate__()</code></a> method.

new_b = pickle.loads(data)
