<h1>Releasing a version</h1> <section id="how-to-prepare-a-release"> <h2>How to Prepare a Release</h2> <p>This file gives an overview of what is necessary to build binary releases for NumPy.</p> <section id="current-build-and-release-info"> <h3>Current build and release info</h3> <p>The current info on building and releasing NumPy and SciPy is scattered in several places. It should be summarized in one place, updated, and where necessary described in more detail.

We test NumPy against all these versions every time we merge code to main. Binary installers may be available for a subset of these versions (see below).</p> <section id="os-x"> <h4>OS X</h4> <p>OS X versions &gt;= 10.9 are supported, for Python version support see <a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#nep29" title="(in NumPy Enhancement Proposals)"><span class="xref std std-ref">NEP 29</span></a>. We build binary wheels for OSX that are compatible with Python.org Python, system Python, homebrew and macports - see this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MacPython/wiki/wiki/Spinning-wheels">OSX wheel building summary</a> for details.</p> </section> <section id="windows"> <h4>Windows</h4> <p>We build 32- and 64-bit wheels on Windows. Windows 7, 8 and 10 are supported. We build NumPy using the <a class="reference external" href="https://mingwpy.github.io">mingw-w64 toolchain</a> on Appveyor.</p> </section> <section id="linux"> <h4>Linux</h4> <p>We build and ship <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513">manylinux1</a> wheels for NumPy. Many Linux distributions include their own binary builds of NumPy.</p> </section> <section id="bsd-solaris"> <h4>BSD / Solaris</h4> <p>No binaries are provided, but successful builds on Solaris and BSD have been reported.</p> </section> </section> <section id="tool-chain"> <h3>Tool chain</h3> <p>We build all our wheels on cloud infrastructure - so this list of compilers is for information and debugging builds locally. See the <code>.travis.yml</code> script in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MacPython/numpy-wheels">numpy wheels</a> repo for the definitive source of the build recipes. Packages that are available using pip are noted.</p> <section id="compilers"> <h4>Compilers</h4> <p>The same gcc version is used as the one with which Python itself is built on each platform. At the moment this means:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>OS X builds on travis currently use <code>clang</code>. It appears that binary wheels for OSX &gt;= 10.6 can be safely built from the travis-ci OSX 10.9 VMs when building against the Python from the Python.org installers;</li> <li>Windows builds use the <a class="reference external" href="https://mingwpy.github.io">mingw-w64 toolchain</a>;</li> <li>Manylinux1 wheels use the gcc provided on the Manylinux docker images.</li> </ul> <p>You will need Cython for building the binaries. Cython compiles the <code>.pyx</code> files in the NumPy distribution to <code>.c</code> files.</p> </section> <section id="openblas"> <h4>OpenBLAS</h4> <p>All the wheels link to a version of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS">OpenBLAS</a> supplied via the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MacPython/openblas-libs">openblas-libs</a> repo.

It’s best to discuss the timing on the mailing list first, in order for people to get their commits in on time, get doc wiki edits merged, etc. After a date is set, create a new maintenance/x.y.z branch, add new empty release notes for the next version in the main branch and update the Trac Milestones.</p> </section> <section id="make-sure-current-branch-builds-a-package-correctly"> <h4>Make sure current branch builds a package correctly</h4> <pre data-language="python">git clean -fxd

</pre> <p>For details of the build process itself, it is best to read the pavement.py script.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The following steps are repeated for the beta(s), release candidates(s) and the final release.</p> </div> </section> <section id="check-deprecations"> <h4>Check deprecations</h4> <p>Before the release branch is made, it should be checked that all deprecated code that should be removed is actually removed, and all new deprecations say in the docstring or deprecation warning at what version the code will be removed.</p> </section> <section id="check-the-c-api-version-number"> <h4>Check the C API version number</h4> <p>The C API version needs to be tracked in three places</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>numpy/core/setup_common.py</li> <li>numpy/core/code_generators/cversions.txt</li> <li>numpy/core/include/numpy/numpyconfig.h</li> </ul> <p>There are three steps to the process.</p> <ol class="arabic"> <li>If the API has changed, increment the C_API_VERSION in setup_common.py. The API is unchanged only if any code compiled against the current API will be backward compatible with the last released NumPy version. Any changes to C structures or additions to the public interface will make the new API not backward compatible.</li> <li>
<p>If the C_API_VERSION in the first step has changed, or if the hash of the API has changed, the cversions.txt file needs to be updated. To check the hash, run the script numpy/core/cversions.py and note the API hash that is printed. If that hash does not match the last hash in numpy/core/code_generators/cversions.txt the hash has changed. Using both the appropriate C_API_VERSION and hash, add a new entry to cversions.txt. If the API version was not changed, but the hash differs, you will need to comment out the previous entry for that API version. For instance, in NumPy 1.9 annotations were added, which changed the hash, but the API was the same as in 1.8. The hash serves as a check for API changes, but it is not definitive.</p> <p>If steps 1 and 2 are done correctly, compiling the release should not give a warning “API mismatch detect at the beginning of the build”.</p> </li> <li>The numpy/core/include/numpy/numpyconfig.h will need a new NPY_X_Y_API_VERSION macro, where X and Y are the major and minor version numbers of the release. The value given to that macro only needs to be increased from the previous version if some of the functions or macros in the include files were deprecated.</li> </ol> <p>The C ABI version number in numpy/core/setup_common.py should only be updated for a major release.</p> </section> <section id="check-the-release-notes"> <h4>Check the release notes</h4> <p>Use <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/towncrier/">towncrier</a> to build the release note and commit the changes. This will remove all the fragments from <code>doc/release/upcoming_changes</code> and add <code>doc/release/&lt;version&gt;-note.rst</code>.</p>  <p>towncrier build –version “&lt;version&gt;” git commit -m”Create release note”</p>  <p>Check that the release notes are up-to-date.</p> <p>Update the release notes with a Highlights section. Mention some of the following:</p>  <ul class="simple"> <li>major new features</li> <li>deprecated and removed features</li> <li>supported Python versions</li> <li>for SciPy, supported NumPy version(s)</li> <li>outlook for the near future</li> </ul>  </section> <section id="update-the-release-status-and-create-a-release-tag"> <h4>Update the release status and create a release “tag”</h4> <p>Identify the commit hash of the release, e.g. 1b2e1d63ff:</p> <pre data-language="python">git co 1b2e1d63ff # gives warning about detached head
</pre> <p>First, change/check the following variables in <code>pavement.py</code> depending on the release version:</p> <pre data-language="python">RELEASE_NOTES = 'doc/release/1.7.0-notes.rst'
LOG_START = 'v1.6.0'
LOG_END = 'maintenance/1.7.x'

</pre> <p>And make sure the <code>VERSION</code> variable is set properly.</p> <p>Now you can make the release commit and tag. We recommend you don’t push the commit or tag immediately, just in case you need to do more cleanup. We prefer to defer the push of the tag until we’re confident this is the exact form of the released code (see: <a class="reference internal" href="#push-tag-and-commit"><span class="std std-ref">Push the release tag and commit</span></a>):</p>  <p>git commit -s -m “REL: Release.” setup.py git tag -s &lt;version&gt;</p>  <p>The <code>-s</code> flag makes a PGP (usually GPG) signed tag. Please do sign the release tags.</p> <p>The release tag should have the release number in the annotation (tag message). Unfortunately, the name of a tag can be changed without breaking the signature, the contents of the message cannot.</p> <p>See: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/4919">https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/4919</a> for a discussion of signing release tags, and <a class="reference external" href="https://keyring.debian.org/creating-key.html">https://keyring.debian.org/creating-key.html</a> for instructions on creating a GPG key if you do not have one.</p> <p>To make your key more readily identifiable as you, consider sending your key to public keyservers, with a command such as:</p> <pre data-language="python">gpg --send-keys &lt;yourkeyid&gt;

$ git commit -a
$ git push upstream HEAD
</pre> <p>Make sure that the release tag has been pushed.</p> <p>Trigger a build by pushing a commit of your edits to the repository. Note that you can do this on a branch, but it must be pushed upstream to the <code>MacPython/numpy-wheels</code> repository to trigger uploads since only that repo has the appropriate tokens to allow uploads.</p> <p>The wheels, once built, appear at <a class="reference external" href="https://anaconda.org/multibuild-wheels-staging/numpy">https://anaconda.org/multibuild-wheels-staging/numpy</a></p> </section> <section id="make-the-release"> <h4>Make the release</h4> <p>Build the changelog and notes for upload with:</p> <pre data-language="python">paver write_release

</pre> <p>to check that the documentation is in a buildable state. Then, after tagging, create an archive of the documentation in the numpy/doc repo:</p> <pre data-language="python"># This checks out github.com/numpy/doc and adds (``git add``) the
# documentation to the checked out repo.
make merge-doc
# Now edit the ``index.html`` file in the repo to reflect the new content.

# Push to numpy/doc repo
git -C build/merge push
</pre> </section> <section id="update-pypi"> <h4>Update PyPI</h4> <p>The wheels and source should be uploaded to PyPI.</p> <p>You should upload the wheels first, and the source formats last, to make sure that pip users don’t accidentally get a source install when they were expecting a binary wheel.</p> <p>You can do this automatically using the <code>wheel-uploader</code> script from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MacPython/terryfy">https://github.com/MacPython/terryfy</a>. Here is the recommended incantation for downloading all the Windows, Manylinux, OSX wheels and uploading to PyPI.</p> <pre data-language="python">NPY_WHLS=~/wheelhouse   # local directory to cache wheel downloads
CDN_URL=https://anaconda.org/multibuild-wheels-staging/numpy/files

wheel-uploader -u $CDN_URL -w warehouse -v -s -t macosx numpy 1.11.1rc1
wheel-uploader -u $CDN_URL -w warehouse -v -s -t manylinux1 numpy 1.11.1rc1
</pre> <p>The <code>-v</code> flag gives verbose feedback, <code>-s</code> causes the script to sign the wheels with your GPG key before upload. Don’t forget to upload the wheels before the source tarball, so there is no period for which people switch from an expected binary install to a source install from PyPI.</p> <p>There are two ways to update the source release on PyPI, the first one is:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ git clean -fxd  # to be safe
$ python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip  # to check
# python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip upload --sign
</pre> <p>This will ask for your key PGP passphrase, in order to sign the built source packages.</p> <p>The second way is to upload the PKG_INFO file inside the sdist dir in the web interface of PyPI. The source tarball can also be uploaded through this interface.</p> </section> <section id="push-the-release-tag-and-commit"> <h4 id="push-tag-and-commit">Push the release tag and commit</h4> <p>Finally, now you are confident this tag correctly defines the source code that you released you can push the tag and release commit up to github:</p> <pre data-language="python">git push  # Push release commit

</pre> <p>where <code>GITHUB</code> contains your GitHub access token. The text will need to be checked for non-standard contributor names and dependabot entries removed. It is also a good idea to remove any links that may be present in the PR titles as they don’t translate well to markdown, replace them with monospaced text. The non-standard contributor names should be fixed by updating the <code>.mailmap</code> file, which is a lot of work. It is best to make several trial runs before reaching this point and ping the malefactors using a GitHub issue to get the needed information.</p> </section> <section id="finish-the-release-notes"> <h5>Finish the release notes</h5> <p>If this is the first release in a series the release note is generated, see the release note in <code>doc/release/upcoming_changes/README.rst</code> to see how to do this. Generating the release notes will also delete all the news fragment files in <code>doc/release/upcoming_changes/</code>.</p> <p>The generated release note will always need some fixups, the introduction will need to be written, and significant changes should be called out. For patch releases the changelog text may also be appended, but not for the initial release as it is too long. Check previous release notes to see how this is done. Note that the <code>:orphan:</code> markup at the top, if present, will need changing to <code>.. currentmodule:: numpy</code> and the <code>doc/source/release.rst</code> index file will need updating.</p> </section> <section id="check-the-pavement-py-file"> <h5>Check the pavement.py file</h5> <p>Check that the pavement.py file points to the correct release notes.

$ twine upload release/installers/*.whl
$ twine upload release/installers/numpy-1.21.0.zip  # Upload last.
</pre> <p>If one of the commands breaks in the middle, you may need to selectively upload the remaining files because PyPI does not allow the same file to be uploaded twice. The source file should be uploaded last to avoid synchronization problems that might occur if pip users access the files while this is in process, causing pip to build from source rather than downloading a binary wheel. PyPI only allows a single source distribution, here we have chosen the zip archive.</p> </section> <section id="upload-files-to-github"> <h4>Upload files to github</h4> <p>Go to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases">https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases</a>, there should be a <code>v1.21.0
tag</code>, click on it and hit the edit button for that tag. There are two ways to add files, using an editable text window and as binary uploads. Start by editing the <code>release/README.md</code> that is translated from the rst version using pandoc. Things that will need fixing: PR lines from the changelog, if included, are wrapped and need unwrapping, links should be changed to monospaced text. Then copy the contents to the clipboard and paste them into the text window. It may take several tries to get it look right. Then</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Upload <code>release/installers/numpy-1.21.0.tar.gz</code> as a binary file.</li> <li>Upload <code>release/installers/numpy-1.21.0.zip</code> as a binary file.</li> <li>Upload <code>release/README.rst</code> as a binary file.</li> <li>Upload <code>doc/changelog/1.21.0-changelog.rst</code> as a binary file.</li> <li>Check the pre-release button if this is a pre-releases.</li> <li>Hit the <code>{Publish,Update} release</code> button at the bottom.</li> </ul> </section> <section id="upload-documents-to-numpy-org"> <h4>Upload documents to numpy.org</h4> <p>This step is only needed for final releases and can be skipped for pre-releases and most patch releases. <code>make merge-doc</code> clones the <code>numpy/doc</code> repo into <code>doc/build/merge</code> and updates it with the new documentation:: Note that if you have a <code>local</code> numpy install, you should either remove it or install the current version for the docs to pick up the correct NumPy version.</p>  <p>$ pushd doc $ make dist $ make merge-doc $ popd</p>  <p>If the release series is a new one, you will need to add a new section to the <code>doc/build/merge/index.html</code> front page just after the “insert here” comment:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ gvim doc/build/merge/index.html +/'insert here'
</pre> <p>Otherwise, only the <code>zip</code> and <code>pdf</code> links should be updated with the new tag name:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ gvim doc/build/merge/index.html +/'tag v1.21'
</pre> <p>You can “test run” the new documentation in a browser to make sure the links work:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ firefox doc/build/merge/index.html
</pre> <p>Update the stable link:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ ln -sfn 1.21 stable
</pre> <p>Once everything seems satisfactory, commit and upload the changes:</p> <pre data-language="python">$ pushd doc/build/merge
