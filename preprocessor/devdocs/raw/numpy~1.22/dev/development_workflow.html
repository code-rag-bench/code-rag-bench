</pre> </li> <li>Optional: Compare the changes with the previous version using with <code>git
diff</code> (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html">git diff</a>). This brings up a simple text browser interface that highlights the difference between your files and the previous version.</li> <li>Add any relevant modified or new files using <code>git add modified_file</code> (see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-add.html">git add</a>). This puts the files into a staging area, which is a queue of files that will be added to your next commit. Only add files that have related, complete changes. Leave files with unfinished changes for later commits.</li> <li>
<p>To commit the staged files into the local copy of your repo, do <code>git
commit</code>. At this point, a text editor will open up to allow you to write a commit message. Read the <a class="reference internal" href="#writing-the-commit-message"><span class="std std-ref">commit message section</span></a> to be sure that you are writing a properly formatted and sufficiently detailed commit message. After saving your message and closing the editor, your commit will be saved. For trivial commits, a short commit message can be passed in through the command line using the <code>-m</code> flag. For example, <code>git commit -am "ENH: Some message"</code>.</p> <p>In some cases, you will see this form of the commit command: <code>git commit
-a</code>. The extra <code>-a</code> flag automatically commits all modified files and removes all deleted files. This can save you some typing of numerous <code>git
add</code> commands; however, it can add unwanted changes to a commit if you’re not careful. For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gitready.com/beginner/2009/01/18/the-staging-area.html">why the -a flag?</a> - and the helpful use-case description in the <a class="reference external" href="https://tomayko.com/writings/the-thing-about-git">tangled working copy problem</a>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>Push the changes to your forked repo on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy">github</a>:</p> <pre data-language="python">git push origin my-new-feature
</pre> <p>For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html">git push</a>.</p> </li> </ol> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Assuming you have followed the instructions in these pages, git will create a default link to your <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy">github</a> repo called <code>origin</code>. In git &gt;= 1.7 you can ensure that the link to origin is permanently set by using the <code>--set-upstream</code> option:</p> <pre data-language="python">git push --set-upstream origin my-new-feature
</pre> <p>From now on <a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> will know that <code>my-new-feature</code> is related to the <code>my-new-feature</code> branch in your own <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy">github</a> repo. Subsequent push calls are then simplified to the following:</p> <pre data-language="python">git push
</pre> <p>You have to use <code>--set-upstream</code> for each new branch that you create.</p> </div> <p>It may be the case that while you were working on your edits, new commits have been added to <code>upstream</code> that affect your work. In this case, follow the <a class="reference internal" href="#rebasing-on-main"><span class="std std-ref">Rebasing on main</span></a> section of this document to apply those changes to your branch.</p> </section> <section id="writing-the-commit-message"> <h4 id="id3">Writing the commit message</h4> <p>Commit messages should be clear and follow a few basic rules. Example:</p> <pre data-language="python">ENH: add functionality X to numpy.&lt;submodule&gt;.

The first line of the commit message starts with a capitalized acronym
(options listed below) indicating what type of commit this is.  Then a blank
line, then more text if needed.  Lines shouldn't be longer than 72
characters.  If the commit is related to a ticket, indicate that with
"See #3456", "See ticket 3456", "Closes #3456" or similar.
</pre> <p>Describing the motivation for a change, the nature of a bug for bug fixes or some details on what an enhancement does are also good to include in a commit message. Messages should be understandable without looking at the code changes. A commit message like <code>MAINT: fixed another one</code> is an example of what not to do; the reader has to go look for context elsewhere.</p> <p>Standard acronyms to start the commit message with are:</p> <pre data-language="python">API: an (incompatible) API change
BENCH: changes to the benchmark suite
BLD: change related to building numpy
BUG: bug fix
DEP: deprecate something, or remove a deprecated object
DEV: development tool or utility
DOC: documentation
ENH: enhancement
MAINT: maintenance commit (refactoring, typos, etc.)
REV: revert an earlier commit
STY: style fix (whitespace, PEP8)
TST: addition or modification of tests
REL: related to releasing numpy

If you do not absolutely need to do this, try to avoid doing it, except perhaps when you are finished. The first step will be to update the remote repository with new commits from upstream:</p> <pre data-language="python">git fetch upstream
</pre> <p>Next, you need to update the feature branch:</p> <pre data-language="python"># go to the feature branch
git checkout my-new-feature
# make a backup in case you mess up
git branch tmp my-new-feature
# rebase on upstream main branch
git rebase upstream/main
</pre> <p>If you have made changes to files that have changed also upstream, this may generate merge conflicts that you need to resolve. See <a class="reference internal" href="#recovering-from-mess-up"><span class="std std-ref">below</span></a> for help in this case.</p> <p>Finally, remove the backup branch upon a successful rebase:</p> <pre data-language="python">git branch -D tmp
</pre> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Rebasing on main is preferred over merging upstream back to your branch.

Luckily, in Git it is relatively straightforward to recover from such mistakes.</p> <p>If you mess up during a rebase:</p> <pre data-language="python">git rebase --abort
</pre> <p>If you notice you messed up after the rebase:</p> <pre data-language="python"># reset branch back to the saved point
git reset --hard tmp
</pre> <p>If you forgot to make a backup branch:</p> <pre data-language="python"># look at the reflog of the branch
git reflog show my-feature-branch

git branch tmp HEAD
# interactive rebase
git rebase -i 6ad92e5

pick 2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable
pick a815645 Modify it so that it works
pick eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs

# Rebase 6ad92e5..eadc391 onto 6ad92e5
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
</pre> <p>To achieve what we want, we will make the following changes to it:</p> <pre data-language="python">r 13d7934 First implementation
pick 2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable
f a815645 Modify it so that it works
f eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs
</pre> <p>This means that (i) we want to edit the commit message for <code>13d7934</code>, and (ii) collapse the last three commits into one. Now we save and quit the editor.</p> <p>Git will then immediately bring up an editor for editing the commit message.

 <p>Now all those people can do:</p> <pre data-language="python">git clone git@github.com:your-user-name/numpy.git
</pre> <p>Remember that links starting with <code>git@</code> use the ssh protocol and are read-write; links starting with <code>git://</code> are read-only.</p> <p>Your collaborators can then commit directly into that repo with the usual:</p> <pre data-language="python">git commit -am 'ENH - much better code'
git push origin my-feature-branch # pushes directly into your repo
</pre> </section> <section id="exploring-your-repository"> <h3>Exploring your repository</h3> <p>To see a graphical representation of the repository branches and commits:</p> <pre data-language="python">gitk --all
</pre> <p>To see a linear list of commits for this branch:</p> <pre data-language="python">git log
</pre> <p>You can also look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.blog/2008-04-10-say-hello-to-the-network-graph-visualizer/">network graph visualizer</a> for your <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy">github</a> repo.</p> </section> <section id="backporting"> <h3>Backporting</h3> <p>Backporting is the process of copying new feature/fixes committed in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy">numpy/main</a> back to stable release branches. To do this you make a branch off the branch you are backporting to, cherry pick the commits you want from <code>numpy/main</code>, and then submit a pull request for the branch containing the backport.</p> <ol class="arabic"> <li>
<p>First, you need to make the branch you will work on. This needs to be based on the older version of NumPy (not main):</p> <pre data-language="python"># Make a new branch based on numpy/maintenance/1.8.x,
# backport-3324 is our new name for the branch.
git checkout -b backport-3324 upstream/maintenance/1.8.x
</pre> </li> <li>
<p>Now you need to apply the changes from main to this branch using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-cherry-pick.html">git cherry-pick</a>:</p> <pre data-language="python"># Update remote
git fetch upstream
# Check the commit log for commits to cherry pick
git log upstream/main
# This pull request included commits aa7a047 to c098283 (inclusive)
# so you use the .. syntax (for a range of commits), the ^ makes the
# range inclusive.
git cherry-pick aa7a047^..c098283
...
# Fix any conflicts, then if needed:
git cherry-pick --continue
</pre> </li> <li>You might run into some conflicts cherry picking here. These are resolved the same way as merge/rebase conflicts. Except here you can use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-blame.html">git blame</a> to see the difference between main and the backported branch to make sure nothing gets screwed up.</li> <li>
<p>Push the new branch to your Github repository:</p> <pre data-language="python">git push -u origin backport-3324
</pre> </li> <li>Finally make a pull request using Github. Make sure it is against the maintenance branch and not main, Github will usually suggest you make the pull request against main.</li> </ol> </section> <section id="pushing-changes-to-the-main-repo"> <h3 id="pushing-to-main">Pushing changes to the main repo</h3> <p><em>Requires commit rights to the main NumPy repo.</em></p> <p>When you have a set of “ready” changes in a feature branch ready for NumPy’s <code>main</code> or <code>maintenance</code> branches, you can push them to <code>upstream</code> as follows:</p> <ol class="arabic"> <li>
<p>First, merge or rebase on the target branch.</p> <ol class="loweralpha"> <li>
<p>Only a few, unrelated commits then prefer rebasing:</p> <pre data-language="python">git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
</pre> <p>See <a class="reference internal" href="#rebasing-on-main"><span class="std std-ref">Rebasing on main</span></a>.</p> </li> <li>
<p>If all of the commits are related, create a merge commit:</p> <pre data-language="python">git fetch upstream
git merge --no-ff upstream/main
</pre> </li> </ol> </li> <li>
<p>Check that what you are going to push looks sensible:</p> <pre data-language="python">git log -p upstream/main..
git log --oneline --graph
</pre> </li> <li>
<p>Push to upstream:</p> <pre data-language="python">git push upstream my-feature-branch:main
</pre> </li> </ol> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>It’s usually a good idea to use the <code>-n</code> flag to <code>git push</code> to check first that you’re about to push the changes you want to the place you want.</p> </div> </section> </section><div class="_attribution">
