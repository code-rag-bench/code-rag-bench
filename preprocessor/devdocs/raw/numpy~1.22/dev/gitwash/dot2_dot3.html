<h1 id="dot2-dot3">Two and three dots in difference specs</h1> <p>Thanks to Yarik Halchenko for this explanation.</p> <p>Imagine a series of commits A, B, C, D… Imagine that there are two branches, <em>topic</em> and <em>main</em>. You branched <em>topic</em> off <em>main</em> when <em>main</em> was at commit ‘E’. The graph of the commits looks like this:</p> <pre data-language="python">     A---B---C topic
     /
D---E---F---G main
</pre> <p>Then:</p> <pre data-language="python">git diff main..topic
</pre> <p>will output the difference from G to C (i.e. with effects of F and G), while:</p> <pre data-language="python">git diff main...topic
</pre> <p>would output just differences in the topic branch (i.e. only A, B, and C).</p><div class="_attribution">
