<h1>Reporting bugs</h1> <p>File bug reports or feature requests, and make contributions (e.g. code patches), by opening a “new issue” on GitHub:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>NumPy Issues: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues">https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues</a>
</li> </ul> <p>Please give as much information as you can in the ticket. It is extremely useful if you can supply a small self-contained code snippet that reproduces the problem. Also specify the component, the version you are referring to and the milestone.</p> <p>Report bugs to the appropriate GitHub project (there is one for NumPy and a different one for SciPy).</p> <p>More information can be found on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/dev-zone.html">https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/dev-zone.html</a> website.</p><div class="_attribution">
