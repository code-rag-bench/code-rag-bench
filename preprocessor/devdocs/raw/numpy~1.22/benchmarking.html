<h1>NumPy benchmarks</h1> <p>Benchmarking NumPy with Airspeed Velocity.</p> <section id="usage"> <h2>Usage</h2> <p>Airspeed Velocity manages building and Python virtualenvs by itself, unless told otherwise. Some of the benchmarking features in <code>runtests.py</code> also tell ASV to use the NumPy compiled by <code>runtests.py</code>. To run the benchmarks, you do not need to install a development version of NumPy to your current Python environment.</p> <p>Before beginning, ensure that <em>airspeed velocity</em> is installed. By default, <code>asv</code> ships with support for anaconda and virtualenv:</p> <pre data-language="python">pip install asv
pip install virtualenv
</pre> <p>After contributing new benchmarks, you should test them locally before submitting a pull request.</p> <p>To run all benchmarks, navigate to the root NumPy directory at the command line and execute:</p> <pre data-language="python">python runtests.py --bench
</pre> <p>where <code>--bench</code> activates the benchmark suite instead of the test suite. This builds NumPy and runs all available benchmarks defined in <code>benchmarks/</code>. (Note: this could take a while. Each benchmark is run multiple times to measure the distribution in execution times.)</p> <p>To run benchmarks from a particular benchmark module, such as <code>bench_core.py</code>, simply append the filename without the extension:</p> <pre data-language="python">python runtests.py --bench bench_core
</pre> <p>To run a benchmark defined in a class, such as <code>Mandelbrot</code> from <code>bench_avx.py</code>:</p> <pre data-language="python">python runtests.py --bench bench_avx.Mandelbrot
</pre> <p>Compare change in benchmark results to another version/commit/branch:</p> <pre data-language="python">python runtests.py --bench-compare v1.6.2 bench_core
python runtests.py --bench-compare 8bf4e9b bench_core
python runtests.py --bench-compare main bench_core
</pre> <p>All of the commands above display the results in plain text in the console, and the results are not saved for comparison with future commits. For greater control, a graphical view, and to have results saved for future comparison you can run ASV commands (record results and generate HTML):</p> <pre data-language="python">cd benchmarks
asv run -n -e --python=same
asv publish
asv preview
</pre> <p>More on how to use <code>asv</code> can be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://asv.readthedocs.io/">ASV documentation</a> Command-line help is available as usual via <code>asv --help</code> and <code>asv run --help</code>.</p> </section> <section id="writing-benchmarks"> <h2>Writing benchmarks</h2> <p>See <a class="reference external" href="https://asv.readthedocs.io/">ASV documentation</a> for basics on how to write benchmarks.</p> <p>Some things to consider:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The benchmark suite should be importable with any NumPy version.</li> <li>The benchmark parameters etc. should not depend on which NumPy version is installed.</li> <li>Try to keep the runtime of the benchmark reasonable.</li> <li>Prefer ASV’s <code>time_</code> methods for benchmarking times rather than cooking up time measurements via <code>time.clock</code>, even if it requires some juggling when writing the benchmark.</li> <li>Preparing arrays etc. should generally be put in the <code>setup</code> method rather than the <code>time_</code> methods, to avoid counting preparation time together with the time of the benchmarked operation.</li> <li>Be mindful that large arrays created with <code>np.empty</code> or <code>np.zeros</code> might not be allocated in physical memory until the memory is accessed. If this is desired behaviour, make sure to comment it in your setup function. If you are benchmarking an algorithm, it is unlikely that a user will be executing said algorithm on a newly created empty/zero array. One can force pagefaults to occur in the setup phase either by calling <code>np.ones</code> or <code>arr.fill(value)</code> after creating the array,</li> </ul> </section><div class="_attribution">
