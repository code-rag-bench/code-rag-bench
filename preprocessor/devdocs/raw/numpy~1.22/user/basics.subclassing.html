<h1 id="basics-subclassing">Subclassing ndarray</h1> <section id="introduction"> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Subclassing ndarray is relatively simple, but it has some complications compared to other Python objects. On this page we explain the machinery that allows you to subclass ndarray, and the implications for implementing a subclass.</p> <section id="ndarrays-and-object-creation"> <h3>ndarrays and object creation</h3> <p>Subclassing ndarray is complicated by the fact that new instances of ndarray classes can come about in three different ways. These are:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>Explicit constructor call - as in <code>MySubClass(params)</code>. This is the usual route to Python instance creation.</li> <li>View casting - casting an existing ndarray as a given subclass</li> <li>New from template - creating a new instance from a template instance. Examples include returning slices from a subclassed array, creating return types from ufuncs, and copying arrays. See <a class="reference internal" href="#new-from-template"><span class="std std-ref">Creating new from template</span></a> for more details</li> </ol> <p>The last two are characteristics of ndarrays - in order to support things like array slicing. The complications of subclassing ndarray are due to the mechanisms numpy has to support these latter two routes of instance creation.</p> </section> </section> <section id="view-casting"> <h2 id="id1">View casting</h2> <p><em>View casting</em> is the standard ndarray mechanism by which you take an ndarray of any subclass, and return a view of the array as another (specified) subclass:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; # create a completely useless ndarray subclass
&gt;&gt;&gt; class C(np.ndarray): pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; # create a standard ndarray
&gt;&gt;&gt; arr = np.zeros((3,))
&gt;&gt;&gt; # take a view of it, as our useless subclass
&gt;&gt;&gt; c_arr = arr.view(C)
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(c_arr)
&lt;class 'C'&gt;
</pre> </section> <section id="creating-new-from-template"> <h2 id="new-from-template">Creating new from template</h2> <p>New instances of an ndarray subclass can also come about by a very similar mechanism to <a class="reference internal" href="#view-casting"><span class="std std-ref">View casting</span></a>, when numpy finds it needs to create a new instance from a template instance. The most obvious place this has to happen is when you are taking slices of subclassed arrays. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; v = c_arr[1:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(v) # the view is of type 'C'
&lt;class 'C'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; v is c_arr # but it's a new instance
False
</pre> <p>The slice is a <em>view</em> onto the original <code>c_arr</code> data. So, when we take a view from the ndarray, we return a new ndarray, of the same class, that points to the data in the original.</p> <p>There are other points in the use of ndarrays where we need such views, such as copying arrays (<code>c_arr.copy()</code>), creating ufunc output arrays (see also <a class="reference internal" href="#array-wrap"><span class="std std-ref">__array_wrap__ for ufuncs and other functions</span></a>), and reducing methods (like <code>c_arr.mean()</code>).</p> </section> <section id="relationship-of-view-casting-and-new-from-template"> <h2>Relationship of view casting and new-from-template</h2> <p>These paths both use the same machinery. We make the distinction here, because they result in different input to your methods. Specifically, <a class="reference internal" href="#view-casting"><span class="std std-ref">View casting</span></a> means you have created a new instance of your array type from any potential subclass of ndarray. <a class="reference internal" href="#new-from-template"><span class="std std-ref">Creating new from template</span></a> means you have created a new instance of your class from a pre-existing instance, allowing you - for example - to copy across attributes that are particular to your subclass.</p> </section> <section id="implications-for-subclassing"> <h2>Implications for subclassing</h2> <p>If we subclass ndarray, we need to deal not only with explicit construction of our array type, but also <a class="reference internal" href="#view-casting"><span class="std std-ref">View casting</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="#new-from-template"><span class="std std-ref">Creating new from template</span></a>. NumPy has the machinery to do this, and it is this machinery that makes subclassing slightly non-standard.</p> <p>There are two aspects to the machinery that ndarray uses to support views and new-from-template in subclasses.</p> <p>The first is the use of the <code>ndarray.__new__</code> method for the main work of object initialization, rather then the more usual <code>__init__</code> method. The second is the use of the <code>__array_finalize__</code> method to allow subclasses to clean up after the creation of views and new instances from templates.</p> <section id="a-brief-python-primer-on-new-and-init"> <h3>A brief Python primer on <code>__new__</code> and <code>__init__</code>
</h3> <p><code>__new__</code> is a standard Python method, and, if present, is called before <code>__init__</code> when we create a class instance. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__">python __new__ documentation</a> for more detail.</p> <p>For example, consider the following Python code:</p> <pre data-language="python">class C:
    def __new__(cls, *args):
        print('Cls in __new__:', cls)
        print('Args in __new__:', args)
        # The `object` type __new__ method takes a single argument.
        return object.__new__(cls)

    def __init__(self, *args):
        print('type(self) in __init__:', type(self))
        print('Args in __init__:', args)
</pre> <p>meaning that we get:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; c = C('hello')
Cls in __new__: &lt;class 'C'&gt;
Args in __new__: ('hello',)
type(self) in __init__: &lt;class 'C'&gt;
Args in __init__: ('hello',)
</pre> <p>When we call <code>C('hello')</code>, the <code>__new__</code> method gets its own class as first argument, and the passed argument, which is the string <code>'hello'</code>. After python calls <code>__new__</code>, it usually (see below) calls our <code>__init__</code> method, with the output of <code>__new__</code> as the first argument (now a class instance), and the passed arguments following.</p> <p>As you can see, the object can be initialized in the <code>__new__</code> method or the <code>__init__</code> method, or both, and in fact ndarray does not have an <code>__init__</code> method, because all the initialization is done in the <code>__new__</code> method.</p> <p>Why use <code>__new__</code> rather than just the usual <code>__init__</code>? Because in some cases, as for ndarray, we want to be able to return an object of some other class. Consider the following:</p> <pre data-language="python">class D(C):
    def __new__(cls, *args):
        print('D cls is:', cls)
        print('D args in __new__:', args)
        return C.__new__(C, *args)

    def __init__(self, *args):
        # we never get here
        print('In D __init__')
</pre> <p>meaning that:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = D('hello')
D cls is: &lt;class 'D'&gt;
D args in __new__: ('hello',)
Cls in __new__: &lt;class 'C'&gt;
Args in __new__: ('hello',)
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(obj)
&lt;class 'C'&gt;
</pre> <p>The definition of <code>C</code> is the same as before, but for <code>D</code>, the <code>__new__</code> method returns an instance of class <code>C</code> rather than <code>D</code>. Note that the <code>__init__</code> method of <code>D</code> does not get called. In general, when the <code>__new__</code> method returns an object of class other than the class in which it is defined, the <code>__init__</code> method of that class is not called.</p> <p>This is how subclasses of the ndarray class are able to return views that preserve the class type. When taking a view, the standard ndarray machinery creates the new ndarray object with something like:</p> <pre data-language="python">obj = ndarray.__new__(subtype, shape, ...
</pre> <p>where <code>subdtype</code> is the subclass. Thus the returned view is of the same class as the subclass, rather than being of class <code>ndarray</code>.</p> <p>That solves the problem of returning views of the same type, but now we have a new problem. The machinery of ndarray can set the class this way, in its standard methods for taking views, but the ndarray <code>__new__</code> method knows nothing of what we have done in our own <code>__new__</code> method in order to set attributes, and so on. (Aside - why not call <code>obj = subdtype.__new__(...</code> then? Because we may not have a <code>__new__</code> method with the same call signature).</p> </section> <section id="the-role-of-array-finalize"> <h3>The role of <code>__array_finalize__</code>
</h3> <p><code>__array_finalize__</code> is the mechanism that numpy provides to allow subclasses to handle the various ways that new instances get created.</p> <p>Remember that subclass instances can come about in these three ways:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>explicit constructor call (<code>obj = MySubClass(params)</code>). This will call the usual sequence of <code>MySubClass.__new__</code> then (if it exists) <code>MySubClass.__init__</code>.</li> <li><a class="reference internal" href="#view-casting"><span class="std std-ref">View casting</span></a></li> <li><a class="reference internal" href="#new-from-template"><span class="std std-ref">Creating new from template</span></a></li> </ol> <p>Our <code>MySubClass.__new__</code> method only gets called in the case of the explicit constructor call, so we can’t rely on <code>MySubClass.__new__</code> or <code>MySubClass.__init__</code> to deal with the view casting and new-from-template. It turns out that <code>MySubClass.__array_finalize__</code> <em>does</em> get called for all three methods of object creation, so this is where our object creation housekeeping usually goes.</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>For the explicit constructor call, our subclass will need to create a new ndarray instance of its own class. In practice this means that we, the authors of the code, will need to make a call to <code>ndarray.__new__(MySubClass,...)</code>, a class-hierarchy prepared call to <code>super().__new__(cls, ...)</code>, or do view casting of an existing array (see below)</li> <li>For view casting and new-from-template, the equivalent of <code>ndarray.__new__(MySubClass,...</code> is called, at the C level.</li> </ul> <p>The arguments that <code>__array_finalize__</code> receives differ for the three methods of instance creation above.</p> <p>The following code allows us to look at the call sequences and arguments:</p> <pre data-language="python">import numpy as np

</pre> <p>So, this class does not actually do anything interesting: it just converts any instances of its own to regular ndarray (otherwise, we’d get infinite recursion!), and adds an <code>info</code> dictionary that tells which inputs and outputs it converted. Hence, e.g.,</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.arange(5.).view(A)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = np.sin(a)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.info
{'inputs': [0]}

&gt;&gt;&gt; b.info
{'outputs': [0]}
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.arange(5.).view(A)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = np.ones(1).view(A)
&gt;&gt;&gt; c = a + b
&gt;&gt;&gt; c.info
{'inputs': [0, 1]}
&gt;&gt;&gt; a += b
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.info
{'inputs': [0, 1], 'outputs': [0]}
</pre> <p>Note that another approach would be to to use <code>getattr(ufunc,
methods)(*inputs, **kwargs)</code> instead of the <code>super</code> call. For this example, the result would be identical, but there is a difference if another operand also defines <code>__array_ufunc__</code>. E.g., lets assume that we evalulate <code>np.add(a, b)</code>, where <code>b</code> is an instance of another class <code>B</code> that has an override. If you use <code>super</code> as in the example, <code>ndarray.__array_ufunc__</code> will notice that <code>b</code> has an override, which means it cannot evaluate the result itself. Thus, it will return <code>NotImplemented</code> and so will our class <code>A</code>. Then, control will be passed over to <code>b</code>, which either knows how to deal with us and produces a result, or does not and returns <code>NotImplemented</code>, raising a <code>TypeError</code>.</p> <p>If instead, we replace our <code>super</code> call with <code>getattr(ufunc, method)</code>, we effectively do <code>np.add(a.view(np.ndarray), b)</code>. Again, <code>B.__array_ufunc__</code> will be called, but now it sees an <code>ndarray</code> as the other argument. Likely, it will know how to handle this, and return a new instance of the <code>B</code> class to us. Our example class is not set up to handle this, but it might well be the best approach if, e.g., one were to re-implement <code>MaskedArray</code> using <code>__array_ufunc__</code>.</p> <p>As a final note: if the <code>super</code> route is suited to a given class, an advantage of using it is that it helps in constructing class hierarchies. E.g., suppose that our other class <code>B</code> also used the <code>super</code> in its <code>__array_ufunc__</code> implementation, and we created a class <code>C</code> that depended on both, i.e., <code>class C(A, B)</code> (with, for simplicity, not another <code>__array_ufunc__</code> override). Then any ufunc on an instance of <code>C</code> would pass on to <code>A.__array_ufunc__</code>, the <code>super</code> call in <code>A</code> would go to <code>B.__array_ufunc__</code>, and the <code>super</code> call in <code>B</code> would go to <code>ndarray.__array_ufunc__</code>, thus allowing <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> to collaborate.</p> </section> <section id="array-wrap-for-ufuncs-and-other-functions"> <h2 id="array-wrap">
<code>__array_wrap__</code> for ufuncs and other functions</h2> <p>Prior to numpy 1.13, the behaviour of ufuncs could only be tuned using <code>__array_wrap__</code> and <code>__array_prepare__</code>. These two allowed one to change the output type of a ufunc, but, in contrast to <code>__array_ufunc__</code>, did not allow one to make any changes to the inputs.

</pre> <p>We run a ufunc on an instance of our new array:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = MySubClass(np.arange(5), info='spam')
In __array_finalize__:
   self is MySubClass([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
   obj is array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; arr2 = np.arange(5)+1
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = np.add(arr2, obj)
In __array_wrap__:
   self is MySubClass([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
   arr is array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
In __array_finalize__:
   self is MySubClass([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
   obj is MySubClass([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret
MySubClass([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret.info
'spam'
</pre> <p>Note that the ufunc (<code>np.add</code>) has called the <code>__array_wrap__</code> method with arguments <code>self</code> as <code>obj</code>, and <code>out_arr</code> as the (ndarray) result of the addition. In turn, the default <code>__array_wrap__</code> (<code>ndarray.__array_wrap__</code>) has cast the result to class <code>MySubClass</code>, and called <code>__array_finalize__</code> - hence the copying of the <code>info</code> attribute. This has all happened at the C level.</p> <p>But, we could do anything we wanted:</p> <pre data-language="python">class SillySubClass(np.ndarray):

    def __array_wrap__(self, arr, context=None):
        return 'I lost your data'
</pre> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; arr1 = np.arange(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = arr1.view(SillySubClass)
&gt;&gt;&gt; arr2 = np.arange(5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret = np.multiply(obj, arr2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; ret
'I lost your data'
</pre> <p>So, by defining a specific <code>__array_wrap__</code> method for our subclass, we can tweak the output from ufuncs. The <code>__array_wrap__</code> method requires <code>self</code>, then an argument - which is the result of the ufunc - and an optional parameter <em>context</em>. This parameter is returned by ufuncs as a 3-element tuple: (name of the ufunc, arguments of the ufunc, domain of the ufunc), but is not set by other numpy functions. Though, as seen above, it is possible to do otherwise, <code>__array_wrap__</code> should return an instance of its containing class. See the masked array subclass for an implementation.</p> <p>In addition to <code>__array_wrap__</code>, which is called on the way out of the ufunc, there is also an <code>__array_prepare__</code> method which is called on the way into the ufunc, after the output arrays are created but before any computation has been performed. The default implementation does nothing but pass through the array. <code>__array_prepare__</code> should not attempt to access the array data or resize the array, it is intended for setting the output array type, updating attributes and metadata, and performing any checks based on the input that may be desired before computation begins. Like <code>__array_wrap__</code>, <code>__array_prepare__</code> must return an ndarray or subclass thereof or raise an error.</p> </section> <section id="extra-gotchas-custom-del-methods-and-ndarray-base"> <h2>Extra gotchas - custom <code>__del__</code> methods and ndarray.base</h2> <p>One of the problems that ndarray solves is keeping track of memory ownership of ndarrays and their views. Consider the case where we have created an ndarray, <code>arr</code> and have taken a slice with <code>v = arr[1:]</code>. The two objects are looking at the same memory. NumPy keeps track of where the data came from for a particular array or view, with the <code>base</code> attribute:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; # A normal ndarray, that owns its own data
&gt;&gt;&gt; arr = np.zeros((4,))
&gt;&gt;&gt; # In this case, base is None
&gt;&gt;&gt; arr.base is None
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; # We take a view
&gt;&gt;&gt; v1 = arr[1:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; # base now points to the array that it derived from
&gt;&gt;&gt; v1.base is arr
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Take a view of a view
&gt;&gt;&gt; v2 = v1[1:]
&gt;&gt;&gt; # base points to the original array that it was derived from
&gt;&gt;&gt; v2.base is arr
True
</pre> <p>In general, if the array owns its own memory, as for <code>arr</code> in this case, then <code>arr.base</code> will be None - there are some exceptions to this - see the numpy book for more details.</p> <p>The <code>base</code> attribute is useful in being able to tell whether we have a view or the original array. This in turn can be useful if we need to know whether or not to do some specific cleanup when the subclassed array is deleted. For example, we may only want to do the cleanup if the original array is deleted, but not the views. For an example of how this can work, have a look at the <code>memmap</code> class in <code>numpy.core</code>.</p> </section> <section id="subclassing-and-downstream-compatibility"> <h2>Subclassing and Downstream Compatibility</h2> <p>When sub-classing <code>ndarray</code> or creating duck-types that mimic the <code>ndarray</code> interface, it is your responsibility to decide how aligned your APIs will be with those of numpy. For convenience, many numpy functions that have a corresponding <code>ndarray</code> method (e.g., <code>sum</code>, <code>mean</code>, <code>take</code>, <code>reshape</code>) work by checking if the first argument to a function has a method of the same name. If it exists, the method is called instead of coercing the arguments to a numpy array.</p> <p>For example, if you want your sub-class or duck-type to be compatible with numpy’s <code>sum</code> function, the method signature for this object’s <code>sum</code> method should be the following:</p> <pre data-language="python">def sum(self, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False):
...
</pre> <p>This is the exact same method signature for <code>np.sum</code>, so now if a user calls <code>np.sum</code> on this object, numpy will call the object’s own <code>sum</code> method and pass in these arguments enumerated above in the signature, and no errors will be raised because the signatures are completely compatible with each other.</p> <p>If, however, you decide to deviate from this signature and do something like this:</p> <pre data-language="python">def sum(self, axis=None, dtype=None):
...
</pre> <p>This object is no longer compatible with <code>np.sum</code> because if you call <code>np.sum</code>, it will pass in unexpected arguments <code>out</code> and <code>keepdims</code>, causing a TypeError to be raised.</p> <p>If you wish to maintain compatibility with numpy and its subsequent versions (which might add new keyword arguments) but do not want to surface all of numpy’s arguments, your function’s signature should accept <code>**kwargs</code>. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">def sum(self, axis=None, dtype=None, **unused_kwargs):
...
</pre> <p>This object is now compatible with <code>np.sum</code> again because any extraneous arguments (i.e. keywords that are not <code>axis</code> or <code>dtype</code>) will be hidden away in the <code>**unused_kwargs</code> parameter.</p> </section><div class="_attribution">
