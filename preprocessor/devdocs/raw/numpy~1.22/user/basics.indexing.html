array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
</pre> <p>That is, each index specified selects the array corresponding to the rest of the dimensions selected. In the above example, choosing 0 means that the remaining dimension of length 5 is being left unspecified, and that what is returned is an array of that dimensionality and size. It must be noted that the returned array is a <a class="reference internal" href="../glossary#term-view"><span class="xref std std-term">view</span></a>, i.e., it is not a copy of the original, but points to the same values in memory as does the original array. In this case, the 1-D array at the first position (0) is returned. So using a single index on the returned array, results in a single element being returned. That is:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x[0][2]

</pre> <p>So note that <code>x[0, 2] == x[0][2]</code> though the second case is more inefficient as a new temporary array is created after the first index that is subsequently indexed by 2.</p> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>NumPy uses C-order indexing.

Care must be taken when extracting a small portion from a large array which becomes useless after the extraction, because the small portion extracted contains a reference to the large original array whose memory will not be released until all arrays derived from it are garbage-collected. In such cases an explicit <code>copy()</code> is recommended.</p> </div> <p>The standard rules of sequence slicing apply to basic slicing on a per-dimension basis (including using a step index). Some useful concepts to remember include:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>The basic slice syntax is <code>i:j:k</code> where <em>i</em> is the starting index, <em>j</em> is the stopping index, and <em>k</em> is the step (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\neq0\)</span>). This selects the <em>m</em> elements (in the corresponding dimension) with index values <em>i</em>, <em>i + k</em>, …, <em>i + (m - 1) k</em> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(m = q + (r\neq0)\)</span> and <em>q</em> and <em>r</em> are the quotient and remainder obtained by dividing <em>j - i</em> by <em>k</em>: <em>j - i = q k + r</em>, so that <em>i + (m - 1) k &lt; j</em>. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[1:7:2]
array([1, 3, 5])
</pre> </li> <li>
<p>Negative <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> are interpreted as <em>n + i</em> and <em>n + j</em> where <em>n</em> is the number of elements in the corresponding dimension. Negative <em>k</em> makes stepping go towards smaller indices. From the above example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x[-2:10]
array([8, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[-3:3:-1]
array([7, 6, 5, 4])
</pre> </li> <li>
<p>Assume <em>n</em> is the number of elements in the dimension being sliced. Then, if <em>i</em> is not given it defaults to 0 for <em>k &gt; 0</em> and <em>n - 1</em> for <em>k &lt; 0</em> . If <em>j</em> is not given it defaults to <em>n</em> for <em>k &gt; 0</em> and <em>-n-1</em> for <em>k &lt; 0</em> . If <em>k</em> is not given it defaults to 1. Note that <code>::</code> is the same as <code>:</code> and means select all indices along this axis. From the above example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x[5:]
array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
</pre> </li> <li>
<p>If the number of objects in the selection tuple is less than <em>N</em>, then <code>:</code> is assumed for any subsequent dimensions. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = np.array([[[1],[2],[3]], [[4],[5],[6]]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; x.shape
(2, 3, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[1:2]
array([[[4],
        [5],
        [6]]])
</pre> </li> <li>An integer, <em>i</em>, returns the same values as <code>i:i+1</code> <strong>except</strong> the dimensionality of the returned object is reduced by 1. In particular, a selection tuple with the <em>p</em>-th element an integer (and all other entries <code>:</code>) returns the corresponding sub-array with dimension <em>N - 1</em>. If <em>N = 1</em> then the returned object is an array scalar. These objects are explained in <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/arrays.scalars#arrays-scalars"><span class="std std-ref">Scalars</span></a>.</li> <li>If the selection tuple has all entries <code>:</code> except the <em>p</em>-th entry which is a slice object <code>i:j:k</code>, then the returned array has dimension <em>N</em> formed by concatenating the sub-arrays returned by integer indexing of elements <em>i</em>, <em>i+k</em>, …, <em>i + (m - 1) k &lt; j</em>,</li> <li>
<p>Basic slicing with more than one non-<code>:</code> entry in the slicing tuple, acts like repeated application of slicing using a single non-<code>:</code> entry, where the non-<code>:</code> entries are successively taken (with all other non-<code>:</code> entries replaced by <code>:</code>). Thus, <code>x[ind1, ..., ind2,:]</code> acts like <code>x[ind1][..., ind2, :]</code> under basic slicing.</p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class="admonition-title">Warning</p> <p>The above is <strong>not</strong> true for advanced indexing.</p> </div> </li> <li>You may use slicing to set values in the array, but (unlike lists) you can never grow the array. The size of the value to be set in <code>x[obj] = value</code> must be (broadcastable) to the same shape as <code>x[obj]</code>.</li> <li>A slicing tuple can always be constructed as <em>obj</em> and used in the <code>x[obj]</code> notation. Slice objects can be used in the construction in place of the <code>[start:stop:step]</code> notation. For example, <code>x[1:10:5, ::-1]</code> can also be implemented as <code>obj = (slice(1, 10, 5), slice(None, None, -1)); x[obj]</code> . This can be useful for constructing generic code that works on arrays of arbitrary dimensions.

array([[1, 2, 3],

</pre> <p>Each <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/constants#numpy.newaxis" title="numpy.newaxis"><code>newaxis</code></a> object in the selection tuple serves to expand the dimensions of the resulting selection by one unit-length dimension.

We’ll start with the simplest multidimensional case:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; y = np.arange(35).reshape(5, 7)
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6],

array([ 0, 15, 30])
</pre> <p>In this case, if the index arrays have a matching shape, and there is an index array for each dimension of the array being indexed, the resultant array has the same shape as the index arrays, and the values correspond to the index set for each position in the index arrays. In this example, the first index value is 0 for both index arrays, and thus the first value of the resultant array is <code>y[0, 0]</code>. The next value is <code>y[2, 1]</code>, and the last is <code>y[4, 2]</code>.</p> <p>If the index arrays do not have the same shape, there is an attempt to broadcast them to the same shape. If they cannot be broadcast to the same shape, an exception is raised:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; y[np.array([0, 2, 4]), np.array([0, 1])]
IndexError: shape mismatch: indexing arrays could not be broadcast
together with shapes (3,) (2,)
</pre> <p>The broadcasting mechanism permits index arrays to be combined with scalars for other indices. The effect is that the scalar value is used for all the corresponding values of the index arrays:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; y[np.array([0, 2, 4]), 1]
array([ 1, 15, 29])
</pre> <p>Jumping to the next level of complexity, it is possible to only partially index an array with index arrays. It takes a bit of thought to understand what happens in such cases. For example if we just use one index array with y:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; y[np.array([0, 2, 4])]
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6],

      [28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]])
</pre> <p>It results in the construction of a new array where each value of the index array selects one row from the array being indexed and the resultant array has the resulting shape (number of index elements, size of row).</p> <p>In general, the shape of the resultant array will be the concatenation of the shape of the index array (or the shape that all the index arrays were broadcast to) with the shape of any unused dimensions (those not indexed) in the array being indexed.</p> <h4 class="rubric">Example</h4> <p>From each row, a specific element should be selected. The row index is just <code>[0, 1, 2]</code> and the column index specifies the element to choose for the corresponding row, here <code>[0, 1, 0]</code>. Using both together the task can be solved using advanced indexing:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]
array([1, 4, 5])
</pre> <p>To achieve a behaviour similar to the basic slicing above, broadcasting can be used. The function <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/generated/numpy.ix_#numpy.ix_" title="numpy.ix_"><code>ix_</code></a> can help with this broadcasting. This is best understood with an example.</p> <h4 class="rubric">Example</h4> <p>From a 4x3 array the corner elements should be selected using advanced indexing. Thus all elements for which the column is one of <code>[0, 2]</code> and the row is one of <code>[0, 3]</code> need to be selected. To use advanced indexing one needs to select all elements <em>explicitly</em>. Using the method explained previously one could write:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = np.array([[ 0,  1,  2],
...               [ 3,  4,  5],
...               [ 6,  7,  8],
...               [ 9, 10, 11]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; rows = np.array([[0, 0],
...                  [3, 3]], dtype=np.intp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; columns = np.array([[0, 2],
...                     [0, 2]], dtype=np.intp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[rows, columns]
array([[ 0,  2],
       [ 9, 11]])
</pre> <p>However, since the indexing arrays above just repeat themselves, broadcasting can be used (compare operations such as <code>rows[:, np.newaxis] + columns</code>) to simplify this:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; rows = np.array([0, 3], dtype=np.intp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; columns = np.array([0, 2], dtype=np.intp)
&gt;&gt;&gt; rows[:, np.newaxis]
array([[0],
       [3]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[rows[:, np.newaxis], columns]
array([[ 0,  2],
       [ 9, 11]])
</pre> <p>This broadcasting can also be achieved using the function <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/generated/numpy.ix_#numpy.ix_" title="numpy.ix_"><code>ix_</code></a>:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x[np.ix_(rows, columns)]

</pre> <p>Note that without the <code>np.ix_</code> call, only the diagonal elements would be selected:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x[rows, columns]
array([ 0, 11])
</pre> <p>This difference is the most important thing to remember about indexing with multiple advanced indices.</p> <h4 class="rubric">Example</h4> <p>A real-life example of where advanced indexing may be useful is for a color lookup table where we want to map the values of an image into RGB triples for display. The lookup table could have a shape (nlookup, 3). Indexing such an array with an image with shape (ny, nx) with dtype=np.uint8 (or any integer type so long as values are with the bounds of the lookup table) will result in an array of shape (ny, nx, 3) where a triple of RGB values is associated with each pixel location.</p> </section> <section id="boolean-array-indexing"> <h3>Boolean array indexing</h3> <p>This advanced indexing occurs when <em>obj</em> is an array object of Boolean type, such as may be returned from comparison operators.

array([1., 19., 18., 3.])
</pre> <p>In general if an index includes a Boolean array, the result will be identical to inserting <code>obj.nonzero()</code> into the same position and using the integer array indexing mechanism described above. <code>x[ind_1, boolean_array, ind_2]</code> is equivalent to <code>x[(ind_1,) + boolean_array.nonzero() + (ind_2,)]</code>.</p> <p>If there is only one Boolean array and no integer indexing array present, this is straightforward.

It is like concatenating the indexing result for each advanced index element.</p> <p>In the simplest case, there is only a <em>single</em> advanced index combined with a slice. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; y = np.arange(35).reshape(5,7)
&gt;&gt;&gt; y[np.array([0, 2, 4]), 1:3]
array([[ 1,  2],
       [15, 16],
       [29, 30]])
</pre> <p>In effect, the slice and index array operation are independent. The slice operation extracts columns with index 1 and 2, (i.e. the 2nd and 3rd columns), followed by the index array operation which extracts rows with index 0, 2 and 4 (i.e the first, third and fifth rows). This is equivalent to:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; y[:, 1:3][np.array([0, 2, 4]), :]
array([[ 1,  2],
       [15, 16],

</pre> <p>A single advanced index can, for example, replace a slice and the result array will be the same. However, it is a copy and may have a different memory layout. A slice is preferable when it is possible. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = np.array([[ 0,  1,  2],
...               [ 3,  4,  5],
...               [ 6,  7,  8],
...               [ 9, 10, 11]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[1:2, 1:3]
array([[4, 5]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[1:2, [1, 2]]
array([[4, 5]])
</pre> <p>The easiest way to understand a combination of <em>multiple</em> advanced indices may be to think in terms of the resulting shape. There are two parts to the indexing operation, the subspace defined by the basic indexing (excluding integers) and the subspace from the advanced indexing part. Two cases of index combination need to be distinguished:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The advanced indices are separated by a slice, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/dev/library/constants.html#Ellipsis" title="(in Python v3.11)"><code>Ellipsis</code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/constants#numpy.newaxis" title="numpy.newaxis"><code>newaxis</code></a>. For example <code>x[arr1, :, arr2]</code>.</li> <li>The advanced indices are all next to each other. For example <code>x[..., arr1, arr2, :]</code> but <em>not</em> <code>x[arr1, :, 1]</code> since <code>1</code> is an advanced index in this regard.</li> </ul> <p>In the first case, the dimensions resulting from the advanced indexing operation come first in the result array, and the subspace dimensions after that. In the second case, the dimensions from the advanced indexing operations are inserted into the result array at the same spot as they were in the initial array (the latter logic is what makes simple advanced indexing behave just like slicing).</p> <h4 class="rubric">Example</h4> <p>Suppose <code>x.shape</code> is (10, 20, 30) and <code>ind</code> is a (2, 3, 4)-shaped indexing <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/arrays.scalars#numpy.intp" title="numpy.intp"><code>intp</code></a> array, then <code>result = x[..., ind, :]</code> has shape (10, 2, 3, 4, 30) because the (20,)-shaped subspace has been replaced with a (2, 3, 4)-shaped broadcasted indexing subspace. If we let <em>i, j, k</em> loop over the (2, 3, 4)-shaped subspace then <code>result[..., i, j, k, :] = x[..., ind[i, j, k], :]</code>. This example produces the same result as <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.take#numpy.ndarray.take" title="numpy.ndarray.take"><code>x.take(ind, axis=-2)</code></a>.</p> <h4 class="rubric">Example</h4> <p>Let <code>x.shape</code> be (10, 20, 30, 40, 50) and suppose <code>ind_1</code> and <code>ind_2</code> can be broadcast to the shape (2, 3, 4). Then <code>x[:, ind_1, ind_2]</code> has shape (10, 2, 3, 4, 40, 50) because the (20, 30)-shaped subspace from X has been replaced with the (2, 3, 4) subspace from the indices. However, <code>x[:, ind_1, :, ind_2]</code> has shape (2, 3, 4, 10, 30, 50) because there is no unambiguous place to drop in the indexing subspace, thus it is tacked-on to the beginning. It is always possible to use <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.transpose#numpy.ndarray.transpose" title="numpy.ndarray.transpose"><code>.transpose()</code></a> to move the subspace anywhere desired.

This iterator object can also be indexed using basic slicing or advanced indexing as long as the selection object is not a tuple. This should be clear from the fact that <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.flat#numpy.ndarray.flat" title="numpy.ndarray.flat"><code>x.flat</code></a> is a 1-dimensional view. It can be used for integer indexing with 1-dimensional C-style-flat indices. The shape of any returned array is therefore the shape of the integer indexing object.</p> </section> <section id="assigning-values-to-indexed-arrays"> <h2 id="id5">Assigning values to indexed arrays</h2> <p>As mentioned, one can select a subset of an array to assign to using a single index, slices, and index and mask arrays. The value being assigned to the indexed array must be shape consistent (the same shape or broadcastable to the shape the index produces). For example, it is permitted to assign a constant to a slice:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = np.arange(10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[2:7] = 1
</pre> <p>or an array of the right size:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x[2:7] = np.arange(5)
</pre> <p>Note that assignments may result in changes if assigning higher types to lower types (like floats to ints) or even exceptions (assigning complex to floats or ints):</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x[1] = 1.2
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[1]
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[1] = 1.2j
TypeError: can't convert complex to int
</pre> <p>Unlike some of the references (such as array and mask indices) assignments are always made to the original data in the array (indeed, nothing else would make sense!). Note though, that some actions may not work as one may naively expect. This particular example is often surprising to people:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = np.arange(0, 50, 10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
array([ 0, 10, 20, 30, 40])
&gt;&gt;&gt; x[np.array([1, 1, 3, 1])] += 1
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
array([ 0, 11, 20, 31, 40])
</pre> <p>Where people expect that the 1st location will be incremented by 3. In fact, it will only be incremented by 1. The reason is that a new array is extracted from the original (as a temporary) containing the values at 1, 1, 3, 1, then the value 1 is added to the temporary, and then the temporary is assigned back to the original array. Thus the value of the array at <code>x[1] + 1</code> is assigned to <code>x[1]</code> three times, rather than being incremented 3 times.</p> </section> <section id="dealing-with-variable-numbers-of-indices-within-programs"> <h2 id="dealing-with-variable-indices">Dealing with variable numbers of indices within programs</h2> <p>The indexing syntax is very powerful but limiting when dealing with a variable number of indices. For example, if you want to write a function that can handle arguments with various numbers of dimensions without having to write special case code for each number of possible dimensions, how can that be done? If one supplies to the index a tuple, the tuple will be interpreted as a list of indices. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; z = np.arange(81).reshape(3, 3, 3, 3)
&gt;&gt;&gt; indices = (1, 1, 1, 1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; z[indices]
40
</pre> <p>So one can use code to construct tuples of any number of indices and then use these within an index.</p> <p>Slices can be specified within programs by using the slice() function in Python. For example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; indices = (1, 1, 1, slice(0, 2))  # same as [1, 1, 1, 0:2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; z[indices]
array([39, 40])
</pre> <p>Likewise, ellipsis can be specified by code by using the Ellipsis object:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; indices = (1, Ellipsis, 1)  # same as [1, ..., 1]
&gt;&gt;&gt; z[indices]
array([[28, 31, 34],
       [37, 40, 43],
       [46, 49, 52]])
</pre> <p>For this reason, it is possible to use the output from the <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.nonzero#numpy.ndarray.nonzero" title="numpy.ndarray.nonzero"><code>np.nonzero()</code></a> function directly as an index since it always returns a tuple of index arrays.</p> <p>Because the special treatment of tuples, they are not automatically converted to an array as a list would be. As an example:</p> <pre data-language="python">&gt;&gt;&gt; z[[1, 1, 1, 1]]  # produces a large array
array([[[[27, 28, 29],
         [30, 31, 32], ...
&gt;&gt;&gt; z[(1, 1, 1, 1)]  # returns a single value
40
</pre> </section> <section id="detailed-notes"> <h2>Detailed notes</h2> <p>These are some detailed notes, which are not of importance for day to day indexing (in no particular order):</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>The native NumPy indexing type is <code>intp</code> and may differ from the default integer array type. <code>intp</code> is the smallest data type sufficient to safely index any array; for advanced indexing it may be faster than other types.</li> <li>For advanced assignments, there is in general no guarantee for the iteration order. This means that if an element is set more than once, it is not possible to predict the final result.</li> <li>An empty (tuple) index is a full scalar index into a zero-dimensional array. <code>x[()]</code> returns a <em>scalar</em> if <code>x</code> is zero-dimensional and a view otherwise. On the other hand, <code>x[...]</code> always returns a view.</li> <li>If a zero-dimensional array is present in the index <em>and</em> it is a full integer index the result will be a <em>scalar</em> and not a zero-dimensional array. (Advanced indexing is not triggered.)</li> <li>When an ellipsis (<code>...</code>) is present but has no size (i.e. replaces zero <code>:</code>) the result will still always be an array. A view if no advanced index is present, otherwise a copy.</li> <li>The <code>nonzero</code> equivalence for Boolean arrays does not hold for zero dimensional boolean arrays.</li> <li>When the result of an advanced indexing operation has no elements but an individual index is out of bounds, whether or not an <code>IndexError</code> is raised is undefined (e.g. <code>x[[], [123]]</code> with <code>123</code> being out of bounds).</li> <li>When a <em>casting</em> error occurs during assignment (for example updating a numerical array using a sequence of strings), the array being assigned to may end up in an unpredictable partially updated state. However, if any other error (such as an out of bounds index) occurs, the array will remain unchanged.</li> <li>The memory layout of an advanced indexing result is optimized for each indexing operation and no particular memory order can be assumed.</li> <li>When using a subclass (especially one which manipulates its shape), the default <code>ndarray.__setitem__</code> behaviour will call <code>__getitem__</code> for <em>basic</em> indexing but not for <em>advanced</em> indexing. For such a subclass it may be preferable to call <code>ndarray.__setitem__</code> with a <em>base class</em> ndarray view on the data. This <em>must</em> be done if the subclasses <code>__getitem__</code> does not return views.</li> </ul> </section><div class="_attribution">
