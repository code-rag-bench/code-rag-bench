<h1 id="id1">Global State</h1> <p>NumPy has a few import-time, compile-time, or runtime options which change the global behaviour. Most of these are related to performance or for debugging purposes and will not be interesting to the vast majority of users.</p> <section id="performance-related-options"> <h2>Performance-Related Options</h2> <section id="number-of-threads-used-for-linear-algebra"> <h3>Number of Threads used for Linear Algebra</h3> <p>NumPy itself is normally intentionally limited to a single thread during function calls, however it does support multiple Python threads running at the same time. Note that for performant linear algebra NumPy uses a BLAS backend such as OpenBLAS or MKL, which may use multiple threads that may be controlled by environment variables such as <code>OMP_NUM_THREADS</code> depending on what is used. One way to control the number of threads is the package <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/threadpoolctl/">threadpoolctl</a></p> </section> <section id="madvise-hugepage-on-linux"> <h3>Madvise Hugepage on Linux</h3> <p>When working with very large arrays on modern Linux kernels, you can experience a significant speedup when <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html">transparent hugepage</a> is used. The current system policy for transparent hugepages can be seen by:</p> <pre data-language="python">cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
</pre> <p>When set to <code>madvise</code> NumPy will typically use hugepages for a performance boost. This behaviour can be modified by setting the environment variable:</p> <pre data-language="python">NUMPY_MADVISE_HUGEPAGE=0
</pre> <p>or setting it to <code>1</code> to always enable it. When not set, the default is to use madvise on Kernels 4.6 and newer. These kernels presumably experience a large speedup with hugepage support. This flag is checked at import time.</p> </section> </section> <section id="interoperability-related-options"> <h2>Interoperability-Related Options</h2> <p>The array function protocol which allows array-like objects to hook into the NumPy API is currently enabled by default. This option exists since NumPy 1.16 and is enabled by default since NumPy 1.17. It can be disabled using:</p> <pre data-language="python">NUMPY_EXPERIMENTAL_ARRAY_FUNCTION=0
</pre> <p>See also <a class="reference internal" href="arrays.classes#numpy.class.__array_function__" title="numpy.class.__array_function__"><code>numpy.class.__array_function__</code></a> for more information. This flag is checked at import time.</p> </section> <section id="debugging-related-options"> <h2>Debugging-Related Options</h2> <section id="relaxed-strides-checking"> <h3>Relaxed Strides Checking</h3> <p>The <em>compile-time</em> environment variables:</p> <pre data-language="python">NPY_RELAXED_STRIDES_DEBUG=0
NPY_RELAXED_STRIDES_CHECKING=1
</pre> <p>control how NumPy reports contiguity for arrays. The default that it is enabled and the debug mode is disabled. This setting should always be enabled. Setting the debug option can be interesting for testing code written in C which iterates through arrays that may or may not be contiguous in memory. Most users will have no reason to change these; for details see the <a class="reference internal" href="arrays.ndarray#memory-layout"><span class="std std-ref">memory layout</span></a> documentation.</p> </section> <section id="warn-if-no-memory-allocation-policy-when-deallocating-data"> <h3>Warn if no memory allocation policy when deallocating data</h3> <p>Some users might pass ownership of the data pointer to the <code>ndarray</code> by setting the <code>OWNDATA</code> flag. If they do this without setting (manually) a memory allocation policy, the default will be to call <code>free</code>. If <code>NUMPY_WARN_IF_NO_MEM_POLICY</code> is set to <code>"1"</code>, a <code>RuntimeWarning</code> will be emitted. A better alternative is to use a <code>PyCapsule</code> with a deallocator and set the <code>ndarray.base</code>.</p> </section> </section><div class="_attribution">
