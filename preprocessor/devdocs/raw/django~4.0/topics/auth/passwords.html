</pre> <p>Those are the components used for storing a User’s password, separated by the dollar-sign character and consist of: the hashing algorithm, the number of algorithm iterations (work factor), the random salt, and the resulting password hash. The algorithm is one of a number of one-way hashing or password storage algorithms Django can use; see below. Iterations describe the number of times the algorithm is run over the hash. Salt is the random seed used and the hash is the result of the one-way function.</p> <p>By default, Django uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> algorithm with a SHA256 hash, a password stretching mechanism recommended by <a class="reference external" href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-132.pdf">NIST</a>.

Again, most users shouldn’t need to do this – if you’re not sure, you probably don’t. If you do, please read on:</p> <p>Django chooses the algorithm to use by consulting the <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/settings#std:setting-PASSWORD_HASHERS"><code>PASSWORD_HASHERS</code></a> setting.

The first entry in this list (that is, <code>settings.PASSWORD_HASHERS[0]</code>) will be used to store passwords, and all the other entries are valid hashers that can be used to check existing passwords.

</pre> <p>This example enables all four included validators:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>UserAttributeSimilarityValidator</code>, which checks the similarity between the password and a set of attributes of the user.</li> <li>
<code>MinimumLengthValidator</code>, which checks whether the password meets a minimum length. This validator is configured with a custom option: it now requires the minimum length to be nine characters, instead of the default eight.</li> <li>
<code>CommonPasswordValidator</code>, which checks whether the password occurs in a list of common passwords. By default, it compares to an included list of 20,000 common passwords.</li> <li>
<code>NumericPasswordValidator</code>, which checks whether the password isn’t entirely numeric.</li> </ul> <p>For <code>UserAttributeSimilarityValidator</code> and <code>CommonPasswordValidator</code>, we’re using the default settings in this example. <code>NumericPasswordValidator</code> has no settings.</p> <p>The help texts and any errors from password validators are always returned in the order they are listed in <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/settings#std:setting-AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS"><code>AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS</code></a>.</p>   <h3 id="included-validators">Included validators</h3> <p id="s-included-validators">Django includes four validators:</p> <dl class="class"> <dt id="django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator">
<code>class MinimumLengthValidator(min_length=8)</code> </dt> <dd>
<p>Validates whether the password meets a minimum length. The minimum length can be customized with the <code>min_length</code> parameter.</p> </dd>
</dl> <dl class="class"> <dt id="django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator">

If this argument is not provided, the default is used: <code>'username', 'first_name', 'last_name', 'email'</code>. Attributes that don’t exist are ignored.</p> <p>The minimum similarity of a rejected password can be set on a scale of 0 to 1 with the <code>max_similarity</code> parameter.

</dl>   <h3 id="integrating-validation">Integrating validation</h3> <p id="s-integrating-validation">There are a few functions in <code>django.contrib.auth.password_validation</code> that you can call from your own forms or other code to integrate password validation. This can be useful if you use custom forms for password setting, or if you have API calls that allow passwords to be set, for example.</p> <dl class="function"> <dt id="django.contrib.auth.password_validation.validate_password">
<code>validate_password(password, user=None, password_validators=None)</code> </dt> <dd>
<p>Validates a password. If all validators find the password valid, returns <code>None</code>. If one or more validators reject the password, raises a <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/exceptions#django.core.exceptions.ValidationError" title="django.core.exceptions.ValidationError"><code>ValidationError</code></a> with all the error messages from the validators.</p> <p>The <code>user</code> object is optional: if it’s not provided, some validators may not be able to perform any validation and will accept any password.</p> </dd>
</dl> <dl class="function"> <dt id="django.contrib.auth.password_validation.password_changed">
<code>password_changed(password, user=None, password_validators=None)</code> </dt> <dd>
<p>Informs all validators that the password has been changed. This can be used by validators such as one that prevents password reuse. This should be called once the password has been successfully changed.</p> <p>For subclasses of <a class="reference internal" href="customizing#django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser" title="django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser"><code>AbstractBaseUser</code></a>, the password field will be marked as “dirty” when calling <a class="reference internal" href="customizing#django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser.set_password" title="django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractBaseUser.set_password"><code>set_password()</code></a> which triggers a call to <code>password_changed()</code> after the user is saved.</p> </dd>
</dl> <dl class="function"> <dt id="django.contrib.auth.password_validation.password_validators_help_texts">
<code>password_validators_help_texts(password_validators=None)</code> </dt> <dd>
<p>Returns a list of the help texts of all validators. These explain the password requirements to the user.</p> </dd>
</dl> <dl class="function"> <dt id="django.contrib.auth.password_validation.password_validators_help_text_html">
<code>password_validators_help_text_html(password_validators=None)</code> </dt> <dd>
<p>Returns an HTML string with all help texts in an <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. This is helpful when adding password validation to forms, as you can pass the output directly to the <code>help_text</code> parameter of a form field.</p> </dd>
</dl> <dl class="function"> <dt id="django.contrib.auth.password_validation.get_password_validators">
<code>get_password_validators(validator_config)</code> </dt> <dd>
<p>Returns a set of validator objects based on the <code>validator_config</code> parameter. By default, all functions use the validators defined in <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/settings#std:setting-AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS"><code>AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS</code></a>, but by calling this function with an alternate set of validators and then passing the result into the <code>password_validators</code> parameter of the other functions, your custom set of validators will be used instead. This is useful when you have a typical set of validators to use for most scenarios, but also have a special situation that requires a custom set. If you always use the same set of validators, there is no need to use this function, as the configuration from <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/settings#std:setting-AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS"><code>AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS</code></a> is used by default.</p> <p>The structure of <code>validator_config</code> is identical to the structure of <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/settings#std:setting-AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS"><code>AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS</code></a>. The return value of this function can be passed into the <code>password_validators</code> parameter of the functions listed above.</p> </dd>
</dl> <p>Note that where the password is passed to one of these functions, this should always be the clear text password - not a hashed password.</p>   <h3 id="writing-your-own-validator">Writing your own validator</h3> <p id="s-writing-your-own-validator">If Django’s built-in validators are not sufficient, you can write your own password validators. Validators have a fairly small interface. They must implement two methods:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>
<code>validate(self, password, user=None)</code>: validate a password. Return <code>None</code> if the password is valid, or raise a <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/exceptions#django.core.exceptions.ValidationError" title="django.core.exceptions.ValidationError"><code>ValidationError</code></a> with an error message if the password is not valid. You must be able to deal with <code>user</code> being <code>None</code> - if that means your validator can’t run, return <code>None</code> for no error.</li> <li>
<code>get_help_text()</code>: provide a help text to explain the requirements to the user.</li> </ul> <p>Any items in the <code>OPTIONS</code> in <a class="reference internal" href="../../ref/settings#std:setting-AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS"><code>AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS</code></a> for your validator will be passed to the constructor. All constructor arguments should have a default value.</p> <p>Here’s a basic example of a validator, with one optional setting:</p> <pre data-language="python">from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.utils.translation import gettext as _

class MinimumLengthValidator:
    def __init__(self, min_length=8):
        self.min_length = min_length

    def validate(self, password, user=None):
        if len(password) &lt; self.min_length:
            raise ValidationError(
                _("This password must contain at least %(min_length)d characters."),
                code='password_too_short',
                params={'min_length': self.min_length},
            )

    def get_help_text(self):
        return _(
            "Your password must contain at least %(min_length)d characters."
            % {'min_length': self.min_length}
        )
</pre> <p>You can also implement <code>password_changed(password, user=None</code>), which will be called after a successful password change. That can be used to prevent password reuse, for example. However, if you decide to store a user’s previous passwords, you should never do so in clear text.</p><div class="_attribution">
