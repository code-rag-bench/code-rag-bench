<h1 id="writing-your-first-django-app-part-6">Writing your first Django app, part 6</h1> <p id="s-writing-your-first-django-app-part-6">This tutorial begins where <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial05"><span class="doc">Tutorial 5</span></a> left off. We’ve built a tested web-poll application, and we’ll now add a stylesheet and an image.</p> <p>Aside from the HTML generated by the server, web applications generally need to serve additional files — such as images, JavaScript, or CSS — necessary to render the complete web page. In Django, we refer to these files as “static files”.</p> <p>For small projects, this isn’t a big deal, because you can keep the static files somewhere your web server can find it. However, in bigger projects – especially those comprised of multiple apps – dealing with the multiple sets of static files provided by each application starts to get tricky.</p> <p>That’s what <code>django.contrib.staticfiles</code> is for: it collects static files from each of your applications (and any other places you specify) into a single location that can easily be served in production.</p> <div class="admonition-where-to-get-help admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">Where to get help:</p> <p class="last">If you’re having trouble going through this tutorial, please head over to the <a class="reference internal" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/faq/help/"><span class="doc">Getting Help</span></a> section of the FAQ.</p> </div>  <h2 id="customize-your-app-s-look-and-feel">Customize your <em>app’s</em> look and feel</h2> <p id="s-customize-your-app-s-look-and-feel">First, create a directory called <code>static</code> in your <code>polls</code> directory. Django will look for static files there, similarly to how Django finds templates inside <code>polls/templates/</code>.</p> <p>Django’s <a class="reference internal" href="../ref/settings#std:setting-STATICFILES_FINDERS"><code>STATICFILES_FINDERS</code></a> setting contains a list of finders that know how to discover static files from various sources. One of the defaults is <code>AppDirectoriesFinder</code> which looks for a “static” subdirectory in each of the <a class="reference internal" href="../ref/settings#std:setting-INSTALLED_APPS"><code>INSTALLED_APPS</code></a>, like the one in <code>polls</code> we just created. The admin site uses the same directory structure for its static files.</p> <p>Within the <code>static</code> directory you have just created, create another directory called <code>polls</code> and within that create a file called <code>style.css</code>. In other words, your stylesheet should be at <code>polls/static/polls/style.css</code>. Because of how the <code>AppDirectoriesFinder</code> staticfile finder works, you can refer to this static file in Django as <code>polls/style.css</code>, similar to how you reference the path for templates.</p> <div class="admonition-static-file-namespacing admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">Static file namespacing</p> <p class="last">Just like templates, we <em>might</em> be able to get away with putting our static files directly in <code>polls/static</code> (rather than creating another <code>polls</code> subdirectory), but it would actually be a bad idea. Django will choose the first static file it finds whose name matches, and if you had a static file with the same name in a <em>different</em> application, Django would be unable to distinguish between them. We need to be able to point Django at the right one, and the best way to ensure this is by <em>namespacing</em> them. That is, by putting those static files inside <em>another</em> directory named for the application itself.</p> </div> <p>Put the following code in that stylesheet (<code>polls/static/polls/style.css</code>):</p> <div class="literal-block-wrapper docutils container" id="id1"> <div class="code-block-caption"><span class="caption-text">polls/static/polls/style.css</span></div> <pre data-language="css">li a {
    color: green;
}
</pre> </div> <p>Next, add the following at the top of <code>polls/templates/polls/index.html</code>:</p> <div class="literal-block-wrapper docutils container" id="id2"> <div class="code-block-caption"><span class="caption-text">polls/templates/polls/index.html</span></div> <pre data-language="markup">{% load static %}

&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'polls/style.css' %}"&gt;
</pre> </div> <p>The <code>{% static %}</code> template tag generates the absolute URL of static files.</p> <p>That’s all you need to do for development.</p> <p>Start the server (or restart it if it’s already running):</p>       <pre data-language="console">$ python manage.py runserver
</pre>   <div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">...\&gt;</span> py manage.py runserver
</pre></div>   <p>Reload <code>http://localhost:8000/polls/</code> and you should see that the question links are green (Django style!) which means that your stylesheet was properly loaded.</p>   <h2 id="adding-a-background-image">Adding a background-image</h2> <p id="s-adding-a-background-image">Next, we’ll create a subdirectory for images. Create an <code>images</code> subdirectory in the <code>polls/static/polls/</code> directory. Inside this directory, put an image called <code>background.gif</code>. In other words, put your image in <code>polls/static/polls/images/background.gif</code>.</p> <p>Then, add to your stylesheet (<code>polls/static/polls/style.css</code>):</p> <div class="literal-block-wrapper docutils container" id="id3"> <div class="code-block-caption"><span class="caption-text">polls/static/polls/style.css</span></div> <pre data-language="css">body {
    background: white url("images/background.gif") no-repeat;
}
</pre> </div> <p>Reload <code>http://localhost:8000/polls/</code> and you should see the background loaded in the top left of the screen.</p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p> <p class="last">The <code>{% static %}</code> template tag is not available for use in static files which aren’t generated by Django, like your stylesheet. You should always use <strong>relative paths</strong> to link your static files between each other, because then you can change <a class="reference internal" href="../ref/settings#std:setting-STATIC_URL"><code>STATIC_URL</code></a> (used by the <a class="reference internal" href="../ref/templates/builtins#std:templatetag-static"><code>static</code></a> template tag to generate its URLs) without having to modify a bunch of paths in your static files as well.</p> </div> <p>These are the <strong>basics</strong>. For more details on settings and other bits included with the framework see <a class="reference internal" href="../howto/static-files/index"><span class="doc">the static files howto</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../ref/contrib/staticfiles"><span class="doc">the staticfiles reference</span></a>. <a class="reference internal" href="../howto/static-files/deployment"><span class="doc">Deploying static files</span></a> discusses how to use static files on a real server.</p> <p>When you’re comfortable with the static files, read <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial07"><span class="doc">part 7 of this tutorial</span></a> to learn how to customize Django’s automatically-generated admin site.</p><div class="_attribution">
