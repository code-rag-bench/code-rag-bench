We’ll be turning our web-poll into a standalone Python package you can reuse in new projects and share with other people.</p> <p>If you haven’t recently completed Tutorials 1–7, we encourage you to review these so that your example project matches the one described below.</p>  <h2 id="reusability-matters">Reusability matters</h2> <p id="s-reusability-matters">It’s a lot of work to design, build, test and maintain a web application. Many Python and Django projects share common problems. Wouldn’t it be great if we could save some of this repeated work?</p> <p>Reusability is the way of life in Python. <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/">The Python Package Index (PyPI)</a> has a vast range of packages you can use in your own Python programs. Check out <a class="reference external" href="https://djangopackages.org">Django Packages</a> for existing reusable apps you could incorporate in your project. Django itself is also a normal Python package. This means that you can take existing Python packages or Django apps and compose them into your own web project. You only need to write the parts that make your project unique.</p> <p>Let’s say you were starting a new project that needed a polls app like the one we’ve been working on. How do you make this app reusable? Luckily, you’re well on the way already. In <a class="reference internal" href="tutorial01"><span class="doc">Tutorial 1</span></a>, we saw how we could decouple polls from the project-level URLconf using an <code>include</code>. In this tutorial, we’ll take further steps to make the app easy to use in new projects and ready to publish for others to install and use.</p> <div class="admonition-package-app admonition"> <p class="first admonition-title">Package? App?</p> <p>A Python <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-package" title="(in Python v3.10)"><span class="xref std std-term">package</span></a> provides a way of grouping related Python code for easy reuse. A package contains one or more files of Python code (also known as “modules”).</p> <p>A package can be imported with <code>import foo.bar</code> or <code>from foo import
bar</code>. For a directory (like <code>polls</code>) to form a package, it must contain a special file <code>__init__.py</code>, even if this file is empty.</p> <p>A Django <em>application</em> is a Python package that is specifically intended for use in a Django project. An application may use common Django conventions, such as having <code>models</code>, <code>tests</code>, <code>urls</code>, and <code>views</code> submodules.</p> <p class="last">Later on we use the term <em>packaging</em> to describe the process of making a Python package easy for others to install.

Polls
=====

Polls is a Django app to conduct web-based polls. For each question,
visitors can choose between a fixed number of answers.

Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.

Quick start
-----------

1. Add "polls" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'polls',
    ]

2. Include the polls URLconf in your project urls.py like this::

    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),

3. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the polls models.

4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   to create a poll (you'll need the Admin app enabled).

5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/ to participate in the poll.
</pre> </div> </li> <li>Create a <code>django-polls/LICENSE</code> file. Choosing a license is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but suffice it to say that code released publicly without a license is <em>useless</em>. Django and many Django-compatible apps are distributed under the BSD license; however, you’re free to pick your own license. Just be aware that your licensing choice will affect who is able to use your code. </li> <li>
<p class="first">Next we’ll create <code>pyproject.toml</code>, <code>setup.cfg</code>, and <code>setup.py</code> files which detail how to build and install the app. A full explanation of these files is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but the <a class="reference external" href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">setuptools documentation</a> has a good explanation. Create the <code>django-polls/pyproject.toml</code>, <code>django-polls/setup.cfg</code>, and <code>django-polls/setup.py</code> files with the following contents:</p> <div class="literal-block-wrapper docutils container" id="id2"> <div class="code-block-caption"><span class="caption-text">django-polls/pyproject.toml</span></div> <pre data-language="toml">[build-system]

<p class="first">Only Python modules and packages are included in the package by default. To include additional files, we’ll need to create a <code>MANIFEST.in</code> file. The setuptools docs referred to in the previous step discuss this file in more detail. To include the templates, the <code>README.rst</code> and our <code>LICENSE</code> file, create a file <code>django-polls/MANIFEST.in</code> with the following contents:</p> <div class="literal-block-wrapper docutils container" id="id5"> <div class="code-block-caption"><span class="caption-text">django-polls/MANIFEST.in</span></div> <pre data-language="text">include LICENSE

recursive-include polls/templates *
</pre> </div> </li> <li>
<p class="first">It’s optional, but recommended, to include detailed documentation with your app. Create an empty directory <code>django-polls/docs</code> for future documentation. Add an additional line to <code>django-polls/MANIFEST.in</code>:</p> <pre data-language="python">recursive-include docs *
</pre> <p>Note that the <code>docs</code> directory won’t be included in your package unless you add some files to it.

<p class="first">To install the package, use pip (you already <a class="reference internal" href="#installing-reusable-apps-prerequisites"><span class="std std-ref">installed it</span></a>, right?):</p> <pre data-language="python">python -m pip install --user django-polls/dist/django-polls-0.1.tar.gz
