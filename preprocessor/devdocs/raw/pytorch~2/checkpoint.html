<h1 id="torch-utils-checkpoint">torch.utils.checkpoint</h1> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>Checkpointing is implemented by rerunning a forward-pass segment for each checkpointed segment during backward. This can cause persistent states like the RNG state to be advanced than they would without checkpointing. By default, checkpointing includes logic to juggle the RNG state such that checkpointed passes making use of RNG (through dropout for example) have deterministic output as compared to non-checkpointed passes. The logic to stash and restore RNG states can incur a moderate performance hit depending on the runtime of checkpointed operations. If deterministic output compared to non-checkpointed passes is not required, supply <code>preserve_rng_state=False</code> to <code>checkpoint</code> or <code>checkpoint_sequential</code> to omit stashing and restoring the RNG state during each checkpoint.</p> <p>The stashing logic saves and restores the RNG state for CPU and another device type (infer the device type from Tensor arguments excluding CPU tensors by <code>_infer_device_type</code>) to the <code>run_fn</code>. If there are multiple device, device state will only be saved for devices of a single device type, and the remaining devices will be ignored. Consequently, if any checkpointed functions involve randomness, this may result in incorrect gradients. (Note that if CUDA devices are among the devices detected, it will be prioritized; otherwise, the first device encountered will be selected.) If there are no CPU-tensors, the default device type state (default value is <code>cuda</code>, and it could be set to other device by <code>DefaultDeviceType</code>) will be saved and restored. However, the logic has no way to anticipate if the user will move Tensors to a new device within the <code>run_fn</code> itself. Therefore, if you move Tensors to a new device (“new” meaning not belonging to the set of [current device + devices of Tensor arguments]) within <code>run_fn</code>, deterministic output compared to non-checkpointed passes is never guaranteed.</p> </div> <dl class="py function"> <dt class="sig sig-object py" id="torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint">

<p>Checkpoint a model or part of the model</p> <p>Activation checkpointing is a technique that trades compute for memory. Instead of keeping tensors needed for backward alive until they are used in gradient computation during backward, forward computation in checkpointed regions omits saving tensors for backward and recomputes them during the backward pass. Activation checkpointing can be applied to any part of a model.</p> <p>There are currently two checkpointing implementations available, determined by the <code>use_reentrant</code> parameter. It is recommended that you use <code>use_reentrant=False</code>. Please refer the note below for a discussion of their differences.</p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class="admonition-title">Warning</p> <p>If the <code>function</code> invocation during the backward pass differs from the forward pass, e.g., due to a global variable, the checkpointed checkpointed version may not be equivalent, potentially causing an error being raised or leading to silently incorrect gradients.</p> </div> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class="admonition-title">Warning</p> <p>If you are using the <code>use_reentrant=True</code> variant (this is currently the default), please refer to the note below for important considerations and potential limitations.</p> </div> <div class="admonition note"> <p class="admonition-title">Note</p> <p>The reentrant variant of checkpoint (<code>use_reentrant=True</code>) and the non-reentrant variant of checkpoint (<code>use_reentrant=False</code>) differ in the following ways:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>Non-reentrant checkpoint stops recomputation as soon as all needed intermediate activations have been recomputed. This feature is enabled by default, but can be disabled with <code>set_checkpoint_early_stop()</code>. Reentrant checkpoint always recomputes <code>function</code> in its entirety during the backward pass.</li> <li>The reentrant variant does not record the autograd graph during the forward pass, as it runs with the forward pass under <a class="reference internal" href="generated/torch.no_grad#torch.no_grad" title="torch.no_grad"><code>torch.no_grad()</code></a>. The non-reentrant version does record the autograd graph, allowing one to perform backward on the graph within checkpointed regions.</li> <li>The reentrant checkpoint only supports the <a class="reference internal" href="generated/torch.autograd.backward#torch.autograd.backward" title="torch.autograd.backward"><code>torch.autograd.backward()</code></a> API for the backward pass without its <code>inputs</code> argument, while the non-reentrant version supports all ways of performing the backward pass.</li> <li>At least one input and output must have <code>requires_grad=True</code> for the reentrant variant. If this condition is unmet, the checkpointed part of the model will not have gradients. The non-reentrant version does not have this requirement.</li> <li>The reentrant version does not consider tensors in nested structures (e.g., custom objects, lists, dicts, etc) as participating in autograd, while the non-reentrant version does.</li> <li>The reentrant checkpoint does not support checkpointed regions with detached tensors from the computational graph, whereas the non-reentrant version does. For the reentrant variant, if the checkpointed segment contains tensors detached using <code>detach()</code> or with <a class="reference internal" href="generated/torch.no_grad#torch.no_grad" title="torch.no_grad"><code>torch.no_grad()</code></a>, the backward pass will raise an error. This is because <code>checkpoint</code> makes all the outputs require gradients and this causes issues when a tensor is defined to have no gradient in the model.
